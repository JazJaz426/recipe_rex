They will stick or worse, burn if you cut back.)', 'the root vegetables', 'the spice mix', 'cilantro and Vietnamese garlic chili paste to garnish']","Do your prep
Combine the curry powder, black pepper, turmeric and salt in a small bowl. Get your bay leaves ready
Pick off the tough outer layer of the lemongrass. Cut each stalk into three even pieces.
Peel the carrots, sweet potato and potatoes. Cut them all into 1 inch pieces
Chop your shallots. Mince the garlic and ginger.
Skin the chicken. Give is a liberal sprinkling of salt. You are now good to go.
Shallow fry the vegetables and the chicken
A wok is great for this. If you have one use that. If you don't something around a 10 inch pot should also do the trick. You can go bigger but you will need more oil. You want the oil somewhere around 2/3 of an inch deep.
Heat 2 cups of oil over medium heat (or thereabouts - remember around 2/3 inch deep). You are going for a temperature of around 350F for the oil. Slip in a piece of sweet potato. If lively bubbles form around it you know you're good.
You'll need to do this in 2 batches. Shallow fry all the sweet potatoes and half the carrots. Use a slotted spoon to flip them around so they brown evenly. The sweet potatoes take about 3 minutes. The carrots take about 4 minutes. You are going for lightly browned on the sweet potatoes and kind of blistered looking on the carrots. When they are done transfer them to a bowl lined with paper towel.
For the second batch fry the other half of the carrots and the potatoes. Light brown on the potatoes and blistered looking for the carrots.
The oil is hot anyway so you might as well fry the chicken. GIve it around 2 minutes per side. You want colour but you aren't trying to cook the chicken through here. Transfer them to a bowl (no paper towel required) when the come out of the oil.
Make the Vietnamese chicken curry
Heat the 4 tbsp vegetable oil over medium heat in a pot large enough to hold all the ingredients. Add the shallots and sweat until they are translucent and soft. This should take 3-4 minutes.
Add the garlic and ginger and cook for another minute or so.
Turn the heat down to medium low. Push the vegetables off to one side. You should have a puddle of oil in the middle of the pan. Its time to bloom the spices. Add the spice mix. Stir to make sure all the spice is well coated in oil. You may need a splash more oil if it looks dry. Don't worry, you can spoon off some of the oil at the end if you want. Blooming the spices is really important so err on the side of a bit too much oil.
Cook the spices for about 90 seconds to 2 minutes. Be careful. You don't want the spices to burn. This step is critical. It's also a really good trick to have in your bag for anything heavy on spice (think Indian and Mexican).
Add the coconut milk, the chicken stock and 2 tbsp of fish sauce. Give it a good stir. Add the carrots, potatoes and the chicken. Hold the sweet potato back. It takes a little less time to cook sweet potatoes.
Toss in the lemongrass and bay leaf. Bring to a simmer and cook for about 10 minutes.
Add the sweet potato and cook until the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 170F for dark meat. This should take another 15 minutes. If you are using white meat you are going for 160F. Probably want to add your sweet potato in around 5 minutes sooner for white meat.
To serve garnish with cilantro. Pass the garlic chili sauce along for people to add a bit more zing if they want.

Add the wings to the bowl and toss to coat. Let the wings marinate 1-4 hours (in the refrigerator), stirring occasionally to make sure every piece marinates.
Grill the wings. I prefer charcoal but gas works as well. Set your grill up for high indirect heat. Cook the wings for about 12-15 minutes.
Move a few wings over direct heat. Watch them closely. You want them nicely crisped and brown. You don't want golden black (which is just black and nasty if you are new to this blog). Burnt wings suck.
As they brown, move them back over indirect heat. Cycle the wings through the crisping, direct heat phase until they are all just golden brown .
Continue to cook the wings over indirect heat until you get to an internal temperature of 175F or so. If you don't have an instant read thermometer please get one. Professional cooks use them. You should too.

Joint the chicken. Quarter the chicken, removing the back. Separate the thighs from the drumsticks. Remove the wings from the breasts. Cut each breast into 3 roughly equal pieces. You should have 12 pieces of chicken.
Combine the marinade ingredients. In a large bowl, toss the chicken in the marinade. Marinate for no more than 2 hours. Lemon is an acid. It ""cooks"" the chicken and can result in a mushy texture.
Make the dipping sauce
Chop the ginger, green chili and garlic as finely as you can. If you have a morter and pestle, grind them together.
Add the remaining dipping sauce ingredients and stir thoroughly to dissolve the sugar. Let stand about 1 hour before using.
Grill the chicken
Remove the chicken from marinade.
If using a gas grill, set it up for high indirect heat. Place a drip pan under the grill on the cool side. Grill the chicken over the dripping pan for about 25 minutes. Move the chicken over high heat briefly to add grill marks if desired.
If using a charcoal grill, bank the charcoal on both sides and place a drip pan in the middle. Grill the chicken over the drip pan for about 25 minutes. Move it over the charcoal carefully to add grill marks.
The noodles
Soak the noodles in hot water for 40-45 minutes to soften. Do not boil them. Please.
Heat the oil in a wok or large pan. Add the noodles and stir fry until they soften. Remove the pan from heat. Add 1/3 cup ginger lime dipping sauce. Stir briefly and add the green onion, red pepper and green chili.
Alternately you can serve this with a cool noodle salad. You need to cook the noodles first. A soak won't quite do it. Then toss the noodles with the green onion and the peppers. Drizzle with the dipping sauce and a bit of the herbs and peanuts. Works great either way. Mix it up. It will be fine.
To serve
Spread the noodle mixture on a plate. Sprinkle with cilantro, mint and peanuts - or whatever you feel like. Top with the grilled chicken and drizzle the ginger lime sauce overtop. Serve additional dipping sauce on the side.",en-US,"{'servingSize': '4 servings', 'calories': '1084 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '67 g', 'proteinContent': '45 g', 'fatContent': '70 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '39 g', 'cholesterolContent': '163 mg', 'sodiumContent': '2477 mg', 'fiberContent': '2 g', 'sugarContent': '15 g'}",-1.0,,glebe kitchen,70,4 serving(s)

Combine all the ingredients in a bowl large enough to hold the chicken and mix well.
If using chicken breasts, slice the breasts in half along the horizontal axis. You want fairly thin pieces to maximize surface area. For thighs just pound them lightly to flatten.
Add the chicken and toss to coat. Refrigerate for about an hour.
While the chicken marinates prepare the nuoc cham. Combine all the ingredients and stir. Make sure the water is good and hot. You need to make the sugar dissolve. Set aside at room temperature.
Place the rice vermicelli in a large bowl. Pour boiling water the noodles and let soak until tender. This should take about 10 minutes. Once they are just tender drain through a colander. Rinse with cold water until the noodles are cool. Set aside at room temperature.
Prep your ganishes. Wash them as needed. Pull cilantro, mint and basil leaves off the stems. Julienne any vegetables. Slice the lime. The chicken won't stay hot long so be ready to go.
Prepare your grill for high heat. The chicken will cook quickly so you don't have long to get it to colour up. Grill over high heat until just done. This doesn't take long at all. Two to three minutes per side.

Combine all the ingredients in a small sauce pan. Bring to a gentle simmer and cook for about 2 minutes. Set aside to cool. Yes, it's that easy. Which is good because rolling spring rolls is a little more of a challenge.
Cook your shrimp
Bring 3 cups of water to a boil. Add a 1/2 tsp of salt. Drop your cold, thawed shrimp into the pot. Cover. Remove from heat. Let stand exactly 6 minutes.
While they stand prepare an ice bath. In a large bowl combine ice and water.
After 6 minutes drain the shrimp and plunge into cold water to stop them from continuing to cook.
Cut each shrimp in half lengthwise. Set aside.
Make the spring rolls
Do not overstuff your spring rolls. Just don't do it. It will make you crazy. You don't want them too thin but overstuffed is just a mess waiting to happen.
Place the rice vermicelli in a large bowl. Pour hot tap water overtop to completely submerge.
Let stand around 10 minutes or so. Check. You want them a little chewy but not hard. They are probably good to go at this point. If they aren't let them soak another minute or two. Drain and rinse under cold water.
Prep your ingredients. Stem the mint leaves and cilantro. Have your lettuce and shrimp at hand. If you are using carrots or cucumbers keep them close as well.
Fill a large bowl with warm(almost hot) tap water. Not as hot as it goes but pretty warm.
You are making little rice paper burritos. Think about it like that. You want to be able to fold the ends over and then roll them up. Just like a burrito. You have to move fast. Make a couple practice rolls before you start adding the shrimp.
Put a lettuce leaf flat on a cutting board. Put a little rice vermicelli on top. Now add a few sprigs of cilantro (be generous) and roll it into a little lettuce cigar. You want it about 4-5 inches long. Set it to the side of the cutting board.
Top with julienned carrot and cucumber.
Dip a rice paper sheet in the warm water for about 2-3 seconds. It will still be firm but that's OK. Lay it flat on a cutting board. Place a couple mint leaves about a 1/3 of the way down from the side furthest away from you. Arrange the shrimp around the mint. Make sure the cut side is up.
Place the lettuce cigar in the bottom third . Carefully peel up one side (your left or right) and fold it over the filling. Repeat on the other side.
Peel up the side closest to you. Place it overtop the lettuce wrap. Now roll the whole thing away you. Be careful. The rice paper sheet will be very soft by this point. You want to start fairly tight and then relax as you roll over the shrimp.
Do this without the shrimp a couple times. It will come. Just be patient and deliberate. Once you hit your rhythm start making them with shrimp.

Remove the skin from the pork belly. You can get your butcher to do this for you. If you want to do it yourself it's not that hard if you have a good knife.

Mint']","The aromatics
Pre-heat your oven to 350F.
Roast the onion and ginger for 1 hour.
Let cool. Slice the onion in half and the ginger into 1/2 inch pieces.
The chicken
In a 5-6 quart dutch oven or pot combine the whole chicken, 4-5 green onions, the 1/2 inch piece of ginger and the salt. Add 8 cups of stock plus enough water to cover the chicken. If you can't quite cover the chicken start it breast side down.
Bring to a simmer and poach for about 20 minutes (breast side down if needed). Flip the bird and continue to poach until the chicken reaches about 155F in the breast and 165F in the thigh - about 10 minutes. Use an instant read thermometer - there's no other safe way to do this. The chicken will continue to cook after you remove it from the broth so give yourself some room. You are going for a final internal temperature of 165F in the breast and 175F in the thigh.
Set the chicken aside to cool enough to handle. Remove chicken from the bones. You don't have to be perfect. You have lots of chicken.
The broth
Remove and discard the 1/2 inch piece of ginger. Keep the stock and green onion in the pot.
Return the chicken bones to the pot along with the roasted ginger and onion.
Add the brown sugar.
Let simmer 3-4 hours, loosely covered.
Strain. You should have about 10 cups of broth. If you have less, add some water to make up for evaporation.
Refrigerate until ready for use. If you refrigerate you can skim the fat and reserve. That way you can add a tsp or so per bowl as they do in Vietnam.
When ready to serve heat the broth to just below a boil and add the fish sauce. This is where the final seasoning happens. Your broth may still under-salted. Decide for yourself. Start adding salt a half a tsp at a time. You want it pretty salty - adding in the chicken and the noodles blunts the saltiness some.
Pho ga
Do your prep. Slice or shred the chicken. Cut up some green onion. Prep your herbs. Slice your shallot as thinly as you possibly can. Slice some red chili. Cut up the lime. Pre-heat your bowls. Make sure your broth is good and hot. Have it all ready to go. Once you start things go fast and cold pho is not good pho.
Cook the noodles
Here's a trick to cook rice noodles for pho that I found buried at the bottom of an Epicurious recipe. Soak your rice noodles in cold water for about 30 minutes.
At the same time, bring a large pot of water to a boil.
Put the soaked noodles in a big strainer and drop it into the boiling water.
Stir the noodles and start checking them for texture after about 30 seconds. They should be done in under a minute. You want them slightly toothy as they will cook a bit more in the broth.
When you have them how you want them, pull the noodles and divide into 4 bowls.

bun cha - vietnamese grilled pork with rice noodles,romain | glebekitchen,https://glebekitchen.com/bun-cha-vietnamese-grilled-pork-with-rice-noodles/,Vietnamese,https://glebekitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/bunchacroptopsquare.jpg,"['2 lbs ground fresh pork', '1/4 cup fish sauce', '1/2 cup finely chopped shallots', '2 cloves crushed garlic', '1/4 cup toasted rice powder (- see notes)', '2 tsp sambal oelek', '1 tsp sugar', ""10 flat wooden skewers (don't use round ones) (- soaked in water for 30 minutes)"", '1/4 cup fish sauce', '1/4 cup sugar', ""2 tbsp fresh lime juice (- about one lime's worth)"", '1 tsp sambal oelek', '2/3 cup hot water', 'minced red chilies (- optional and to taste)', '10 oz dried rice noodles (- the thin flat ones)', 'pork balls', 'mint, cilantro, thai basil, baby greens and lime to garnish', 'nuoc cham to serve']","Pork balls
Soak 10 wooden skewers in water for at least 30 minutes.
Combine the ground pork, shallots, garlic, toasted rice powder, sugar, fish sauce and sambal oelek in a mixing bowl.
Use your hands to mix thoroughly.
Transfer half the pork mixture to a food processor. Pulse about 10-15 times. You want a big homogenous mess.
Repeat with the rest of the pork mixture. You don't want to overload your food processor. It won't mix well if you do. Let the pork mixture sit for about 30 minutes.
While the pork sits, build an indirect charcoal fire in your grill. Bank the coals on both sides and put a drip pan in the middle. If you are using gas, turn on a burner or two but leave a cool zone in the middle. You want the grill at about 500 degrees. Hot.
Here's a nifty grilling tip. To approximate a Japanese grill put two fire bricks sideways with enough space between them to sit the skewers on them. Far apart enough that the meatballs don't touch the bricks but close enough so your skewers sit on them. You don't have to do this. You can grill them how you like. But the brick trick is what I do.
Form the pork mixture into golf ball size balls. You should get around 24 balls.
Thread the pork balls onto the skewers. Take care to try to get the skewers through the middle of the balls so they are balanced. This is tough. Do what you can.
Grill the pork ball skewers until an instant read thermometer reads 160 degrees. This goes pretty fast at 500F. Under 10 minutes. Less maybe. Don't have an instant read thermometer? Time to get one. Seriously. They start at $10. Everybody should have one. Guessing is almost always wrong. Instant read is always right. You want to nail it every time don't you?
Nuoc cham
Combine all the ingredients and stir to combine. Let stand as long as you can. An hour or two isn't out of the question. 10 minutes is probably OK too.
Bun cha
At some point along the way bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook the noodles until tender. The package may or may not have instructions on it (annoying). If it doesn't 3 minutes plus or minus about a minute is usually about right. You want tender. You don't want mush. Rinse under cold water until cool.
Place a good handful of noodles in the middle of a bowl. Top with the garnishes and 5-6 pork balls.

Pick a pot that will hold the beef brisket and stock that is small enough that you can submerge the beef while it simmers.
Take a look at your brisket. Figure out which way the grain runs. You are going to need to know that when you slice it.
Combine the chicken stock, beef brisket, star anise, cinnamon stick, black cardamom, onion, ginger, salt and fish sauce. Bring to a simmer.
Simmer for about 2 to 2 1/2 hours. At this point your broth should smell like pho. Remove the beef and strain the stock through a couple sheets of paper towel or some cheesecloth. This is important if you want a nice clear broth. Add the sugar.
Chill the beef. Chill it well. An ice bath if you're in a hurry. The fridge if you're not.
Beef pho
Soak your noodles in cold water for 30 minutes. Make sure there's enough water to fully submerge them.
Slice the chilled beef as thinly as you can. Slice it against the grain. You checked which way the grain runs, right?
Heat up your pho broth. Taste it. It will need more salt. Use a mix of fish sauce and kosher salt. Creep up on it. Add about a tbsp of fish sauce. Then a 1/4 tsp of salt at a time until you hit the taste you want. It takes quite a bit.
Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Put the noodles in a strainer that will fit in the pot. Cook the noodles about 30 seconds. Try one. If it's nicely chewy you are done. If not, cook the noodles another 30 seconds. It shouldn't take more than a minute total.
Put 1/4 of the noodles in each of two bowls. Toss in the brisket. Add the rest of the noodles. Put the sliced eye of the round on top of the noodles. Sprinkle with green onions and shallots.

Add onion to the pot and cook, over low heat, stirring occasionally, until well softened. This will take about 10 minutes.
Add the garlic and cook 30 seconds.
Add the spice mix and stir constantly for about one minute. Watch out. Don't let it burn.

Cut up the lemongrass. Remove the tough outer pieces. You want the tender inside bits. If it's hard to push a sharp knife through it, it is not tender.
Combine all the marinade ingredients. That is everything except the pork in the pork and marinade section of the ingredients. Use a bowl that's big enough to hold all the pork. And give you enough room to mix it all up.
Stir to combine the marinade ingredients. Add the pork. Use your hands to mix it all up. You want the pork coated.
Cover with plastic wrap, refrigerate and marinate 1 to 12 hours. I usually go 3 or 4 hours. I've cut it back to one hour even. It works fine.
Do your prep
Make your nuoc cham. Prep your herbs. If you are making any quick pickled carrots do it now.
Soften your rice vermicelli. Bring a kettle to boil. Pick a large bowl. Pour boiling water over the noodles. Let it sit for around 5 minutes and start checking it for tenderness. Different brands take different times but I've never seen it go over 10 minutes. Probably not even 8 minutes.
When the noodles are tender drain. Rinse under cold water until cool. Set aside.
Prep your noodle bowls
You want this done before you start grilling. Or somebody else can do it while you grill.
Place 1/4 of the noodles in 4 bowls. Add your choice of garnishes. Cut up some lime. Put out the nuoc cham. All that should be left to add is the pork.
Grill the pork
This is the hard part. Grilling thinly sliced pork shoulder is not trivial.
Set up your grill for medium hot direct fire. Find something that will keep the pork from falling through the grill. A fine grill like they sell at Asian shops works. A vegetable grill (the non-stick ones with the holes in them) will work but not as well. Find something though. Do not try to grill this on your regular grate. You will wind up angry. And hungry.
Health safety tip here. You are going to need two sets of tongs. One for cooking and one to remove the pork from the grill. Be careful. Don't mix them up.
Work in batches. Don't try to grill it all at once. Try to lay it as flat as you can using the tongs. As the pork starts going opaque flip it. It will bunch up. It will fight you. Don't worry. Pork shoulder is pretty forgiving. Make sure the bunched up areas are cooked. When the first batch is finished repeat until all the pork is cooked.
Finish the bun thit nuong

Roast the beef ribs in a 325 degree oven for around 30-40 minutes. You want them to brown up a bit.
Bruise the lemongrass. Cut it in half and whack it repeatedly with the dull side of a big knife until it starts to break open.
Combine the roasted ribs (or leftover ribs from a rib roast), lemongrass, chicken stock, star anise, black cardamom, shallots and fish sauce in a pot large enough to hold all the ingredients.
Bring to a simmer and cook until the beef separates easily from the bone. This takes 90-120 minutes or so.
This next step is optional. If you like the textured bits in pho (like tendon) then go for it. If you prefer just sliced beef then leave the meat on the bones and continue simmering. Your broth will be beefier for it.
Remove the ribs from the pot. Let cool slightly. While you are at it remove everything except the shallots from the pot. Once the ribs have cooled enough to handle remove the meat and refrigerate. Return the stripped beef bones to the pot and continue simmering for a total of 4 hours. If your beef took 2 hours to get tender simmer for another 2 hours. Or, if you don't want the more interesting bits then just skip this step. Leave the beef on the bones but do remove the lemongrass, star anise and cardamom.
After 4 hours, remove the beef bones. Strain. Add enough water or stock to bring the total volume back to 6 cups. Refrigerate briefly. You want the fat to set up. There's too much at this point. Once the stock is chilled skim off the fat. Keep it handy though. Don't throw it away.
Return the skimmed stock to the pot. Bring to a simmer. Taste and adjust for salt.
Add three tablespoons of fat to a small sauce pan or frying pan. Heat over medium low heat. It will sputter for a bit as the water boils off. You should have enough fat. If you don't make up the difference with vegetable oil.
Add the bun bo Hue spice to the pan. Stir to coat the spices in oil and fry gently for about 30 seconds. Let this cool briefly and add about a tablespoon of the spice/fat mixture to the broth. Be careful. Hot fat into stock can bubble a bit. Taste and decide if it's spicy enough. If not, add a bit more and taste again. Once you have the salt and spice right your broth is done. Keep warm.
Prep the rice noodles
Soak the noodles in cool water for 30 minutes.
Bring a large pot of water to a brisk boil. A pasta pot works really well here. The type with the built in colander.
Add the pre-soaked noodles to the boiling water. Stir.
Start checking the noodles after around 30 seconds. You want them a little bit toothy. This can take a minute or so.
Remove the noodles from the hot water. Rinse with cold water. Keep the hot water handy.
Assemble the soup
Bring the broth back to a lively simmer.
Put the noodles back into the hot cooking water to warm through. This takes under 30 seconds if the water is still hot.
Divide the noodles into two bowls. Add the beef, green onions, shallots and red chili slices. Pour half the piping hot broth into each bowl.

Prepare your greens, red onion and tomatoes. Set aside.
Combine the all sauce ingredients in a small bowl. You will be deglazing your pan with this sauce.
Cook the beef
Pre-heat a heavy frying pan that will hold the steaks in a single layer over medium to medium high heat. Right before you start frying the steaks, season liberally with salt and pepper.
Turn on your ventilation fan. This is going to smoke.
Place the beef in the pan and fry around 3-4 minutes. You want a nice crust on the beef. This should get you to about medium rare. Depends on how thick your steaks are and how hot your pan is. I can't be more precise because I just don't know your specific details.
Flip the steak and cook it another 3 minutes. Remove and let rest around 10 minutes. Check your internal temperature. 125F is rare. 130 is medium rare. Remove the pan from the heat.
After the steak has rested for 10 minutes cut the beef into big bite size chunks.
Return the pan to medium low heat. Keep an eye on it. You don't want your fond to burn. Once it is heated add the garlic and cook around 30 seconds.
Turn the heat up and deglaze the pan with the sauce. Scrape up all that delicious brown gold and stir to get it to dissolve into the sauce.
As soon as you have finished deglazing the pan turn down the heat to low. Taste it. Now start adding the rice wine vinegar. You are looking for a nice balance of acid and savoury. Creep up on it.
When you get to the point you are happy with your sauce (now your vinaigrette really) return the beef to the pan. Heat through gently. You don't want it to cook more. Just warm it up.
To serve spread your greens out on a plate. Top with onions and tomatoes. Drizzle with a bit of vegetable oil. Spoon the beef onto this mixture and drizzle with the sauce. Serve with lime wedges.
