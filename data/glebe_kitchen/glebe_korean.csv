Toss the chicken wings with the marinade to coat evenly. Cover and refrigerate for 1-4 hours.
Set your grill up for indirect heat with a drip pan under the cool part of the grill (not over the burner or fire). You want a hot grill. 450-500F hot.
If you are using gas, add a little bit of smoke however you like. Soaked wood chips in a foil packet works well.
Place the wings over the cool part of the grill above the drip pan. Cook, covered, for about 10 minutes. Flip the wings.
Cook another 10 minutes. Depending on the temperature and size of wings they may be done at this point. You are going for 175-180F internal temp. If they aren't done flip them again and cook until you hit the target temp.

Bring the chicken stock to a simmer over medium low heat in a pot that is large enough to hold the stock, chicken and ultimately noodles.
Poach the chicken thighs until they reach an internal temperature of 175F. Use an instant read thermometer. Always use an instant read thermometer. This should take about 25 minutes.
Remove the chicken thighs. Set aside to cool enough to handle. Pull the chicken off the bones. You want bite size chunks. Reserve.
Strain the stock if you are worried about little bits floating around in it. Not a big deal, though. Nothing wrong with little bits. Return the stock to the pot.
Combine the gochujang, doenjang if using, miso and gochugaru in a small bowl. Add a bit of hot chicken stock to the bowl and stir to combine. You want to do it this way. If you just add the flavouring to the big pot you are going to be chasing bits of gochujang around the pot for an hour. Trust me.
Add the gochujang stock mixture to the remaining stock in the pot. Stir in the fish sauce. Taste. Adjust salt if needed. Your broth is ready.
Medium boiled eggs
In a medium saucepan, bring water to a boil. Boil large eggs for 6 minutes 30 seconds. If using extra large eggs boil them for 7 minutes 30 seconds. You may have to adjust your times slightly depending on the exact size of your eggs but this should get you pretty close.
Submerge the eggs in really cold or ice water to chill. This stops the egg yolks from continuing to set up. Peel and set aside. They will warm up in the broth.
Carefully cut the eggs in half lengthwise right before you serve. The yolk is still a bit runny so use a sharp knife.
Korean ramen
Bring the Korean ramen broth to a boil. Add the noodles and cook until done. Follow the instructions on the noodle package. Return the chicken to the broth to warm through. Slice the eggs lengthwise.
Ladle the broth, noodles and chicken into a bowl. Top with the eggs, green onions, enoki mushrooms and kimchi.

You should have 6 or so lbs of pork neck bones in total. Some will be meatier than others. Keep those for the soup. You will need to blanch and rinse all the pork so you might as well do it all up front.
Put all the pork into a pot large enough to hold it all and cover with cold water.
Bring to a boil over high heat. Boil for 5 minutes. You will see a mess of scum form. Don't worry. Down the drain it goes.
Rinse the pork well with cold running water. Set 3 lbs of meaty pork bones aside.
Place 3 lbs of the pork neck bones (pick the ones with less meat) into a pot and add the water along with the green onion and 2 whole cloves of garlic.
Bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover loosely and simmer for 4-5 hours. Longer is better if you have the time.
Strain the stock into a clean pot large enough to hold the remaining pork, potatoes and cabbage. You should have about 5-6 cups. If you have less, add water to get to 6 cups.

Combine all the ingredients in the drizzling sauce ingredient list. Stir until the sugar dissolves and the mustard and wasabi are evenly distributed. Set aside.

Mix 2 Tbsp doenjang with a bit of stock to dilute. Add the reserved pork neck bones and pork hock along thinned doenjang to the pot.
Simmer 90 minutes.
While the soup simmers, bring a pot of water large enough to hold all the cabbage to boil. Blanch the cabbage for 90 seconds. Remove the cabbage from the pot (use tongs) and cool under cold running water. Cut the cabbage into large bite size pieces.
After 90 minutes, thin the spice mix with a bit of stock and add it to the soup.
Add the potatoes and cabbage, being careful to submerge the potatoes.

Stir to combine thoroughly.
Mix the miso mixture with the beef and refrigerate 4 to 12 hours.
Pre-heat your oven to 325F.
Film a pot generously with vegetable oil. Brown the beef in batches over medium low heat. Leave room around the beef. You don't want it to steam. You want it brown. Take your time. Every stove is different. You may need to adjust the heat. Do what works for you.
Transfer the browned beef to a clean dutch oven. Add the garlic and the gochugaru to the pot.
Make your dashi. Bring the hon-dashi and water to a boil. Let simmer briefly.
Mix the gochujang with a couple tablespoons of hot dashi in a small bowl. Add a bit more dashi if needed. Get the gochujang to dissolve in the dashi. It's way easier to do this in a small bowl. Chasing miso or gochujang around a large pot is a pain.
Add the gochujang mixture. Now add enough of the remaining dashi to come up 2/3 of the way up the meat.
Cover the dutch oven with aluminum foil or parchment. Then put the lid on it.
Place in the oven and braise for about an hour. After an hour give it a stir and return it to the oven.
Beef is done when it is tender. This will take probably around 3 to 3 1/2 hours if you have big chunks. Start checking after 2 1/2 hours. There's no way to rush this. It's ready when it's ready.

Combine all the ingredients except the apple juice or water. Stir to combine thoroughly.
Use the apple juice or water to thin to the desired consistency. You want it pretty thick but you also want to be able to spread it out a bit in your wrap. Like hoisin sauce if you are familiar with that.
Make the beef bulgogi
Beef, sliced against the grain, is fundamental here. Buy a small roast. Chuck it in the freezer for about 20-30 minutes. That makes things easier. Use your sharpest knife. Slice against the grain. You are trying for about 1/8 of an inch thick. It's not dead easy but it's not that hard either...
Heat half the oil in a large skillet until it shimmers. Season the beef with a bit of salt. Add half the beef to the pan. Resist the urge to start stirring right away. Give it a minute to brown a bit. Give it a stir and cook about another minute. Remove from the pan and set aside. It doesn't have to be fully cooked at this point. It will cook a bit more in the sauce.
Repeat with the rest of the oil and remaining beef. If you get a bit of browning in the pan be happy. That's fond. You will scrape that goodness up when you add the bulgogi sauce. More flavour. More better!
Return the first half of the beef to the pan and the bulgogi sauce. If you are lucky enough to have some fond, scrape it up so it melts into the sauce. Cook over high heat, uncovered, until most of the liquid has evaporated. This takes about 2-3 minutes.

Pre-heat your broiler. Coat the ribs with a bit of vegetable oil and lay them out in a single layer on a broiler safe sheet pan. Broil until lightly browned. Rotate the sheet pan to make sure they brown evenly. When they look good, flip them and repeat. Remove from the oven. Set your oven to 325F.
Braise the ribs
Heat the vegetable oil in a large dutch oven over medium low heat. Add the onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until translucent. This takes about 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook another 30 seconds. Reduce heat to low.
Mix in the gochugaru, gochujang, shiro miso, mirin, soy, apricot jam and sesame oil. Stir to combine.
Add the chicken stock and bring to a simmer.
Add the ribs to the dutch oven. Stir. The liquid won't cover the ribs. That's OK. Resist the urge to add more stock. Put a sheet of aluminium foil over the dutch oven and cover tightly. Place the pot in the pre-heated oven.
After 30 minutes, remove the pot. Using tongs, move some of the submerged ribs up. Move the ones that were on the top down. Basically mix them up. Replace the foil and lid and return to oven.
Continue to cook for another 30-40 minutes. Check at 30 minutes. They should be fork tender but if they aren't cook them another 10 minutes. Cook them until they are tender. Tender doesn't mean mush. Mush is bad. Tender means they pull away cleanly from the bone. Maybe a little tug to get them off but the bone winds up clean.
Remove the pot from the oven. Remove the ribs to a bowl and tent with foil.
Put the sauce in a large cup or fat separator and spoon off the fat. Return the sauce to the pot. Over medium heat, reduce the sauce until it's fairly thick - like a thin BBQ sauce. This should only take around 5-8 minutes if you resisted the urge to add more liquid while cooking.
Return the ribs to pot and toss in the sauce. Garnish with sesame seeds. Serve with rice and a nice green salad. Or forget the sides and just mow down on ribs.",en-US,"{'servingSize': '6 servings', 'calories': '1333 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '20 g', 'proteinContent': '70 g', 'fatContent': '106 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '35 g', 'cholesterolContent': '348 mg', 'sodiumContent': '951 mg', 'fiberContent': '1 g', 'sugarContent': '9 g'}",4.8,,glebe kitchen,100,6 serving(s)

korean chicken wings with gochujang drizzle,glebe kitchen,https://glebekitchen.com/korean-chicken-wings-gochujang-sauce/,korea,https://glebekitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/koreanchickenwingsclose.jpg,"['2 lbs chicken wings (cut into pieces, tips discarded)', '1/2 cup flour', '1/2 cup corn starch', '2 tsp kosher salt', '1 tsp baking soda', 'oil for deep frying', '1 Tbsp rice vinegar', '1 Tbsp mirin', '2 Tbsp gochujang', '1 Tbsp soy', '1 tsp sesame oil', '1/4 tsp black pepper', '2 Tbsp sugar']","Sous vide the wings
Vacuum seal the wings.
Cook, sous vide, for 2 1/2 hours at 144F.
Remove from the water bath.
Make the gochujang drizzle
Combine the rice vinegar, mirin, gochujang, soy, sesame oil, black pepper and sugar in a small saucepan. Bring to a gentle simmer, stirring to combine. Let cool.
Fry the wings
Heat one inch of vegetable oil in a wok or cast iron pan. Alternately prepare your deep fryer. The target temperature is 375F but anywhere between 350F and 400F is OK. The chicken is already cooked. This is all about crisping up the skin.
Thoroughly combine the flour, corn starch, salt and baking soda.
Remove wings from the vacuum pack and toss with flour mixture. Place coated chicken wings on a wire rack while the oil heats.
Fry the chicken wings in batches. If you are brave, just slip the chicken into the oil with your hands. If you aren't brave, use tongs. Tongs are more cumbersome but they works fine.
Fry the chicken to colour them. They are already cooked. The frying is all about getting the coating right. That's the beauty of this recipe. It takes about 3 minutes for them to colour up nicely.
Remove wings from oil with a slotted spoon. Drizzle with gochujang sauce and serve hot and crispy.",en-US,"{'servingSize': '4 servings', 'calories': '881 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '73 g', 'proteinContent': '48 g', 'fatContent': '41 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '11 g', 'cholesterolContent': '188 mg', 'sodiumContent': '3209 mg', 'fiberContent': '1 g', 'sugarContent': '15 g'}",5.0,,glebe kitchen,200,2 serving(s)
