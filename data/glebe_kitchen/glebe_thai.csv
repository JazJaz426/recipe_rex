Combine all the ingredients except the chicken in a food processor and pulse until you get a smooth paste.

Working with two or three pieces at a time, place the chicken over direct heat and grill to crisp and colour the skin. The lid stays up the whole time. It will flare up so be ready to move it out of the way. Repeat until all the chicken is coloured up.
Return the chicken to indirect heat, cover again and cook until an instant read thermometer registers 160 for white meat and 170 for dark meat. Allow the chicken to rest briefly and serve with sweet Thai chili sauce.

Turn the heat down a bit and push the chicken to one side. Pour in the beaten eggs and film the bottom of the pan. You want it spread thin. Cook until the eggs just set up. Cut them into ribbons with your spatula. Transfer the chicken egg mixture to a bowl and set aside.

Slice the red chilies thinly into rings.
Combine the fish sauce, lime juice and chilies. It's that easy.
Make the Khao Pad
Be ready. This goes fast. Minutes. Literally
Beat your eggs. Set aside.
Use a wok if you have one. Or a really big skillet. For this dish non-stick is easier. I like carbon steel or aluminum for this. You want a pan that heats and cools quickly.
You are going to want to really play with your heat. This is easiest on a gas stove but it works on electric as well. Just slide the pan off the heat when you need it to cool down a bit.
Heat the oil over medium heat high. Add the chicken and stir fry until it starts to brown. It should be done by then but sneak a peak to make sure. Cut a piece in half and look. No harm in that.
Turn the heat down to medium low. Add the garlic and the nam prik pao (the Thai chili paste - not the fish sauce and chilies). Stir fry briefly. Watch it. A bit brown is OK. Burned is not.
Add the rice and crank the heat. Full blast at this point. You want the rice to get a toasty flavour. Toss it around. Push it up the sides. Keep it moving. Cook it this way for about 90 seconds. Maybe longer if you are waiting for your electric element to heat up.
Add the pak choy if using during the last 30 seconds or so. It cooks quickly.
Turn the heat down to medium. Push the rice to the sides and pour the eggs into the pan. Scramble them until just done.
The rice that is at the bottom of the pan will crisp up a bit. Like a soffrito in a paella. I like this. If you don't keep the rice moving as best you can while you scramble the eggs. It's near impossible but if you want to try go for it. Can't hurt.
Add the fish sauce and toss to combine. Garnish with cilantro and fresh lime wedges. Serve with the prik nam pla on the side. Prik nam pla is salty.

This is going to get intense. Toss the chilies into a skillet and toast them over low heat. You don't want them to burn so keep your heat fairly low. They should be done after about 4 or 5 minutes. Let them cool.
Slice your shallots in half. Put them in a cast iron pan, cut side down, over medium heat. Add the garlic. Dry roast until the shallots start to char. While that's happening flip the garlic every minute or so.
When the shallots are charred (check them - there's no other way) flip them over. Keep flipping your garlic. When it's all soft remove from heat and let cool. Remove the peels on both the garlic and shallot.
Combine all the ingredients except the oil.
Now the fight starts. It is not easy to puree this stuff. You can use a small food processor. That works. Kind of. Or you can grind manually in a mortar and pestle. That works better.
Sometimes, when I'm using a food processor I give up and add the oil into the mix. Technically you are supposed to fry the paste in oil. But I find when you start cooking it off some of the oil comes out. And your goal is to get the oil into the paste anyway.
Once you have pureed it pour the oil (if you haven't already added it to the paste) into a small frying pan and heat over medium low heat.
When the oil starts to shimmer add the paste and fry, stirring regularly, for about 4-5 minutes. It will darken a bit and start to give off quite a rich aroma. When you get the aroma it's done. You will get it when you get there.
Alternately, If you added the oil to get the paste to puree transfer it to a dry pan and cook over medium low heat as above.

Combine the lemongrass, sugar, cinnamon bark and water in a small sauce pan. Bring to a boil and simmer for 5 minutes.
Strain into a bowl and chill.
Add the fish sauce, soy, black pepper and sriracha and stir. Set aside while you prep your pork belly.
Prep your pork belly
Slice the pork belly lengthwise (think a piece of bacon) into somewhere between 1/4 and a 1/3 inch slices. You probably want to cut your pork belly in half (think cutting bacon in half) before you start to make this easier.
Now cut each slice into 1 inch pieces.
Combine the pork with the marinade and refrigerate for 1 to 4 hours. Longer is OK as well. There's no acid in the marinade so it's like a brine.
Make the dipping sauce
Remove the pork from the marinade. Set aside.
Pour the marinade into a small sauce pan. Bring to a boil. Let simmer for 1 minute. You are sterilizing your marinade to make the dipping sauce. Do not skip this step. Just don't.
You will see some bits formed and are floating in the marinade. These are proteins that have cooked. Strain them out.
Stir in the rice vinegar.
Make the grilled pork skewers
This is a little tricky. Take your time. Thread a piece of pork onto a skewer. Now skewer a piece of green onion. Repeat with another piece of pork and another piece of green onion. Finish with a third piece of pork. Repeat this until all the pork is skewered. You should get 10-12 skewers.
Heat your grill to somewhere between medium and medium low. Give yourself a cool safety zone. You are effectively grilling unsmoked bacon here. It's going to flare up a lot.
Grill no more than 6 skewers at a time. This isn't the place to be a hero. You are going to burn your skewers badly if try to do them all at once. Trust me. I tried to be a hero. Epic fail.
It's too hard to get internal temperature on little bits of pork belly. So you need to trust your instincts a bit. It doesn't take long to cook through. Depending on your fire you could be looking at as little as 3-5 minutes. Could be longer but not crazy long. Be careful. Look at the pictures. Try one to see.
You don't want to overcook them. Pork belly is touchy. You need to cook it until just done. Cook it longer and it gets tough. Really tough. Like I wish I'd braised it tough. Not good.
As you pull the pork belly skewers off the grill give them a good dip in the sterilized marinade.
To serve you can go a few different directions. These skewers make great party food. Serve them with a little of the marinade as a dipping sauce. Maybe put them on a platter and drizzle the marinade overtop. Pass them around like that. Or serve them up as lettuce wraps. Skewers on lettuce with marinade drizzled overtop is good eating.",en-US,"{'servingSize': '6 g', 'calories': '237 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '10 g', 'proteinContent': '4 g', 'fatContent': '20 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '7 g', 'cholesterolContent': '27 mg', 'sodiumContent': '357 mg', 'fiberContent': '1 g', 'sugarContent': '9 g'}",5.0,,glebe kitchen,90,12 serving(s)

Warm a small skillet over medium low heat. Add the coriander seed and peppercorns. Toast, stirring constantly until they just start to get aromatic. This takes about a minute.
Add the cumin seed and toast until everything smells great. This takes another 30 seconds or so.
Let cool. Transfer to a spice grinder and grind to a powder.
Combine the remaining ingredients (except the bird's eye chilies) in a small blender or food processor. This isn't a lot of stuff so either double the recipe and reserve half or use a small blender. You will need to add some or all the vegetable oil to get it to puree.
Note that this is best done in a small food processor. And it is real work. You will need to scrape down the bowl a few times to get it. Takes a few minutes. But it's way easier than using a mortar and pestle.
Taste the paste. If you can take the heat add a chopped bird's eye chili. Puree. Taste again. If you don't think it's crazy hot add another one. Keep going until you think it's crazy hot. Don't worry. The coconut milk tames everything. Crazy hot at this point should be just right for your tastes in the final curry.
Make the Thai green curry
Grab a wok or a large skillet. Add the thick coconut milk (the stuff floating on the top of the can) and bring to a lively simmer. Let it go until the cream starts to break. You will see oil separating. This oil is what you will fry the curry paste in.
This doesn't always work. At least it doesn't always work for me. I think it has to do with how thick the coconut cream is. Sometimes it's almost solid. Other times its more like whipping cream. It's not a big deal in this recipe because there is already some oil in the paste. I usually give up after 6 or 7 minutes. If it hasn't split by that point give up.
Once you see the oil or give up add the curry paste and stir to combine. Cook, stirring, until the paste loses it's pungent raw smell. It will smell mostly of the shallots at first. You are done when that smell is gone. This takes about 5 minutes.
Mix in the chicken and cook until the chicken is coloured. Add the remaining coconut milk. Simmer 5 minutes.
Add the quartered Thai eggplant, kaffir lime leaf and fish sauce. Cook until the chicken is done, another 15 minutes or so.
Add the basil and cook one minute more. Taste for salt. You may need a little more. You may not. Up to you.

Soak the rice noodles in fairly hot water for 30-45 minutes. They will turn white but still be quite firm. You want them a little toothy. Not hard. Just toothy. Pliable. 85 percent of the way there. Start checking them after about 20 minutes. This is important.
While the noodles are soaking, do your prep. Chop your vegetables. Cut the chicken into 3/4 inch cubes. Peel your shrimp if using.
Chop your peanuts. I like a mini food processor. You don't want to make peanut butter but you don't want huge pieces of peanut either. If you don't have a mini food processor chop by hand. It takes a while but you'll get there.

Return the beef to the wok along with the bean sprouts. Stir briefly and add the sauce. Add half the peanuts. Stir to combine and cook, stirring constantly, for one minute.
Add cilantro and stir.
Serve topped with the rest of the peanuts and additional cilantro.",en-US,"{'servingSize': '2 servings', 'calories': '1005 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '107 g', 'proteinContent': '29 g', 'fatContent': '47 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '10 g', 'cholesterolContent': '80 mg', 'sodiumContent': '2305 mg', 'fiberContent': '4 g', 'sugarContent': '15 g'}",5.0,,glebe kitchen,20,2 serving(s)

Don't skimp. Saving a few calories is not worth it here.)"", '1-2 red chilies (thinly sliced (optional))', 'sesame seeds (to garnish)']","This is an attempt to emulate the high heat stir fry techniques restaurants achieve with burners that are just slightly cooler than the sun. You don't have this (I don't think) so a bit of extra work is a necessary evil here.
Combine all the sauce ingredients in a small bowl. Set aside.
Prep your beef. If using sirloin a small roast (or baseball steak) works well. Put the sirloin in the freezer for about 20 minutes and then slice about as think as you can get (1/8"") across the grain. If you are using flank or skirt slice on the vertical bias (so the slice is bigger than the steak is high).
Use a wok for this if you can. It's just easier. A big frying pan will do as well. Pre-heat it over medium high heat. Add 2 tablespoon of the oil.
Turn the heat up to high. Crank it. When the oil starts to shimmer (that should happen fast) add half of the beef. Half is important. You don't want to overload your pan. You'll get steam if you do that and your beef won't brown. Cook, tossing frequently, until it gets some colour. Remove.
Add the remaining tablespoon of oil. Add the remaining beef and cook you did with the first half. Set aside.
Turn the heat down to medium. If your wok looks dry at this point add a bit more oil. Add the onions and cook until they are well softened.
Turn up the heat. Add the broccolini and stir fry until it starts to soften. Be vigorous. Toss stuff around. Like you were on TV. Have fun with it. This takes a couple minutes or more depending on how high your heat is.
You want to try to get a bit of that charred flavour on the broccolini. Push it hard. Your onions will start to really shrink and darken. Like fried shallots. That's good. After about two minutes if the onions are getting too dark add a couple tablespoons of water to the wok to cook things down a bit.
Turn the heat down to medium and add the garlic ginger paste. Cook for about 30 seconds, then add the beef back into the wok.
Add the sauce and toss until everything is warmed through. Add the cornstarch-water mixture and simmer until the sauce just starts to cling to the broccolini. Taste. If you think it isn't salty enough let it cook another minute to concentrate the flavours a bit. Remove from heat. Add the red chilies if using.
Garnish with sesame seeds and serve with jasmine rice.",en-US,"{'calories': '513 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '21 g', 'proteinContent': '45 g', 'fatContent': '27 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '4 g', 'cholesterolContent': '94 mg', 'sodiumContent': '1681 mg', 'fiberContent': '3 g', 'sugarContent': '8 g', 'servingSize': '1 serving'}",5.0,,glebe kitchen,25,2 serving(s)

Combine all the rub ingredients together in a food processor and pulse until you have a coarse paste. This may take scraping the bowl a fair bit to get it all to work if your food processor is large. Alternately, crush the dry ingredients together in a mortar and pestle, then combine with the fish sauce.
Coat the top of the ribs with the rub and let stand one hour at room temperature or up to four hours in the refrigerator.
While the ribs marinate pre-heat your grill to about 350F. Charcoal is best but if you are using a gas grill add some wood chips if you can. A bit of smoke is great here.
Grill the ribs until you reach an internal temperature of 190F. This will take one to one and half hours depending on how meaty your ribs are.
Slice the ribs individually and serve with the dipping sauce.
Hot and sweet dipping sauce
Combine the rice wine and sugar in a small saucepan over medium low heat. Stir until the sugar dissolves and then simmer a few minutes more.
Off heat, add the crushed garlic and chili pepper flakes. Let stand for 10-15 minutes and taste.
