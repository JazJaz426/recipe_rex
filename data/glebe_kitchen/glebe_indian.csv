Heat the oil in a dutch oven over medium heat.
Work in batches. Lightly brown the meat in batches. Don't crowd the meat. Leave a half inch around pieces. It doesn't have to be super brown like when making a good French stew but it does need to be brown. Set the beef aside.
If you need more oil add it now. Then add the onions to the same pot used to brown the beef. Cook until soft and well browned, about 10 minutes. Regulate the heat so the onions don't burn.
Reduce heat to medium low. Move the onions to the outer edges and add a splash of oil. Add the whole spices (cloves, cardamom, cinnamon and bay) and cook about 30 seconds.
Leaving the onions on the edge, add the spice mix. Cook for around 90 seconds, stirring constantly. You want enough oil to keep everything wet. If it looks dry, add a Tbsp or two of vegetable oil.
Mix in the garlic ginger paste and cook another 30 seconds or so.
Return the meat and accumulated juices and scrape up any browned bits in the bottom of the pot.
Now mix in the yoghurt one Tbsp at a time. Stir it in before adding the next one. I don't know why this is important but Madhur Jaffrey says so. I still do it. It has never gone wrong. Probably, it doesn't make any difference but, well, Madhur says so and who am I to differ.
Now add a big tsp of salt with enough water to almost cover the meat.
Cover and place in the pre-heated oven. Cook until the meat is tender, about 2-2 1/2 hours. Give it a stir every 30 minutes.
When the beef is tender remove the pot from the oven and place over medium low heat. If the curry is dry, add a bit of water. If it's wet, simmer uncovered to reduce. You want the sauce to be the consistency of heavy cream.
Let stand a couple minutes to allow the oil to separate. Spoon it off carefully. You should get nearly all your 1/2 cup of oil back. If you don't mind the calories though, leave some of it in the curry. That oil is loaded with spice flavour.
Adjust salt and add the cherry tomatoes. Simmer for about 5 minutes.

Pre-heat a small skillet over medium-low heat.
Add the spices except the kashmiri chilies to the skillet.
Toast, shaking the pan, until they just start to get fragrant. This should take a two or three minutes. Add the kashmiri chilies and toast until the chilies start to colour. This happens fast so pay attention.
Let cool and grind to a powder with little chunks in it. Not super fine but not coarse either. Fine with little coarse bits in it. I should take a picture. I like a coffee grinder for this. The old ones with the blade work well. Not the best for coffee. Great for spices.
You won't need all of it so transfer it to a jar with a tight fitting lid and store in a cool, dark place so it's ready for next time.
Do your prep
Measure out your spice mix. Prep your chicken. Measure out a cup (237 ml) of Indian hotel curry gravy. Cut up your green chilies if using.
Make sure you have everything ready to go.
Make the achari chicken curry
Heat the oil in a medium sized frying pan until the oil just starts to shimmer.
Stir in the garlic ginger paste. Gently fry until the garlic ginger paste stops sputtering. This can get a little messy.
Turn your heat down to medium low and add your spice mix. Cook for about 30 seconds. You want to fry your spices in the oil. Don't skimp on the oil. Bad things happen if the spices stick and burn.
Add the green chilies if you are using them. Cook another 30 seconds or so.
Add the Indian hotel curry gravy. Stir it really well to get the oil to combine with the curry gravy. You want everything mixed together at this point. Bring to a simmer.
Add the chicken thigh pieces in a single layer. Nestle them down into the sauce. Cover and ccok about 5 minutes. Remove the cover, flip the chicken and recover. Cook until the chicken is done. Use an instant read thermometer if you have one. You are shooting for an internal temperature of 160F. It will get to 170F as the curry finishes cooking.
Add the garlic pickle (or whatever pickle you decide to use) and the optional naga pickle if using. Stir well to combine.
Look at the consistency. You have a decision to make. If the chicken threw a lot of liquid the sauce might be right. If not, add a tablespoon or two of chicken stock and mix it in. Look again. If you are happy with it, cover and simmer for 2 minutes. If it's still too thick, add a bit morestock. I've never added more than a 1/4 cup.

Heat your frying pan (don't use non-stick) briefly over medium heat. Add the oil.

Turn the heat up to medium high. This is also really important. The heat is what caramelizes the onion in the curry base and gives the curry it's Indian restaurant flavour. As you become more comfortable with this technique try pushing it.

This goes fast. Be ready. Make your spice mix. Get your ingredients out and close to the stove.
Make the Ceylon chicken curry
Heat the oil in a medium frying pan until it just starts to shimmer.
Add the green cardamom, cassia bark and curry leaves. Cook about 30 seconds. You want to see little bubbles forming around your whole spices. It you don't get them right from the start heat your oil a little more next time. What you don't want to do is panic and crank the heat. You will just wind up burning things in the next step.
Stir in the garlic ginger paste and green chilies. Cook until the garlic ginger paste stops sputtering.
Turn your heat to medium low and add your spice mix. This is why you added a full 3 tablespoons of oil at the beginning. You want your spices to fry in the oil. Too little oil and the spices will stick or burn and you will be starting over.
Gently fry the spices in the oil, stirring constantly, for about 30 seconds. This is where magic happens. Volatile compounds in the spices will be released into the oil. And that is big flavour.
Turn the heat up to medium. Add the Indian hotel curry gravy. Bring to a simmer. Really stir it to get the oil to combine and cook for about a minute. You don't need it to fry hard like a regular restaurant curry. That's the beauty of hotel style. You already have that done. No need to make a mess of your stove.
Add the chicken in an even layer and cover the pan. After about 5 minutes flip the chicken pieces. Tongs are good for this. Can't beat a good set of restaurant tongs in the kitche. Cook until the chicken is just done.
The chicken should take around 8-12 minutes to cook through. It really depends on how large the chicken thigh pieces are. Best bet is to use an instant read thermometer and go for 170F.
Once the chicken is done, stir in the coconut milk and tamarind paste. Simmer for one minute.
The texture should be about right at this point. If it's too thick add a bit of water or chicken stock Not a lot. Probably a couple tablespoons max.
If it is too thin (chicken throws a fair bit of liquid as it cooks) just let the curry simmer uncovered for a minute or two.
Taste and decide if you fall in the slightly sweet camp. If you do add the sugar and stir. It will open up the flavours a bit. I like it.

Stem and seed the kashmiri chilies (not the ones in the curry - just the ones in the paste).
Soak your kashmiri chilies in hot, hot water for a few minutes. Drain and repeat. Repeat again. You may not need the third soak. You want them hydrated. Soft.
Combine all the ingredients in a mini food processor or your blender.
Puree. It will probably fight you. Scrape it down into the bowl try again. If that doesn't work add a bit more water and try again. You don't want a ton of water so add a bit at time. If it still doesn't go, add a bit more. Until it does go. Super annoying. I know.
Make your lamb vindaloo
Do your prep. The vindaloo paste is ready to go, right? You've pre-cooked your lamb? Combine the Indian restaurant spice mix, kashmiri chili powder, kasoor methi and salt in a small bowl. Preheat your curry base. Dilute the tomato paste. Now you're good to go.
Heat your frying pan (don't use non-stick) briefly over medium heat. Add the oil. It's ready when the oil just starts to shimmer. You may notice I'm using less oil that usual. That's because there's some in the paste as well.
Add the Kashmiri chilies and cook for about 10 seconds. Flip them and cook another 10 seconds. You should see little bubbles form around the chili. You want it toasted. Not burned. Be careful.
Turn down the heat and add the combined spice mix, kashmiri chili powder, kasoor methi and salt. This is the critical step. Stir it constantly for 30 seconds. If it starts to darken lift the pan off the heat. You want the spice mix to cook in the oil but not burn. If your spices burn start again. It can't be saved.
Add the vindaloo paste. Fry, stirring constantly, until it starts to darken. This should take about 2 to 3 minutes.
Turn the heat up to medium high. This is important. The Maillard reaction makes this work. Google Maillard if you don't know what I'm talking about. It gives curry it's Indian restaurant flavour. Add the diluted tomato paste and stir until bubbles form. This takes around 30 seconds to one minute depending on the heat.
Add 3 oz of curry base. Stir until bubbles form, around 60 seconds. It's like a lively boil except the curry base is frying in the oil.
Now add 6 oz of curry base and stir briefly. Let it cook until the bubbles form again. Let it cook about 2 minutes.
Add the rest of the curry base and let cook until the bubbles form. Stir in the tamarind paste, sugar and worcestershire sauce. Turn the heat down to low and add the pre-cooked lamb.

Cook the potatoes in salted water until just barely done. They will cook a little longer in the curry. Reserve one cup of the cooking water. Set the potatoes aside.

Combine the turmeric, chili powder, cumin, coriander, salt, granulated garlic powder, ginger powder and paprika in a small bowl. This is your spice mix.
Toss the wings in enough oil to coat. You don't need to drown them but you do need enough to coat.
Sprinkle the wings with the spice mix and toss.
Prepare your grill for medium-high indirect heat. As always, I prefer charcoal for the flavour.
Grill the wings for 10 minutes then flip the wings. Cook the wings for about another 10 minutes. They should be crispy but not dry so be careful not to overcook them.
If you want some grill marks or char, cook them quickly over direct heat to finish. Don't try to cook them over direct heat all at once. That's a good way to end up with burned wings. 5-6 at a time is a good pace.
Drizzle them with fresh squeezed lime juice (this is key for everything to come together) and serve with tamarind dipping sauce if you want.

Bring enough water to cover the cauliflower to a boil. Add some salt. Like you were making pasta. Cook the cauliflower for 3-4 minutes. You want it just barely tender. Remove from the water and set aside to cool.
Make the batter
Combine all the batter ingredients except the water. Stir to mix thoroughly.
Add 3/4 cup water and mix to create a smooth batter. I like the batter a little thin so I add a couple extra tablespoons of water. You want the cauliflower coated with batter. You don't want them to turn out like sweet and sour chicken balls in a bad Chinese restaurant. All batter and no filling is not good.
Make the sauce
Pre-heat a frying pan over medium high heat. Add the oil, red pepper and onion. Fry aggressively. You want the peppers to blister a bit if you can. This is taking a page out of the jalfrezi playbook. A little bit smoky taste adds a nice touch. You are cooking them until the peppers are soft and the onions start to char a bit. Add the green chilies towards the end. Maybe the last minute or so.
Turn the heat down to medium and add the garlic ginger paste. Stir until it stops spluttering - about 30 seconds.
Mix in the soy, rice wine vinegar and chili sauce. Stir to combine. Add 1/4 cup water (not the water with the cornstarch) and bring to a simmer.
At this point you need to decide how sticky you want the sauce. I usually add about a tablespoon of the cornstarch water mix. That works out to a little less than a teaspoon of cornstarch. If you want really thick and gloppy add more.
Add about a tablespoon of the cornstarch mixture. Bring to a simmer. Now decide if that works for you. If not add a bit more. Do not add it all. You will make glue.
Taste your sauce for salt. It probably needs about 1/4 tsp.
Get ready to deep fry
Heat enough oil to deep fry (about 3 inches deep) in a large pot. A dutch oven works well. Pre-heat the oil to 335-350F. Use a candy/frying thermometer.
Cook the cauliflower
Mix the cauliflower with the batter. Be gentle. Add about half the cauliflower to the oil. Regulate the heat to try to keep it around 325-350F.
The cauliflower is done before it goes into the oil so you are really just cooking the batter. Remove the cauliflower when it gets golden brown. Place it on a wire rack on a cookie sheet.
Repeat with the other half of the battered cauliflower.
At this point stop and taste one of the fritters. Decide if you just want to stop here next time. Serve it up with a little tamarind chutney. I really like this for an appetizer.
Finish it off
Re-heat your sauce. Add the cauliflower fritters and toss to combine.

Heat a small skillet over medium low heat. Add the cinnamon bark, star anise, and black cardamom. Toast until just starting to get fragrant. You will smell cinnamon.
Add the fennel seed, black peppercorn, cumin seed, and cloves. Toast another 30 seconds or so.
Let cool. Transfer the whole spices along with the mace, pomegranate seed and Indian bay leaves to a spice grinder. You will need to break up the bay leaves to get them to fit. Grind to a powder.
Add the kashmiri chili powder, coriander powder, ginger powder and nutmeg powder and stir to combine. This is your nihari masala.
make the nihari gosht
Pre-heat your oven to 325F.
Heat 6 tbsp of the oil in a dutch oven large enough to hold all the ingredients (or 4 tbsp ghee and 2 tbsp oil) over medium low heat.
Add the sliced onion and cook, stirring regularly, until the onion starts to brown. You may need to adjust your heat up a bit.
Once the onion has started to brown turn the heat back to medium low if necessary. Add the whole spices and cook for about 30 seconds.
Now add the nihari masala and salt and stir to combine. You want the spices coated in fat. If it looks dry add a bit more oil or ghee. Cook, stirring constantly, for about about a minute. Watch carefully. You don't want your spices to burn.
Add the beef and stir to combine. Cook the beef, stirring occasionally, until you no longer see any red. Be careful. You still don't want your spices to burn. If the spices start to stick you may need to add the remaining oil/ghee to make this work. I usually do.
Add half the yoghurt. Stir to combine and cook for about a minute. Add the rest of the yoghurt and repeat.
Add the water and the marrow bones if you can get them. Bring to a simmer. Cover the pot with a sheet of aluminium foil and then the lid. This acts similar to a flour dum. Another French trick.
Place in the 325F oven and cook. Give it a stir every hour. Cook until tender. This should take 2 to 2 1/2 hours. There's no hard and fast rule. It's done when it's tender. That depends on how close your oven is to mine. It depends on the size of the beef. And it depends on the beef. So nobody can tell you for sure. It's done when it's done I'm afraid.
When the beef is tender remove the dutch oven from the oven. Set on the stove. Give it a few minutes to stop simmering. There should be a good layer of bright red fat floating on the surface. That stuff is gold.
Skim off as much fat as you want to remove. Remember that fat has all sorts of wonderful flavours in it so don't go overboard. A little fat is good. If you are going to remove the bones now is the time to do it. But please don't think bones are a bad thing. Leaving them in is good too. Up to you.
Transfer 4 tablespoons of the fat to a small saucepan over medium low heat. Add 3 tablepoons of whole wheat flour. Stir to get all the flour coated in the fat. Cook the fat flour mixture for about 90 seconds, stirring constantly.
Add about a tablespoon of liquid from the nihari pot and stir to combine. It will turn into this thick paste. Don't panic. Do it again. And again. And again. After the 4th time add a bit more at a time. Maybe 2 tablespoons or so. Stir until it all comes together. Do that again. And again.
Now add around a 1/2 cup. Stir to combine. Finally add around a cup. Stir until it's a nice even texture. It should have the consistency of a fairly thick gravy at this point. Add this mixture into the nihari and stir to combine. Bring to a gentle simmer. If it seems a bit thicker than you would like add a bit of water. Up to a cup or so.
Taste at this point and adjust salt. It will need a bit more but not alot so be careful and creep up on it.
Add most of the julienned ginger. Keep a bit back for garnish.
To serve, spoon into bowls and garnish with a cilantro and a little bit of julienned ginger. Serve with an Indian flatbread. I like chapatis with nihari but naan works as well. Parathas are always good but the combination of parathas with nihari is pretty rich.

Combine tandoori marinade with chicken. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 12 hours.
Add the lemon juice right before you light the grill.
Light your grill. Build a two zone fire if using charcoal. Turn your gas grill to max on all the burners except one. You want high, indirect heat. If you can get your grill over 500F that's perfect.
If you have a kamodo grill experiment with higher temperatures. I'm not saying go to 800F and walk away though. The hotter the grill, the more you have to pay attention. Gets pretty tricky above 600F.
Different chicken pieces cook at different rates. Keep that in mind. Start your thighs first. Breasts and drumsticks next. Wings last. And don't just check one piece with your thermometer. Move it around. And pull your chicken pieces when they are ready. Perfect tandoori chicken means all the pieces are cooked perfectly.
Grill the chicken over indirect heat until almost done - around 20-25 minutes. This depends on how hot your grill is so use your instant read thermometer and cook to about 155F. Always use an instant read thermometer.

Quarter each eggplant along the long axis (think potato wedge fries)
Toss with a little vegetable oil and salt.
Place on a baking sheet, skin side down and roast about 20 minutes.
At this point the skin will be really tough. Transfer the hot, roasted eggplant to a tupperware and cover. Let sit on the counter for about 15 minutes. Tender skin.
Make the nut paste
This is actually easier with a mortar and pestle. You will fight hard using a mini food processor unless you make lots.
Combine the roasted peanuts and sesame seeds in your mortar and pestle. Beat on them to break them down. Add about 3 or 4 tablespoons of water and keep working them until you get something that looks like porridge but is semi-creamy. It won't be perfectly smooth like peanut butter but don't worry about it.

Make the spice mix. Combine all the spice mix ingredients in a small bowl.
Dilute the tomato paste with the water.
Cook the potatoes. Combine the potatoes, turmeric and salt along with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil. Simmer until you can just push a fork into the potato without resistance. Be gentle. You don't want to break them up.
Have everything ready to go. Onions chopped. Garlic ginger paste standing by. Curry base pre-heated. Ingredients at hand. Be ready. It's going to go fast from here.
Make the Bombay potatoes
Heat the oil in a medium skillet over medium low heat .
Add the potatoes to the hot oil and fry until they just start to colour. This firms them up so they don't self destruct when you make the curry.
Remove the potatoes and set aside. Add the onions and cook over gentle heat until translucent. You are trying to keep them from browning. I know - anti-Indian cooking but this time that's what you want.
When the onions are translucent, raise the heat to medium. Add the mustard seed and cook around 20 seconds.
Add the garlic ginger paste. Cook until it stops sputtering, around a minute.
Turn down the heat and add the spice mix. This is the critical step. Stir it constantly for 30 seconds. If it starts to darken lift the pan off the heat. You want the spice mix to cook in the oil but not burn.
Turn the heat up to medium high. This is important. The heat is what caramelizes the onion in the curry base and gives the curry it's Indian restaurant flavour. As you become more comfortable with this technique try pushing it. Add the diluted tomato paste and stir until bubbles form (the oil will likely separate). This takes around 30 seconds to one minute depending on the heat.
Add 3 oz of curry base. Stir until bubbles form (little craters really), around 30 seconds. Think lively boil. Watch the edges of the pan. The curry can stick here. Sticking is OK. Just scrape it back into the base. Burning is bad.
Now add the remaining curry base and stir briefly. Let it cook until the bubbles form again. This takes 1-2 minutes.
Turn the heat down to low. Add the potatoes. Cook until the potatoes are warmed through and the sauce thickens. This takes about 3 minutes.
Add the chopped tomatoes and amchoor (or lemon if you aren't using amchoor). Stir to combine. Cook for another minute or two.
Garnish with a bit of chopped fresh cilantro and green chili if you like. Serve.

Make your spice mix. Dice your chilies. Prep your chicken.
Always good to have everything ready to go when you are cooking Indian restaurant or hotel style.
Make the hariyali chicken curry
Heat the oil in a medium sized frying pan until the oil just starts to shimmer.
Stir in the garlic ginger paste. Gently fry until the garlic ginger paste stops sputtering. This is the only messy step.
Add the green chilies. Cook another minute or so, stirring constantly (think stir fry).
Turn your heat down to medium low and add your spice mix. Cook for about 30 seconds. You really want to fry your spices in the oil. Don't skimp on the oil. Bad things happen if the spices stick and burn.
Add the Indian hotel curry gravy. Stir it really well to get the oil to combine with the curry gravy. You want everything mixed together at this point. Bring to a simmer.
Mix in the mint coriander chutney. Stir to combine.
Add the chicken thigh pieces in a single layer. Nestle them down into the sauce. Cover and ccok about 5 minutes. Remove the cover, flip the chicken and recover. Cook until the chicken is done. Use an instant read thermometer if you have one. You are shooting for an internal temperature of 170F.
The chicken will have thown it's wonderful juices at this point. You have to decide if you like the consistency at this point. If you would like it a bit runnier add a couple tablespoons of water and stir.

Transfer the chicken mixture to soup pot and stir it in. Simmer 3 minutes. Add lemon juice. Let it simmer another 2 minutes.
It will probably be too thick at this point. Thin it out with some stock. You want a texture somewhere around a full-bodied cream of soup.

Turn your heat down to medium low and add your spice mix. This is why you added 3 tablespoons of oil. You want to fry your spices in the oil. If you skimp on the oil you risk your spices sticking or burning. If your spices burn here you are starting over. Cook the spices for about 30 seconds.
Add the Indian hotel curry gravy. Stir it really well to get the oil to combine with the curry gravy. You want everything mixed together at this point. Bring to a simmer.
Cover loosely and cook for about 5 minutes.
Add 1/2 tsp of naga chili pickle and the coconut milk and stir. Taste. Decide if you want more naga pickle flavour and heat. Creep up on it. I love the taste of naga pickle but it does get pretty spicy fast so be careful.
Decide at this point whether you want the sugar or not. It's optional and it depends whether you like that little hint of sweetness in the background.
Add the naga chicken tikka. Continue to cook for about 1 minute to warm the chicken through.

chicken masala
In a small bowl, combine the indian restaurant mix powder, turmeric, Kashmiri chili powder, cumin, kasoor methi and salt. This is your spice mix. It goes in after the garlic ginger paste.
Heat 4 tbsp vegetable oil in a pot over medium heat until it shimmers.
Toss in the cinnamon bark and green cardamom. Let cook about 20 seconds. You will see little bubbles forming around the bark.

Turn the heat to medium low. Add the spice mix. That's the mix you made above and put in the small bowl - not just the Indian restaurant spice mix. Stir continuously until it starts to smell really good. This takes around 30-40 seconds. Watch it carefully. If you burn the spices at this point you have to start over. This is called blooming the spices. It is one of the secrets to Indian cooking.
Add the diluted tomato paste and stir to combine. Turn the heat up to medium. Cook for 1 minute.
Add half the onion paste and turn the heat up to medium high. Stir to combine. Cook for about a minute. Add the rest of the onion paste and stir again. Cook, stirring occasionally for about 4 minutes. Don't worry if it looks dry. The chicken will release juices as it cooks. Instant delicious.
Turn the heat down to medium low. Add the chicken and stir. Cover and simmer until the chicken is done. It's done when you measure the internal temperature and it says 170F, about 12-15 minutes. An instant read thermometer is a handy thing to have here...

Bring to a boil and then reduce heat to a simmer. Give the chicken a bit of a stir. You don't want pieces clumping up, preventing things from cooking evenly.

Add the garlic and green chilies and cook until the garlic just starts to turn golden.
Add the garlic ginger paste. Cook it, stirring constantly, until it stops sputtering.
Turn down the heat to medium low and add the spice mix you prepared above. This is a critical step so really pay attention here. Stir it constantly for about 30 seconds. If it starts to darken lift the pan off the heat. You want the spice mix to cook in the oil but not burn.
Turn the heat up to medium high. Add the diluted tomato paste and stir until bubbles form (the oil will likely separate). This takes around 30 seconds to one minute depending on the heat.
Add the cilantro leaves and stems. Cook for around 15-20 seconds.

Now add 6 oz of curry base and stir briefly. Let it cook until the bubbles form again. This takes 1-2 minutes.
Add the rest of the curry base and let cook until the bubbles form again. Turn the heat down to low, add the garlic pickle and then the pre-cooked chicken.

Slice your onion thinly. Really thinly. Cut it in half lengthwise. Set a half down on your cutting board. Cut off the stem end but leave the root end . Slice across the onion so you get half moon rings. Once you are done slicing the first half cut the onion slices in half to form quarter rings. Repeat the whole process with the other half onion.
Deflame the onion. Takes the bite out of it. Put the sliced onion in a fine mesh strainer. Rinse under cold water for about a minute. Transfer the onion to a bowl of cold water. Let the onions soak in the fridge for 10 minutes. Drain. You can do this when you are making salsa as well. Smooths all the rough edges of the onion. This is a good restaurant trick for anything with raw onions.
Combine the ketchup, cumin seed, masala chili sauce, salt and amchoor powder. Stir to combine. If you taste it now it will seem pretty spicy. Depending on the chili masala sauce you pick of course. Don't worry. The onions will dilute the heat. And papadum seem to soak up the fire. If anything it could be spicier if that's what you like.
Fold in the onions. Mix thoroughly to coat the onions with the tomato mixture. If you have time refrigerate the red onion chutney for about an hour to mellow the flavours. It's good right away. It's a little better after it sits for a while. Taste it right before you are ready to serve and adjust the salt.
Easy mint raita
Combine all the ingredients except the milk in a small bowl. Stir it up. Now decide if you like the texture.
If you want it thinner add some milk, a teaspoon at a time, until you get to your desired consistency. Taste and adjust salt.
How to cook papadum
Have your red onion chutney and mint raita ready to go before you start cooking papadum. Papadum do not taste good once they cool too much. They are great hot. They are not great cold. Trust me on this one. Nobody will like cold papadum.
Pick a skillet a little bigger than the papadum. 10 inch diameter is about perfect. Bigger is OK but it takes more oil.
A good set of tongs is essential here. Have them ready when you start cooking.
Pour enough oil into your pan to get it about 1/2 inch deep. Heat your oil to around 350F. Use a thermometer. Guessing never works well. If you must guess you want your papadum to cook in about 8-10 seconds and not wind up too brown. Thermometers are way easier. Better food through science.
Have a plate with some paper towel on it nearby. You are going to need to have it close to the pan or you are going to drip oil everywhere.
Slip a papadum into the oil. It will start to curl and cook immediately. After around 4-5 seconds grab it with your tongs and flip it. It will be pretty solid so this should be easy. Cook another 3-5 seconds. Grab one edge of the papadum and hold it vertically above the oil to drain a bit.
Transfer the cooked papadum to the plate with the tongs. I like to have my tongs in my dominant hand and the plate in my other hand when I do this.
Repeat no more than 6 times. Don't serve cold papdum. Just don't do it. Have I mentioned that?
Serve the papadum with the red onion chutney and mint raita. Let your guests decide what they want to put on their papadum.",en-US,{},5.0,,glebe kitchen,30,6 serving(s)

Make the chicken bhuna
Heat the oil in a pot with a lid that is large enough to hold all the ingredients over medium heat. When the oil starts to shimmer add the onions.
Cook the onions until they are browned on the edges. You aren't going for the deep brown onions this time. This should take 10 to 15 minutes.

Push the onions to one side. Give them a squeeze with a wooden spoon or spatula to get the oil into the pan. Add the whole spices and cook until you see little bubbles forming around the spices.
Pay attention to this step. Turn the heat to medium low. Add the powdered spice mix. Stir to combine thoroughly with the oil. You are going for a spicy oil slurry. You should have enough oil but if it looks dry add another tablespoon.
Cook the powdered spices for about a minute, stirring regularly. You need to be careful here. If you have enough oil the spices shouldn't burn. Burnt spices is the kiss of death. You have to start over if you burn them. If you have any doubts just push the pot off the burner.
Now stir the spice slurry into the onions. Mix it all up. Cook for about a minute more.
Add the pureed tomatoes. Stir to combine. Reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for about 10 minutes.
Add the chicken. Give it a stir and bring to a lively simmer. Cover loosely, reduce heat to get a gentle simmer and cook, stirring occasionally until the chicken is cooked through. Chicken thighs are perfectly cooked at 170F. Use your instant read thermometer. You have an instant read thermometer right? If you don't, you are just guessing.
The chicken should be done in 20-25 minutes. Keep an eye on it. Give it a gentle stir every 5 minutes or so. You want this to be a pretty dry curry. The chicken will throw liquid as it cooks. If it looks really saucy take the lid off completely to finish cooking.

Pre-heat your oven to 350 degrees
Remove the stem from the Indian eggplant. Cut each eggplant into 4 wedges lengthwise. Think of cutting an egg in half for deviled eggs and then half again. Cut it that way.
Toss the eggplant in a little vegetable oil. You don't want to drown it but make sure every piece is coated.
Place on a cookie sheet or pizza pan, skin side down. Sprinkle with salt.
Roast in the oven until the eggplant is soft and just starting to colour. This should take about 25 minutes.
When the eggplant comes out of the oven the skin will be hard. You don't want that. Place the hot eggplant in a small tupperware and cover. Set aside on the counter for 30 minutes. The skin will soften.
Make the baingan masala
Pick a skillet that can take heat. Something with an insulated handle is good. Put on some shabby clothes. Cooking Indian restaurant style is messy stuff.
Place the skillet over medium low heat.
Add 3 Tbsp of oil. When it starts to shimmer add the onions and cook until the edges of the onions start to colour. This should take 3-4 minutes. Add the cumin seed and green chilies and cook another 30 seconds or so.
Move the onions to one side. There should be a fair bit of oil in the bottom of the pan. Add the spice mix and stir to thoroughly coat the spices in oil. It should start to bubble a bit. Cook the spices for about 30 seconds. Watch your pan carefully. You don't want to let your spices burn.
Add the garlic ginger paste and chopped cilantro stems and stir the spices, garlic ginger paste and onions to combine. Cook about 30-45 seconds.
Turn the heat up to medium high. Add 3 oz of curry base. Stir to combine. Let cook about a minute. You should see craters forming and a bit of oil separating out.

Turn the heat up to medium high. This is important. The heat is what makes the curry base do its magic. Gives the curry it's Indian restaurant flavour.

Make the seekh kebabs
Light your grill. You want to grill over medium high direct heat. But you also want to leave yourself a cooler zone. For charcoal bank your fire on one side. For gas simply leave an element on low with the rest on medium high.
Prep your dipping sauce. Combine the mint coriander chutney with the yoghurt and stir to combine. Set aside.
Wet your hands. Grab a large golf ball worth of seekh kebab mixture. Roll it into a ball. Pass the skewer through the center of the ball. Now spread it out along the skewer. You are making little lamb tubes here. If the first couple don't quite work out just pull the lamb off and start again. You will get the hang of it.
Once you have skewered all the meat, transfer the kebabs to the grill. It's never a bad idea to give yourself a little insulation over the exposed wood portion of the skewers. A little strip of tin foil can make the difference between burned skewer stumps and useful skewers.
Grill, turning every couple minutes until the lamb is cooked through. You want an internal temperature of 160F. I know that is high but in the case of ground meat you need to be careful. Sucks. I know. Safety first.

Make your spice mix. Cut up your green chilies, onion, green pepper and tomatoes. Make your naga chicken tikka - or whatever chicken tikka you prefer. Have everything ready.
DIlute your curry gravy with 1/4 cup (4 tbsp) of chicken stock. You need to dilute it because the chicken is going in pre-cooked.
Make your quick naga chicken tikka
Combine the tandoori masala, kasoor methi, salt (if necessary), naga pickle and oil in a bowl large enough to hold all the chicken. This is your chicken marinade. It does not go into the final curry.
Add the chicken and combine with the marinade. Use tongs. This stuff will stain your fingers.
Marinate for about an hour. Pre-heat your oven to 400F while this is going on. Place a sturdy baking sheet in the oven to pre-heat.
Transfer the chicken (again, use tongs) to that pre-heated, sturdy but not too large baking sheet (can you tell the pre-heated pan is important?). Place in the oven. Cook for about 6 minutes. Flip all the pieces and return to the oven.
Cook until the internal temperature of the chicken reaches 165F. This should take another 4-8 minutes or so. Really depends on how big your chicken thigh pieces are. Remove the chicken from the baking sheet. Set aside.
You have a bit extra so snack on a piece or two if you must. I know I can never resist so I added an extra thigh to the recipe. Enjoy. Guilt free. If you aren't hungry they can go into the curry. Fine either way.
Make the chicken tikka jalfrezi
Heat the oil in a medium sized frying pan until the oil just starts to shimmer.
Add the onions and green peppers and stir every few seconds. Keep the peppers skin side down as much as you can. Fry until the pepper starts to blister and the onion edges turn brown.
Stir in the garlic ginger paste. Cook until the garlic ginger paste stops sputtering.
Turn your heat down to medium low and add your spice mix. This is why you need to use all the oil. You want to fry your spices. Too little oil and you risk your spices sticking or burning. Nothing you can do will fix burned spices.
It might look a little dry after frying the onions and peppers. You want the spices in oil. Not a dry paste. If it does look dry add a spash of oil immediately. Cook your spices for about 30 seconds.
Add the Indian hotel curry gravy. Stir it really well to get the oil to combine with the curry gravy. You want everything mixed together at this point. Bring to a simmer.
Cover loosely and cook for about 5 minutes.
Add the chicken tikka and the green chilies. Continue to cook for about 2 minutes to warm the chicken through. Add the tomatoes and cook another minute or so. At this point your sauce is going to be a little thick. Stir in a tablespoon or two of chicken stock or water to get the consistency you want. As much liquid as you need. This step is feel.
Taste. You have a decision to make. A 1/4 tsp of naga pickle mixed in at this point is a nice touch. It kicks the heat up though but it does add a distinctive flavour you can't get any other way. I like it both ways. Depends on my mood. The more classic jalfrezi leaves it out. Up to you.

Make the rice
Want perfect rice every time? Get a rice cooker. I don't like one trick kitchen appliances as a rule but I love my rice cooker. Something to think about...
If you have a rice cooker use it. Just combine the rice ingredients and proceed as you normally do. While the rice is cooking cook the chicken.
If you don't have a rice cooker this is an easy way to make basmati. You can pre-soak, rinse or whatever you want but this works pretty well as written. Blasphemy. I know. But it works. I did this for years until I got a rice cooker.
Pick a pan with a fairly tight fitting lid that's not way too big. Combine the water, chicken stock, green cardamom, cloves, cinnamon stick, salt and the rice in a saucepan.
Bring to a simmer over medium heat uncovered. Reduce heat to low and cover. Simmer for 20 minutes. Set a timer. Seriously. While this is going on make the chicken (see below).
When the timer goes off after 20 minutes, turn off the heat and let stand an additional 5 minutes. Uncover. Remove the whole spices. They should be just sitting on top. Party trick. Fluff gently and replace the cover to keep the rice warm.
Make the chicken
Make the biryani spice mix. Just combine all the ingredients in a small bowl. Dilute the tomato paste. Slice your shallots. Have everything at hand.
Heat the oil in a saute pan over medium heat. Add the shallots and cook until they start to brown. They will brown some more in the next couple steps.
Add the cumin seed. Cook for about 30 seconds.
Add the garlic ginger paste. Stir it into the oil and cook until it stops sputtering. Watch it. Don't let it burn.
Turn the heat to medium low. Add the spice mix. Stir to thoroughly combine the oil in the pan with the spices. Cook for about 30 seconds. Really watch it. There should be enough oil in the pan. If the spices start to stick turn down the heat and add a bit more oil.
Add the diluted tomato paste, stir and turn the heat up to medium. Cook about a minute.
Add the chicken and cook, stirring regularly until the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 150F. You want it mostly cooked. This It will finish cooking in the biryani.
Assemble the biryani
Use a pot that's about 9-10 inches in diameter. Make sure it has a pretty tight fitting lid.
Put a little more than half the rice in the pot and spread it out in an even layer. Top with the chicken. Add the rest of the rice. Top with the fried onions.
If you are using it, dissolve the saffron in a little water. Drizzle this over the top layer of rice.
Cover the pot with tinfoil and then the lid. The tinfoil adds a little extra seal. It's not quite as good as the dough seal in a traditional biryani but it will work well enough.
Transfer the biryani to the oven and bake for 15 minutes.
After the biryani has baked for 15 minutes remove it from the oven and place it on the stove. Let stand for 10 minutes.
To serve transfer the contents to a platter. It will get a bit messy. That's OK. The mix will look good, especially once you garnish it. It should look just like the pictures because that's exactly what I did.
Garnish with more fried shallots and a bit of cilantro.

Heat your frying pan (don't use non-stick) briefly over medium low heat. Add the oil and then 1 tsp tandoori masala.

Place the 2 cups of chopped onions in a microwave safe dish and cover loosely. Microwave at 70 percent until the onions are soft and translucent. This takes 10 minutes in my 1100 watt microwave. I can't predict how long it will take in yours...
Remove the onions from the microwave. Be careful. They will be hot. Let them cool slightly. Place the onions, 2 tbsp vegetable oil and 1 cup of warm water in a blender and puree until smooth. Set aside.
Chicken jalfrezi
In a small bowl, combine the mix powder, tandoori masala, Kashmiri chili powder, kasoor methi and salt. This is your spice mix.

Add the green pepper, skin side down. Cook for about 2 minutes. Add the remaining chopped onion and continue to cook until the onion starts to brown on the edges and the green pepper scorches a bit. You really want the colour on the green pepper skin. It's key to the taste of a jalfrezi.
Add the garlic ginger paste and cilantro stems and cook until the garlic ginger paste stops spluttering.
Turn the heat to medium low. Add the spice mix and stir continuously until it starts to smell really good - around 30-40 seconds. Watch it carefully. If you burn the spices at this point you have to start over. It will stick a bit. That's OK - you will deglaze with the tomato mixture.
Add the diluted tomato paste and stir to combine. Turn the heat up to medium. Cook for 1 minute, scraping up any spice mix that stuck to the pan..
Add the onion paste and turn the heat up to medium high. Cook, stirring occasionally for about 4 minutes. It will darken a bit as it cooks. Don't worry if it seems a bit dry. The chicken will release juices as it cooks and you should be left with a nice amount of sauce.
Turn the heat down to medium low. Add the chicken and green chilies and stir. Cover and simmer until the chicken is done. It's done when you measure the internal temperature and it says 170F, about 12-15 minutes. An instant read thermometer is a handy thing to have here...
If the curry is a bit thick add a bit of water or chicken stock and stir. Add the cherry tomatoes. Let the chicken jalfrezi simmer another minute or so. Taste for salt and adjust as needed. It may be a bit under salted at this point.

Do yourself a favour and use a food processor if you have one. Peel and half the onions. Cut each half into six pieces. Fill your food processor about 2/3 full and pulse around 5-8 times. You should have diced onions. Repeat until you have chopped all the onions.
As long as your food processor is out use it to chop the tomatoes (if using fresh). Easy.
Heat the oil in a pot large enough to hold all the ingredients.
Add the oil and heat over medium heat.
Once the oil starts to shimmer add the cardamom, black peppercorns, cloves, cinnamon and optional Indian bay leaf.

Measure out your spices. Prep your chicken. Measure out a cup (237 ml) of Indian hotel curry gravy.
Remove the fresh methi leaves from the stems. Discard the stems. You want 1/2 cup of loosely packed methi leaves.
Make the methi chicken curry
Heat the oil in a medium sized frying pan over medium heat until the oil just starts to shimmer.
Add the cumin seeds. You want the oil hot enough that little bubbles form but not so hot you burn your cumin seeds. If it's too hot lift the pan from the heat and hope you were fast enough.
Stir in the garlic ginger paste. Gently fry until the garlic ginger paste stops sputtering. This can get a little messy.
Turn your heat down to medium low and add your spice mix. Cook for about 30 seconds. You want to fry your spices in the oil. Don't skimp on the oil. Bad things happen if the spices stick and burn. You cannot fix burned spices. Just start over if that happens.
Add the Indian hotel curry gravy. Stir it really well to get the oil to combine with the curry gravy. You want everything mixed together at this point. Bring to a simmer.
Stir in the fresh methi leaves.
Add the chicken thigh pieces in a single layer. Nestle them down into the sauce. Cover and ccok about 5 minutes. Remove the cover, flip the chicken and recover. Cook until the chicken is done. Use an instant read thermometer if you have one. You are shooting for an internal temperature of 160F. It will get to 170F as the curry finishes cooking.

If you are happy with it, cover and simmer for 2 minutes. If it's still too thick, add a bit more stock. I've never added more than a 1/4 cup.

Dice the onions. Rinse the chickpeas. Measure out your spices - whole in one dish, dried in another.
Make the green chili chana achari
Preheat your pan over medium heat. Add the oil to a pan large enough to hold all the ingredients.
When the oil starts to shimmer add the diced onion. Cook until lightly brown.
Add the garlic ginger paste. Cook until it stops sputtering - about 30 seconds.
Push the onion mixture to one side. You should have a puddle of oil in the pan. If you don't add a splash. You need this to cook the spices.
Turn down the heat to medium low. Add the whole spices, the curry leaf and the fresh green chilies. Cook for around 30 seconds.
Now add in the powdered spices. Stir those into the oil. You want them well coated in oil so they bloom. If it looks like the powdered will stick add a bit more oil. This is important. Cook for around 30-45 seconds.
Toss in the chickpeas and the water or stock and bring to a simmer. Cook, covered, for as long as it takes to get creamy chickpeas and a little body in the sauce. This will vary with the brand of chickpea. Somewhere between 20 and 60 minutes. Keep an eye on the water level. Add more as required. In the end you want your sauce to have a bit of texture so don't drown the chickpeas. You are going for around half the liquid volume you started with.
This is the part that's up to you. It's hard to predict how much green chili pickle flavour you will want. Remember you haven't added any salt yet so everything will taste a bit flat. There's salt in pickle and I don't know how much there is in the brand you picked.
Add 2-3 tsps of green chili pickle. Stir and taste. If you think it could use more taste add another tsp. Repeat until you get a flavour profile that works for you. I use 6 tsps for the brand I use (Mother's).
Now taste for salt and adjust accordingly. I used 1/2 tsp but the chickpeas were pretty lightly seasoned. You may not need any more salt.

Seed and stem the dried ashmiri chilies. Just break them in half and give them a shake. A few seeds won't kill you.
Place the chilies in hot tap water and soak until rehydrated. This takes about 30 minutes.
Combine the rehydrated chilies along with the rest of the paste ingredients in a blender or food processor. Add a bit of water. Puree. Keep adding water until a paste forms. Really have at it. The skins from the chilies are pretty hard to break down.
Marinate the lamb
Combine the lamb, garam masala, yoghurt and salt. Mix. Cover and refrigerate for one hour.
Make the laal maas
Pre-heat your oven to 325F.
Pre-heat a dutch oven large enough to hold all the ingredients over medium heat. Add 4 tbsp of oil.
Add the black and green cardamom and cook for 20-30 seconds.
Add the onions and cook until they are well browned. Regulate the heat to prevent burning. Stir them often.
Push the onions to the side around the edges of the pot. Add the remaining two tbsp oil to the middle of the pot. Pour in the laal maas curry paste and fry until it darkens. This takes a couple minutes. Stir constantly and regulate the heat to avoid the paste burning. Watch your onions.
Once the curry paste has darkened slightly mix it in with the onions. Add the tomato paste. Cook the onion/paste mixture over medium low heat for 4-5 minutes.
Add the lamb and marinade. Stir to mix everything together. Cook about 5 minutes over medium low heat. Don't forget to give it stir every minute or so.
Add one cup of water. Stir to combine.
Cover and place the dutch oven in the 325F oven. Cook until the lamb is tender. This takes somewhere around 90 minutes to 2 hours. It depends on the size of the chunks. It's ready when it's ready.
Remove the pot from the oven. If the curry is a little thin simmer uncovered until you get the consistency you want. Spoon off the excess oil. But remember, there is flavour in that oil so leaving a bit behind is not the worst thing you can do...

Pre-heat a small skillet over medium-low heat.
Measure out all the large spices (coriander seed, cinnamon bark, peppercorns, star anise arms, clove and green cardamon. Put those in one small bowl. These are the ""big"" spices. Measure out the cumin seed, poppy seed and ajwain into another bowl. These are the ""little spices"". Very scientific. I know.
Add the ""big"" spices. Toast, shaking the pan, until they start to get fragrant. This should take a minute or two.
Add the ""little"" spices and chilies and toast, shaking constantly, for another minute. Flip the chilies about half way through.
Let cool and grind to a fine powder. I like a coffee grinder for this. One of those ones with the blade.
Do your prep
Chop the onion. Measure out your spice mix (everything can go into one of the little bowls you used above). Grab your curry leaves. Prep your chicken. Measure out a cup (237 ml) of Indian hotel curry gravy.

Make the chettinad chicken curry
Heat the oil in a medium sized frying pan until the oil just starts to shimmer.
Add the cassia bark. You should see little bubbles forming around it. Cook for about 30 seconds.
Add the onions. Cook the onions until they are fully translucent. If you can get the edges to brown a bit that's a good thing.
Stir in the garlic ginger paste. Gently fry until the garlic ginger paste stops sputtering. This is the only messy step.
Turn your heat down to medium low and add your spice mix and the curry leaves. Cook for about 30 seconds. You really want to fry your spices in the oil. Don't skimp on the oil. Bad things happen if the spices stick and burn.
Add the Indian hotel curry gravy. Stir it really well to get the oil to combine with the curry gravy. You want everything mixed together at this point. Bring to a simmer.
Add the chicken thigh pieces in a single layer. Nestle them down into the sauce. Cover and ccok about 5 minutes. Remove the cover, flip the chicken and recover. Cook until the chicken is done. Use an instant read thermometer if you have one. You are shooting for an internal temperature of 160F. It will get to 170F as the curry finishes cooking.

Pre-cook your chicken. Cut the chicken into large bite size pieces. Put them in a pan with enough chicken stock or water to cover. Add a bit of spice mix or curry powder and a pinch of salt. Simmer until just barely done. The chicken cooks again briefly in the gravy.
Pre-cook your potatoes. Cut them into pieces about the same size as the chicken. Add them to a small sauce pan and cover with well salted water. Bring to a simmer. The potatoes are done when a fork slides into them easily.
Make the spice mixes. Combine the restaurant spice mix, kashmiri chili powder, cinnamon and salt in one small bowl. This is your powdered spice mix. Combine the mustard seeds and panch phoran in another small bowl.
Combine 1 1/2 tablespoons of tomato paste with about 3 tablespoons of water.
Make the Bengali chicken curry
Heat your frying pan (don't use non-stick) briefly over medium heat. Add the oil.
Once the oil starts to shimmer add the panch phoran and mustard seed mix. You should see little bubbles forming around the spices. Cook 15-20 seconds.
Now add the garlic ginger paste. Cook, stirring constantly, until it stops sputtering. This should take 30 seconds or so.
Add the powdered spice mix. This is the critical step. Stir it constantly for 30 seconds. If it starts to darken lift the pan off the heat. You want the spice mix to cook in the oil but not burn. You can go a little longer if you want. Really cook out the spices. Just be careful. Burnt spices are not tasty.
Turn the heat up to medium high. This is important. The heat is what caramelizes (maillard reaction really) the onions in the curry base and gives the curry it's Indian restaurant flavour. As you become more comfortable with this technique try pushing it. Add the diluted tomato paste and stir until bubbles form (the oil will likely separate).

Combine the lentils, water and turmeric in a pot large enough to hold the final curry. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer until the lentils are mushy. You want to bring them to a boil uncovered and then cover when you reduce to a simmer. I've had lentils boil over more times than I care to mention. Messy stuff.
Give them a stir every now and then while they cook. Sometimes they stick to the bottom a bit right when they get to the mush stage. Keep an eye on them. They will cook more with the chicken. Ultimately you want the lentils to fully disintegrate. A little thick at this stage is OK. The chicken will throw some liquid as it cooks.
Prepare the seasoning masala or tempering
Heat the oil over medium heat in a skillet. Add the cinnamon and cook until little bubbles form around it. This takes 20-30 seconds.
Now add the mustard seed, panch phoran and cumin seed. Cook until they start to sizzle. Again, this takes only a few seconds.

Soak 4 skewers in water for 30 minutes.
Prepare your grill for medium-high indirect heat. You will start your chicken on indirect heat and then move it over direct heat at the end.
Skewer 3 whole chicken thighs on two skewers set up side by side. Fold the chicken thigh in half so you have 6 layers of chicken per skewer pair.
Grill over indirect heat for about 25 minutes.
Check internal temperature after 15 minutes.
When you hit 160F start lightly charring the chicken over direct heat.
Peppers and onions
Heat the vegetable oil over medium heat.

Drain the lamb and set aside. If you want, keep the stock. It makes a great addition to any home style lamb curry.
The lamb saag

While the timer counts down prepare an ice bath. Add a bunch of ice and water to a large bowl. It will need to hold the eggs fully submerged so pick the right bowl.

Dilute the tomato paste with enough water to get to the consistency of passata.

Add 4 tbsp oil to the pan you will use to prepare your chicken dopiaza. Look at how much oil is in the pan. You will need to top it up a bit to get back to the same level when you make your dopiaza.
Add the coarsely chopped onions (big pieces). Fry until softened and edges just barely start to darken. You want them soft so don't push your pan too hard. Silky soft. A little oily. And a bit of char on the edges. That's what you want.
Use tongs to remove the onions. Set aside.

Place the onions in a microwave safe dish and cover loosely. Microwave at 70 percent until the onions are soft and translucent. This takes about 10 minutes in my 1100 watt microwave oven.
Remove the onions from the microwave. Be careful. They will be hot. Like burn you with the steam hot. Let them cool slightly.
Place the onions, 2 tbsp vegetable oil and 1 cup of warm water in a blender and puree until smooth. Set aside.
chicken and chickpea curry
In a small bowl, combine the coriander powder, cumin powder, turmeric, Kashmiri chili powder, kasoor methi and salt. This is your spice mix. It goes in after the garlic ginger paste.
Heat 4 tbsp vegetable oil in a pot over medium heat until it shimmers.
Add the garlic ginger paste. Cook until the garlic ginger paste stops spluttering.
Turn the heat to medium low. Add the spice mix. Stir continuously until it starts to smell really good. This takes around 30-40 seconds. Watch it carefully. If you burn the spices at this point you have to start over. This is called blooming the spices. It is one of the secrets to Indian cooking. Works well in Mexican cooking as well.
Add half the onion paste. Stir to combine. Cook over medium heat for about 2 minutes. It is going to splatter. Be warned.
Add the remaining onion paste. Cook another 2 minutes or so.
Turn the heat to medium low. Add the potatoes and chickpeas. Cook for around 20 minutes. The potatoes should be nearly done.
Now add the chicken and stir. Cover and simmer until the chicken is done. It's done when you measure the internal temperature and it says 170F. That takes about 12-15 minutes. An instant read thermometer is a handy thing to have here...
If the curry is a bit thick add a bit of water or chicken stock and stir. Add the diced and cilantro and lemon juice. Let the chicken masala simmer another minute or so. Taste for salt and adjust as needed.
Garnish with a bit more cilantro if desired.",en-US,"{'servingSize': '4 servings', 'calories': '634 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '45 g', 'proteinContent': '44 g', 'fatContent': '31 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '19 g', 'cholesterolContent': '161 mg', 'sodiumContent': '768 mg', 'fiberContent': '11 g', 'sugarContent': '9 g'}",5.0,,glebe kitchen,60,4 serving(s)

Dilute the tomato paste with enough water to get to the consistency of passata.
Dilute your coconut milk powder enough with water to get it to the consistency of coconut milk.
Heat your frying pan (don't use non-stick) briefly over medium heat. Add the oil.
When the oil starts to shimmer add the cinnamon stick. Toss is around the pan for about 15 seconds until bubbles start to form around it. It may crackle a bit.
Add the onions and stir constantly until the edges of the onions start to brown. This takes about a minute.
Next comes the garlic ginger paste. Add it into the pan and cook it, stirring constantly, until it stops sputtering.
Turn down the heat and add the spice mix. This is the critical step. Stir it constantly for 30 seconds. If it starts to darken lift the pan off the heat. You want the spice mix to cook in the oil but not burn.
Turn the heat up to medium high. This is important. The heat is what caramelizes the onion base and gives the curry it's Indian restaurant flavour. As you become more comfortable with this technique try pushing it. Add the diluted tomato paste and stir until bubbles form (the oil will likely separate). This takes around 30 seconds to one minute depending on the heat.
Add 3 oz of curry base. Stir until bubbles form (little craters really), around 30 seconds. Think lively boil. Watch the edges of the pan. The curry can stick here. Sticking is OK. Just scrape it back into the base. Burning is bad.
Now add 6 oz of curry base and stir briefly. Let it cook until the bubbles form again. This takes 1-2 minutes.
Add the rest of the curry base and let cook until the bubbles form. Add the lemon and diluted coconut milk powder. Turn the heat down to low and add the pre-cooked lamb, beef or chicken.
Let the curry simmer for about 5 minutes. If it gets too thick add a bit more curry base. Don't add water.

Lamb madras - Indian hotel style,romain | glebekitchen,https://glebekitchen.com/lamb-madras-indian-hotel-style/,Indian,https://glebekitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/lambmadrastopbowl-1.jpg,"['12 oz lamb (I like shoulder best. Cut into 1 to 1 1/2 inch pieces.)', '1 tsp curry powder (or mix powder if you prefer)', '1 tsp kosher salt (- you want fairly salty to season the lamb. You will be discarding the cooking liquid.)', '1 cup chicken stock (- enough to cover)', '1 tsp Indian restaurant spice mix (- recipe link below)', '2 tsp madras curry powder (- you can get this at your Indian grocer)', '1 tsp kashmiri chili powder', '1 tsp kasoor methi (- dried fenugreek leaves)', '1/2 tsp kosher salt', '3 tbsp vegetable oil', '1 2 inch cassia bark', '2 tbsp minced shallot (or red onion)', '1 tbsp garlic ginger paste (- recipe link below)', 'the spice mix from above', '1 cup Indian hotel curry gravy (- diluted with 1/4 cup of water - recipe link below. )', 'the pre-cooked lamb', '3 tbsp coconut milk', '1/3 tsp tamarind paste (- or tamarind pulp if you make it yourself.)', '1/4-1/2 tsp chili pickle']","Do your prep
Make your spice mix. Pre-cook the lamb.
DIlute your curry gravy with 1/4 cup of water (the same 1/4 as in the ingredient list - don't dilute it twice). You need to dilute it because the lamb is going in pre-cooked. That probably doesn't make sense to you if you haven't made a chicken hotel curry yet. Just do it. It will work out.
Pre-cook the lamb
Add the lamb, curry powder, salt and chicken stock to a saucepan. You want enough stock to fully cover the lamb. 1 cup is a guess. I don't know how big your sauce pan is. Try to pick one that isn't way too big.
Bring to a simmer. Cook until the lamb is tender. This should take somewhere around an hour for lamb shoulder. Depends on how big your lamb chunks are. Also depends on the lamb. You are making stew. It's done when it's done I'm afraid.
Drain. Discard the stock (it will be very salty) and set the lamb aside. You can do this the day before if you'd like.
Make the lamb madras
Heat the oil in a medium sized frying pan until the oil just starts to shimmer.
Add the cassia bark. You should see little bubbles forming around it. Cook for about 30 seconds.
Add the diced shallots. Cook until they just start to colour up.
Stir in the garlic ginger paste. Gently fry until the garlic ginger paste stops sputtering. This is the only messy step.
Turn your heat down to medium low and add your spice mix. This is why you added 3 tablespoons of oil. You really want to fry your spices in the oil. Skimp on the oil and you risk your spices sticking or worse, burning. If your spices burn here you are starting over. No way around this.
Add the Indian hotel curry gravy. Stir it really well to get the oil to combine with the curry gravy. You want everything mixed together at this point. Bring to a simmer.
Add the tamarind paste, the cconut milk and the lamb.
Cover loosely and cook for about 5 minutes.
Taste the curry. If you can take the heat, add the chili pickle. A little goes a long way but it really makes a difference in flavour too.
If the sauce looks a little thick at this point add a bit of water and bring back to a gentle simmer. Cook for another two or three minutes. You want some of the lamb flavour to infuse the sauce.
Serve with rice or Indian flatbread. I like a tarka dal or chana masala on the side.

The salad
Run the chopped white onion under cold running water for about 10 seconds. This mellows out the bite of the onion. A mesh strainer works well.
Add about 3/4 tsp of salt to the tomatoes and place in the strainer over a bowl. Let stand for about 20 minutes to let liquid drain. Use these two tricks when you make salsa. It works.

Pick a pot big enough to hold all the ingredients.
Heat the oil over medium low heat. Add the onions. Cook the onions, stirring occasionally, until they break down and turn light brown. This takes 15-20 minutes. You can't skip this step.
Push the onions over to one side. Give a squeeze against the side of the pot to get some of the oil out.
Add the whole spices. Cook for about 30-45 seconds. Now add the ground spices and stir to mix with the oil. You don't want the mix to be dry at this point. You want the spices wet. If it looks dry add another tablespoon of oil. Cook for about a minute. Be careful. Don't let your spices burn.
Add the garlic ginger paste. Stir everything together and cook, stirring regularly, for 3 minutes or so.
Add the tomatoes. Stir. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes break down. This should take 5-7 minutes.
Add the chicken stock and the potatoes. Cover and simmer (adjust your heat accordingly) for 15-20 minutes. Your potatoes should be starting to soften.

You can do this the day before. You can also make batches and freeze the lamb in 12 oz portions (cooked weight) to make curries whenever you'd like. That's what I do.
