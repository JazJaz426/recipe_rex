Pour the marinade over the chicken and refrigerate at least one hour. You can go up to 8 hours. There is no acid in the marinade so there's no issue with the chicken cooking (think ceviche). Reserve the marinade when you are done marinating the chicken. Don't throw it out. This is important.
Pre-heat your oven to 375F.
Remove the chicken from the marinade and place into a dish that can go from the oven to the stove-top. You don't want a pan that is much bigger than the chicken. A frying pan with heat resistant handles is great for this.
Roast until the internal temperature of the chicken reaches 160F. Remove the chicken from the pan and set aside.
Place the frying pan (or whatever you are using) over medium heat. When it starts to bubble stir up any browned bits in the pan. Add the reserved marinade and bring to a lively simmer. This kills any bacteria so make sure you see bubbles in the pan.
If your sauce seems dry add a little drizzle of chicken stock. You don't get a lot of sauce here. It's just a drizzle so don't go crazy.

Combine the soy, sake, mirin, sugar, garlic and green onions in a ziploc bag large enough to hold the pork belly. Stick a straw in the bag and seal the ziploc bag up against it (so the straw is the only opening). Suck as much of the air out as you can and seal.
Sous vide the pork for 10-11 hours at 170F.
Remove pork from the ziploc bag. Discard the bag and marinade.
Let the chashu pork belly cool completely.
Slice across the chashu pork (so you get bacon like slices) - into 8-12 slices about 1/8 to 3/16 inches thick. Reserve. You won't need all the pork for 4 servings.
Soy bacon tare
Combine all the ingredients in a small sauce pan. Simmer at the lowest setting for about an hour. Top up with a bit of chicken stock if needed.
Remove the bacon.
Miso tare
Combine all ingredients in a small sauce pan and simmer at the lowest setting for about 5 minutes.
Medium boiled eggs
Bring enough water to cover the eggs to a boil. If you have a way to prick the eggshell do it. Boil large eggs for 6 minutes 30 seconds. If using extra large eggs boil them for 7 minutes 30 seconds. You may have to adjust your times slightly depending on the exact size of your eggs but this should get you pretty close.
Submerge the eggs in cold or ice water to chill. This stops the egg yolks from continuing to set up. Peel. Cut in half right before you serve your tonkotsu ramen.
Assemble the tonkotsu ramen
Boil the ramen noodles in plenty of water as directed by the packaging. If there's no translation on the packaging usually its 4 minutes. You don't need to salt the water.
Cook the mushrooms along side the noodles - you just want them softened.
Gently fry the chashu pork in a non-stick skillet until lightly browned.
Place 1/4 of whichever tare you are using in the bottom of four bowls.
Ladle in about 1/2 cup of the tonkotsu broth into each of the bowls and stir to mix.
Add the noodles. Pour in another 1 1/2 cups of the tonkotsu broth per bowl.

Grill the chicken over direct medium heat skin side down for about two minutes. There is sugar in the marinade so it will burn. Watch it closely.
Flip the chicken and move it to the low side of the grill. After 10 minutes baste the chicken with the boiled marinade. Repeat this again after another 10 minutes.

Slice the onion into 1/8 inch slices. Cut the onion in half from the stem to the root. Peel. Cut the stem end off. Now cut slices moving towards the stem end. You are cutting onion half moons.
Cut up the carrots, potatoes and chicken. You want bite size pieces.
Heat a pot large enough to hold all the ingredients over medium low heat. Add 2 tablespoons of butter. Let melt and then add the onions and the salt. Cook the onions for about 5 minutes stirring occasionally. You are going for soft and translucent. You don't want to let the onions brown.
Add the carrots, garlic and ginger (or 1 tbsp of garlic ginger paste if you stock it) and cook another 2 minutes.
Add the stock. Stir and bring to a simmer. Let cook 10 minutes. Set a timer. Makes things easy.
Add the potatoes. Cook another 15 minutes. Use your timer. Check the potatoes. They should be close to done. Depends on how big the pieces were. If they aren't starting to soften cook them until they do.
Add the chicken. Cook 10 minutes.
While the chicken cooks make the curry roux.
Heat the remaining 4 tablespoons of butter in a small sauce pan over medium low heat. Add the curry powder and garam masala and cook for about 30-45 seconds. Add the flour and stir to combine. You want all the flour coated with fat. If it's really dry add a bit of vegetable oil.
Cook the flour/spice mixture over medium low heat for about 2 minutes. This is your roux.
Now add a couple tablespoons of broth from the simmering curry. Stir to combine. It will make an ungodly looking mess. Goop. Don't worry. Add another couple tablespoons of broth and stir. Repeat that a couple more times.
Now add around 1/2 cup of broth and stir to combine. Add another 1/2 cup or so and stir. You sould be getting to the point where you have a really thick but smooth paste. Curry paste. It's better than it sounds. It's actually a variant of veloute which is a variant on bechamel. There's some cooking theory in this recipe...
10-12 minutes have gone by. Check the chicken. It should be done or at least close. Depends on how lively your simmer is though. Use an instant read thermometer. Safety first. You want it read around 155-160F at this point. The thighs are cooked at 170F but you can go a little higher. That's the nice thing about dark meat. It is forgiving.
Add the curry veloute (fancy way to say the curry paste) to the curry. Stir to combine. Bring to a simmer. The chicken should be done. Check it. If it's not cook it for another few minutes.
Taste. At this point the flavour profile will be similar to the cubes. Adjust salt. Now add one tablespoon of tonkotsu sauce. Taste again. This will add a hint of sweetness as well as that secret Japanese curry flavour. If you like it stop now. If you want more fruit and sugar add another tablespoon. I like it between one and two tablespoons. If you want big fruit taste add another tablespoon. I've never gone beyond that so I don't know if more is better.

You are going for large bite sized pieces.
Mix the sake, soy, mirin, salt, ginger and garlic in with the chicken. Let sit 15-20 minutes minimum. Up to an hour is OK.
Individually dust the chicken pieces with the potato starch. Don't go overboard. Don't double dredge. It will be tough. You really want a light hand here. Set chicken on a rack on a cookie sheet until you are ready to fry.
Pre-heat the oil in a heavy frying pan. A nice large cast iron pan works well here. Go for about 1 inch of oil in the pan. Use a candy thermometer. You want your oil at 340-350F when the chicken goes in. Regulate your heat to try to keep it in the range while the chicken cooks if you can.
A word of caution here. Don't add a bunch of chicken at the same time. You run the risk of the oil bubbling up over the edge of your pan. That's really bad. Dangerous. Be careful. Cook smart.
Working in batches, deep fry the chicken until it reaches an internal temperature of 170F. Get an instant read thermometer if you don't have one. Instant read thermometers are how you get consistent results.
Once the first batch of chicken is done, set it on paper towels on a plate. Repeat until all the chicken is cooked.
Serve with fresh lemon and optionally Japanese (kewpie) mayonnaise. Kewpie mayo is not the same as regular mayo. You can also sprinkle a bit of shichimi togarashi on it if you want a bit more zing.

Pre-heat your oven to 375F. Put an ovenproof skillet large enough to hold the chicken in the oven to pre-heat.
Medium boiled eggs
Gently lower the eggs into the boiling water (the water for the noodles) and cook for 6 1/2 minutes for large eggs. 7 1/2 minutes for extra large eggs.
After 6 1/2 (or 7 1/2 depending on the size of the eggs) minutes place the eggs in a bowl of ice water to cool. You want them to cool quickly to stop the yolks from hardening.
Peel the eggs and set aside.
Cook the chicken
Rub the chicken with a bit of vegetable oil and season with salt.
Remove the skillet from the oven. Be careful. The handle is hot. Putting a bar towel on the handle to remind you is never a bad idea. This is one burn you can live without.
Place the chicken, skin side up, in the skillet and return to the oven.
Cook until the chicken reaches an internal temperature of about 170F. This takes 12-15 minutes. Remember - that handle is hot.
Flip the chicken so the skin side is down and place the pan over medium heat. Fry about a minute. You just want the skin to crisp up and turn golden. Remove the chicken from the pan and tent with foil. Set aside.
Spoon off the fat. Leave the darker liquid and any fond in the pan. That stuff is serious flavour.
Make the broth
Deglaze the pan with a bit of chicken stock. Scrape up any those little bits in the bottom of the pan. Add about two cups of stock. Bring to a simmer.
Place the cubes in the stock, remove from the heat and cover. Let it sit for 5 minutes.
Uncover and look. The cubes should be melted at this point. Stir them into the stock. It isn't easy to get the curry cubes fully melted and smooth. You will likely have to chase little bits around your pot. I've tried all sorts of approaches. This is the best I've figured out so far but it isn't perfect.
Add the remaining stock and simmer for about 4-5 minutes.
While the stock simmers cook the ramen noodles per the instructions on the package.
Drain the noodles.
To serve
Slice each egg in half lengthwise. Be careful. The yolks still have a bit of runny texture.
Divide the noodles across two bowls. Ladle the broth into the bowls. Arrange the chicken overtop the noodles and pour half the broth into each bowl. Add the eggs, submerging slightly to warm them through.

Salt the steaks liberally.
Use a food saver to shrink wrap the steaks.
Pre-heat your sous vide to 116 degrees. See below for guidelines on temperature vs. level of doneness.
Immerse the shrink wrapped steaks in the water and let it cook for about 90-110 minutes.
Remove the steaks from the water bath.
Heat a sturdy skillet large enough to hold the steak in a single layer over medium high heat.
Add about 1 Tbsp of vegetable or peanut oil.
Sprinkle the steaks with black pepper to taste. A nice crust of butcher's grind pepper is nice. Not particularly Japanese but nice.
Sear the steaks one one side for about 20 seconds. Flip and cook on the other side for 20 seconds. Repeat on each side for a total of about 80 seconds.
Sear the sides (stand the steaks up) about 20 seconds on each of the long sides.
Let rest 5 minutes.
Make the simple ponzu sauce
Combine the sake and mirin in a small sauce pan and simmer for 1 minute.
Add the remaining ingredients and stir.

Here's a trick that food bloggers don't advertise. If you want those nifty curled green onions it's easy.
Julienne the green part of a couple green onions.
Immerse the julienned green onion in a small bowl of ice and water.
Stir them around a bit with your finger to get them unstuck from each other.
Let stand about 20 minutes.
Drain and blot on paper towel.

Serve the beef tataki
Slice the beef thinly. Try to get as close to across the grain as you can. If you have a nice Japanese knife this is a good place to use it.

Remove the skin from the pork belly. You can get your butcher to do this for you. If you want to do it yourself it's not that hard if you have a good knife.

Skewer a piece of chicken onto a skewer. You may need to pass the skewer though the chicken more than once. You don't want it flapping around when you cook it. Skewer a piece of green onion (see the pictures above).
Repeat until you have 3-4 pieces of chicken and 2-3 pieces of green onion.
Once you have skewered all the chicken, sprinkle with a bit of salt.
Prepare your grill for high direct heat. See the recommendations above for possible ways to set things up to keep the skewers from burning.
Grill the yakitori, turning regularly until golden and cooked through. Depending on your grill temperature this can take as little as 3-4 minutes.
Drizzle with teriyaki sauce and sprinkle with sesame seeds (not traditional). Alternately serve simply with salt or with yakitori tare (much more traditional).
Teriyaki sauce
Combine all ingredients except the cornstarch slurry and bring to a simmer.
Simmer for 10 minutes, then add the cornstarch mixture and bring back to a simmer.

miso ramen with chashu pork,romain | glebekitchen,https://glebekitchen.com/miso-ramen-with-chashu-pork/,Japanese,https://glebekitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/misoramentop-1.jpg,"['2 lb pork belly (in one piece, skin removed)', '1/4 cup Japanese soy sauce (low sodium or regular)', '1/4 cup mirin', '3/4 cup sake', '2 tbsp sugar', '4 large eggs', '1 cup chashu braising liquid', '2 slices bacon', '1/2 cup shiro miso', '8 cups chicken stock (- no sodium or homemade)', '12 oz dried ramen noodles (- not the ones from the instant soup)', '2-3 oz enoki mushrooms', '4 green onions (finely chopped)']","Chashu pork
Pre-heat your oven to 290F.
Combine the soy, mirin, sake and sugar.
Place the pork belly in a baking dish that's not too much bigger than the pork belly. I use a loaf pan.
Pour the soy mixture over the pork and cover the baking dish with tin foil. You want to get it fairly well sealed.
Place the pork in the pre-heated oven and cook, turning the dish occasionally to ensure even cooking. You are going for an internal temperature of 195F. This will take about 2 hours.
When you hit 195F remove the pork from the marinade and chill. Cool the marinade down and skim and discard the fat from the surface. This is going to be the base of your ramen broth flavouring.
Medium boiled eggs
In a medium saucepan, bring water to a boil. Boil large eggs for 6 minutes 30 seconds. If using extra large eggs boil them for 7 minutes 30 seconds. You may have to adjust your times slightly depending on the exact size of your eggs but this should get you pretty close.
Submerge the eggs in really cold or ice water to chill. This stops the egg yolks from continuing to set up. Peel and set aside. They will warm up in the broth.
Miso tare - the flavouring
Combine the chashu braising liquid with 1/2 cup shiro miso in a small sauce pan over medium low heat.
Warm the chashu miso mixture, mixing the miso gently. It will go in as a 1/2 cup lump so you are trying to get it to gradually dissolve.
Add the bacon and simmer, covered, over the lowest heat for 1 hour. Keep an eye on it. You may need to add a bit of chicken stock to thin it out a bit. You want to wind up with about the same amount of miso tare that you started with. Remove and discard the bacon.
Miso ramen
Cook the noodles per the instructions on the package. If the instructions are in Japanese 4 minutes is about right for the thin ramen noodles. Drain and set aside. Don't let them sit too long. Try to time it so the noodles are ready when you are ready to assemble the ramen bowls.
Heat the chicken broth to a simmer.
Using your sharpest thin knife cut the eggs in half lengthwise. They will be a bit runny inside so be ready.
Slice the pork belly. You want it about 3/16 inches thick. Warm it in the chicken broth briefly.
Add about 4 Tbsp miso tare to each of 4 pre-warmed bowls. Then add 2 cups of chicken stock to each bowl. Stir and taste. You will want to add a bit more tare. You are going for the point where you are not quite sure if it's too salty. That's when it's perfect. This should be around 5 Tbsp but really this is up to your taste. It will probably be less if you used regular sodium soy sauce or there was sodium in your chicken broth.
Add the noodles, then add the pork belly, egg, and enoki mushrooms.

Cook the beef or chicken
Slice the beef into 1/4 inch slices or cut the chicken into 3/4 inch cubes.
Heat the oil in a pan large enough to hold the stock until it just shimmers.
Fry the beef or chicken until just done. Remove.
Medium boiled eggs
Gently lower the eggs into the boiling water (the water for the noodles) and cook for 6 1/2 minutes.
After 6 1/2 minutes place the eggs in a bowl of ice water to cool. You want them to cool quickly to stop the yolks from hardening.
Once they have cooled slice each egg in half lengthwise. Be careful. The yolks still have a bit of runny texture.
Make the broth
Chop the cubes into small pieces
Deglaze the pan with a bit of chicken stock then add about another cup of stock.
Add the chopped cubes into the stock and bring to a boil. These things don't dissolve very well so you will have to chase them with a spatula.
Once the cubes have dissolved add the remaining stock and simmer for about 4-5 minutes.
While the stock simmers cook the ramen noodles per the instructions on the package.
Drain the noodles.
To serve
Divide the noodles across two bowls. Arrange the beef or chicken overtop the noodles and pour half the broth into each bowl. Add the eggs, submerging slightly to warm them through.

For 40 gyoza 2 Tbsp of soy to 1 Tbsp of rice wine vinegar should be about enough. Scale it up - 2 parts soy to 1 part rice wine vinegar if you need more...
The filling
Slice the napa cabbage as thinly as you can.
Mix in 1 tsp salt and let the cabbage stand for around 15 minutes.
Working a big handful at a time, squeeze the water out of the cabbage. Do this over the sink. Squeeze hard to get as much water out as possible or your gyoza will be soggy.
Add the chives, ginger, garlic, togarashi shichimi, miso and sesame oil. Mix thoroughly. You especially want to distribute the garlic and ginger evenly.
Now mix in the pork. Get you hands in there and really, really mix. Go nuts. This is important. The cabbage keeps the pork from getting tough as it cooks.
Shape the gyoza
Have a small bowl of water handy.
Place a wonton wrapper on a cutting board.
Shape a small ball (like a big marble) of the filling and place it in the middle of the wrapper.
Wet about 1/2 the edge (circumference) of the wrapper with a bit of water. Just dip your finger in the bowl of water and rub the outer edge of the wrapper.
Fold the wrapper over the filling to form a semi-circle. Pinch the middle of the semi-circle where the two halves touch.
Now make those irritating little pleats. Do the side to the right of the point where the two sides are pinched, then do the left. Google a video for this. It helps. Or be a trend setter and just don't bother.
Cook the gyoza
Pre-heat a frying pan with a tight fitting lid over medium heat. Non-stick won't brown the gyoza as well as a regular pan but they do have a tendency to stick a bit so decide what your priorities are.
Add 1 tsp vegetable oil and 1 tsp sesame oil.
Making sure you don't let the gyoza touch, carefully place as many as will reasonably fit in the pan and fry, flat side down (pleated side up if you bothered) for about 2 minutes. Check to see how they are browning.
When they are just a bit less brown than you want, add a 1/4 cup of water. Be careful. You are adding water to hot oil. That's generally not a good idea. It will splatter.
Cover, turn the heat to medium-low and cook for about 2-3 minutes.
Remove the lid, turn the heat back to medium and cook until the water has evaporated.
If you are into food safety, check the internal temperature with an instant read thermometer. You want the inside to read at least 160F. I've never seen it not get there but it's always a good idea to check.
Sprinkle with togarashi shichimi if you have it.
