How to Make Soy Milk at Home,Kaitlin,https://thewoksoflife.com/how-to-make-soy-milk/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/how-to-make-soy-milk-6-1.jpg,"['10 ounces soybeans ((285g, soaked overnight))', '12 cups water', '1/8 teaspoon salt', 'Sugar ((to taste, optional))']","First, rinse your soybeans, put in a large bowl, and completely submerge with cold water. Set aside and let soak overnight.
The next day, rinse the soybeans a couple of times and transfer to a large pot. Add 12 cups of water to the beans, and bring to a boil using high heat and continue to cook for 10 more minutes using medium heat.
Next, blend the soybeans and water in batches until completely smooth. We used our Blendtec’s “smoothie” setting. Transfer the blended soybean mixture to another pot and let simmer for 40 minutes. Watch it carefully, as it’s easy for the soymilk to boil over! Towards the end of the 40 minutes, add salt and sugar to taste (if using), stirring to dissolve.
After 40 minutes, strain the soymilk through a fine cheesecloth. It’s ideal to use cheesecloth, which will result in the cleanest and smoothest soy milk, but you can also use a fine-meshed strainer, as we did. If you use a fine-meshed strainer, you’ll want to let your soy milk settle before using it, as there will be some soybean solids at the bottom of whatever bottle or container you use to store it. This is especially important if you’re using the soymilk for coffee. If you’re using it for baking or to make a Chinese dish like Dou Jiang, a few solids are just fine.
Transfer the soymilk to a bottle, jar, or other airtight container and store in the fridge on the top shelf in the back to preserve it for longer! It’s best to finish it as soon as you can--we wouldn’t recommend keeping it for longer than a few days. As with all homemade staples like pickles, tomato sauce, etc. it’s best to exercise caution!",en-US,"{'calories': '133 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '10 g', 'proteinContent': '9 g', 'fatContent': '6 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '1 g', 'sodiumContent': '203 mg', 'fiberContent': '1 g', 'sugarContent': '7 g', 'servingSize': '1 serving'}",4.5,,The Woks of Life,740,8 serving(s)

Slice the tofu into ½ inch (1 cm) thick, 1 ½ inch x 2 inch (4x5 cm) rectangles. Make the brine by stirring together the garlic powder, onion powder, salt, sugar, and warm water. Place the tofu into the brine for 1-2 hours.
After 1 to 2 hours, drain the liquid from the tofu completely, and let it sit for 5 minutes to drain. Again, remove any standing liquid, gently toss the tofu pieces in the sesame oil and Shaoxing wine.
Next, make the salt and pepper tofu seasoning, and dredge the tofu:
Combine the salt, ground white pepper, Sichuan peppercorn powder, and sand ginger powder. You’ll use half of this salt and pepper spice mix for the tofu coating and the other half to finish the dish in the wok.
Add half of the spice mix to the all-purpose flour and cornstarch, and sprinkle the mixture over the tofu to coat. Flip the tofu pieces over, and sprinkle them with the remainder of the flour mixture. The moist tofu will soak up the dredge, and a batter-like coating will form on the surface. You can add a little more cornstarch if the mixture looks too wet, or if you want the tofu crispier.
Make the crispy garlic:
Heat 4 tablespoons oil in your wok over low heat for 30 seconds. Add the garlic. It should bubble and sizzle very slowly at this low heat and not burn. Be patient, because burnt garlic has a very bitter flavor. Move the garlic around in the oil so it cooks evenly. It’s done when it has turned a light golden brown.
Remove it using a slotted spoon or fine mesh strainer, leaving the oil in the wok. Transfer the garlic to a plate lined with a paper towel.
Pan-fry the tofu & finish the dish:
Heat the oil in the wok over medium-high heat. Place the tofu in the wok in a single layer, and brown the tofu, adjusting the heat as needed. Don’t walk away, as you don’t want to burn the crust! After the tofu starts to brown, flip the tofu to brown the other side. When done, transfer the tofu to a plate.
Use the remaining oil in the wok to coat the sides of the wok, and pour off any excess standing oil to use in another dish.
Turn stove up to medium high heat. Add the sliced long hot green peppers and shallots and Stir-fry for 15-30 seconds. Next, add the warm tofu and gently toss the mixture for another 30 to 60 seconds. Add the scallions, cilantro, and crispy garlic. Continue tossing for another 15 seconds.
Sprinkle the rest of the salt and pepper spice evenly over the tofu and aromatics. It will absorb into the freshly fried tofu for that extra kick.

Julienne the bamboo shoots, carrots, and ginger, and set aside. Once the shitake mushrooms are done soaking, squeeze out any excess water, remove the tough stems, and thinly slice them.
With your wok over medium heat, add 3 tablespoons oil. Add the ginger, and cook for 20 seconds. Add the carrots, and stir-fry for 1 minute. Add the mushrooms and bamboo shoots, turn up the heat, and and cook for another 2-3 minutes, until fragrant.
Stir in the Shaoxing wine, light soy sauce, and vegetarian oyster sauce. Continue cooking until all the liquid has reduced. Remove from the wok, and let the filling cool.
Prepare your steamer with enough water for 12 minutes of steaming over high heat, and bring to a boil.
Lay out one of your sheets of bean curd on a clean work surface. Take your mixture of vegetarian oyster sauce and water, and brush lightly onto one of the sheets. Stack another sheet on top and brush that one too with the oyster sauce mixture.
Add half of the filling to the lower part of the bean curd circle (about 5 inches/13 cm) from the edge closest to you), arranging it in a roughly 7x3 inch horizontal rectangle. Fold the sheet over the filling tightly. Fold the sides over the middle, and continue rolling tightly until you’ve formed a rectangular roll. Repeat with another 2 sheets of bean curd skin and the other half of the filling.
With the opening side down, lay them side by side on a heat proof dish. When the water in your steamer has come to a boil, steam the rolls for 12 minutes over high heat.
Meanwhile, mix the braising sauce. Combine 1 ¼ cups of the mushroom soaking water, 1 tablespoon vegetarian oyster sauce, 2 teaspoons sugar, 1 tablespoon Shaoxing wine, 1 tablespoon light soy sauce, 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil and 1/2 teaspoon dark soy sauce. Mix until sugar is completely dissolved, and set aside.
Remove the rolls from the steamer. Heat a clean wok/pan over medium heat. When the wok is heated, add the oil, and swirl it around the perimeter of the wok to coat it evenly.

Break up the graham crackers into smaller pieces and put them in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse until they’ve turned into crumbs.

Do not over-mix or allow too much air into the mixture.
Pour the filling into your prepared crust. Tap the pan against the counter a few times to get rid of any air bubbles, and place it in a rimmed baking sheet filled with 1 cm of water.

Shepherd’s Purse Tofu Soup,Bill,https://thewoksoflife.com/shepherds-purse-tofu-soup/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/shepherds-purse-tofu-soup-3.jpg,"['8 ounces frozen Shepherd’s purse', '½ block silken tofu', '4 cups homemade chicken stock', '1 1/2 teaspoons salt ((or to taste))', '1 teaspoon sesame oil', '¼ teaspoon ground white pepper', '1/4 cup cornstarch', '3 egg whites']","Prepare the shepherd’s purse by thawing it out in a colander. When it’s completely thawed, use your hands to gently squeeze the water from it. Chop the leaves into small pieces. Set aside.
Prepare, the silken tofu by cutting it into ½-inch cubes. Set aside. It can be tricky to keep them in a cube shape since the silken tofu is delicate, so don’t worry if they aren’t perfect.
Heat the chicken stock in a medium pot or wok. Add the salt, sesame oil, and ground white pepper. Let everything come to a slow simmer.
Stir up your cornstarch and water mixture since the cornstarch settles at the bottom of the bowl when left standing. Turn the heat down, and use your metal hoak or soup ladle to stir the soup in a circular motion so the soup is moving and swirling. Slowly drizzle all of the cornstarch slurry into the soup while stirring. The trick to thickening the soup with cornstarch is to turn the heat down slightly and keep the soup moving so the cornstarch does not form clumps.
As you continue stirring, turn the heat back up to get the soup to a very low simmer. Check the soup for seasoning and add more salt if needed. Don’t worry if the soup tastes a little saltier than you’d like at this stage, because the Shepherd’s purse and the silken tofu are both unseasoned.
Simmer the soup for a minute, and add the chopped shepherd’s purse. Stir it gently until the leaves are well distributed.
Next, gently add the silken tofu cubes into the soup, and stir, taking care not to break up the tofu. You want to ensure that the tofu and shepherd’s purse are uniformly distributed in the soup and that both are heated evenly. The soup should start to simmer in about 2 to 4 minutes. At this point, you can add a bit more cornstarch slurry if you like a thicker soup, but keep in mind that the soup will thicken more as it cools.
Beat the egg whites briskly for about 10 seconds until the white is broken up and just starts to bubble.
Next, take your ladle or hoak and move it in a wide, steady swirling motion around the perimeter of the pot or wok until the soup is moving. Slowly drizzle the egg white into the soup.
At this point, adjust the heat so the soup is simmering. Taste the soup again, and season to taste with salt, white pepper, and sesame oil if needed. (Sesame oil and especially white pepper enhances the taste of the Shepherd’s purse, so you can add more or simply put these condiments on the table so they can be added as needed.)
Ladle the soup into bowls to serve or pour the soup into a larger family style soup bowl to serve at the table.",en-US,"{'calories': '121 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '13 g', 'proteinContent': '9 g', 'fatContent': '4 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '1 g', 'cholesterolContent': '5 mg', 'sodiumContent': '680 mg', 'fiberContent': '1 g', 'sugarContent': '3 g', 'servingSize': '1 serving'}",4.86,,The Woks of Life,25,6 serving(s)

This keeps the final dish clear of any impurities/blood from the meat.
Fry the peanuts in the oil on low heat for 2 minutes, until just starting to turn golden brown. More oil will be fried out of the peanuts, and the mixture will become fragrant.
Add the chili bean sauce to the peanuts and oil, and stir for 30 seconds to bring out the color of the red peppers in the sauce and infuse the oil, which is what you are looking for in this dish.
Next, add the onions and stir fry for 2 minutes on medium low heat until the onion begins to turn translucent.
Add the carrots, five spice tofu, and sugar, and stir fry for another 3 minutes on medium heat. Next, add 1 cup of chicken stock and the blanched pork and continue to stir fry until the liquid has evaporated (about 5 minutes). Add another cup of stock and repeat the stir-frying again until the liquid has evaporated. This continuous stir-fry melds all the flavors together.
Add the remaining 4 cups of stock, and bring it to a boil. Turn the heat down to medium low and simmer for another 30 minutes. Check the mixture every 5 minutes while simmering and give it a stir so the sauce on the side of the wok does not burn. The final sauce should have a cup of liquid and lots of oil.
Boil the noodles according to package directions until al dente. Chewy noodles are always the best for soup!
Divide the noodles and sauce among four bowls. Season with a little bit of salt if needed, and then pour over the water that you used to cook the noodles to create the soup. (This is how it’s done traditionally, but alternatively, you can use more hot chicken stock as your soup).

Now you’re ready to assemble the soondubu. Heat a small pot or your handy dandy earthenware Korean stew pot over medium-high heat. It takes a few minutes for the earthenware pot to get hot--don’t rush it, as there’s a chance it could crack if heated too quickly.
Add the oil to the pot, followed by the garlic and onions. (Note, if you’re cooking these two servings in two separate individual-serving pots, you’ll have to split all the ingredients down the middle for each.)

Meanwhile, in a mixing bowl, combine 1/3 cup cornstarch, garlic powder, onion powder, 5 spice powder, salt and water until a thick batter forms. Add the tofu and gently toss in the batter until thoroughly coated.
Prepare the sauce by mixing together the soy sauce, dark soy sauce, sugar, salt, rice vinegar, sesame oil, 2 teaspoons cornstarch and 2/3 cup warm water. Stir the sauce until everything is dissolved and combined.
Add 1/4 cup of peanut oil (or vegetable oil) to a medium to large nonstick frying pan over low heat and add 1 cup of the blanched shelled peanuts.

Next, adjust the heat to medium, and gently place each cube of tofu in the pan. Let the tofu fry for about 5 minutes, or until the bottoms are browned.

To cook them, you can try the baking method by drizzling everything with olive oil and baking at about 375 degrees until they're crisp. But we found that shallow frying them in a thin layer of oil yielded crispier and tastier results. So if you want to go that route, in a cast iron or non-stick pan, heat 1/4 cup of oil and carefully fry the tofu in batches until crisp on all sides. Do the same with the chicken.

Add the cornstarch mixture to your sauce and stir. Let it bubble away until the sauce starts to thicken. (If it gets too thick, splash in a little more water or chicken stock.)

Transfer the chopped ma lan tou and chopped tofu to a mixing bowl, and add the salt, sugar, and oil. Mix thoroughly. The tablespoon of sesame oil will be quite fragrant, and if you want a more subtle flavor, reduce the sesame oil to 1 teaspoon, and add 2 teaspoons of peanut oil instead.
I recommend that you add the salt, sugar, and sesame oil gradually, let the mixture sit for 10 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld, and then adjust the seasonings to your own liking.

This process entails chopping and then folding the shrimp paste over and onto itself, and continuing to chop until you have a paste. We used this same technique in our Dim Sum Stuffed Pepper recipe. Transfer the shrimp paste to a bowl and add in the rest of the filling ingredients. Mix well until combined.
Carefully remove the soft tofu from the carton, draining the excess water. Cut the block in half lengthwise, and cut each half into 5 equal pieces of tofu so you get 10 tofu blocks.
Next, position the tofu slices on a plate or sheet pan. Measure out 2 tablespoons of cornstarch onto a small plate. Next, scoop 1 teaspoon of the filling with a measuring spoon and dip the open end of the spoon onto the cornstarch to coat it. Place a teaspoon of filling onto the middle of each tofu block cornstarch side down. This cornstarch will “glue” the filling onto the tofu. Repeat another 9 times for the other tofu pieces.
Once all the filling is in place, pour the remaining cornstarch into a sieve, and carefully sift the rest evenly over the stuffed tofu. This will give you an extra crispy top-coating.
Heat 4 cups of oil in a wok or small pot to 375 degrees. While you're waiting for the oil to heat up, mix the ingredients for the dipping sauce in a small bowl and set aside.
Use a metal spatula to carefully pick up a block of tofu and slide it into the oil. You can fry them a few at a time, but make sure the oil temperature remains constant. Fry them until golden brown, moving them gently as needed to cook evenly, 2 to 4 minutes. When cooked through, remove them with a slotted spoon or metal spatula to drain on a plate lined with paper towels. You can sprinkle a bit of salt on top if you like, or simply enjoy them with the dipping sauce. Don’t salt the tofu before frying, or it will crack open, and you’ll have a bit of a mess on your hands.

Next, add the oil and cornstarch, mix thoroughly until the pork is coated, and set aside.
Heat your wok over high heat, and spread 2 tablespoons of oil around the wok to evenly coat the surface. Add the tofu slices to the wok in one layer, and let them sear. Don’t move them for a least 1 minute! Tilt your wok so the oil reaches the tofu on all sides. Add more oil if needed.
After another 1 to 2 minutes, the tofu should be browned, and it should not stick to the wok. You may have use a metal spatula to loosen the pieces slightly. Turn down the heat, and carefully flip all of the tofu slices. After the tofu is golden brown on both sides, transfer to a plate. They should be much easier to handle now.
Over high heat, add another 2 tablespoons of oil to your wok. When the wok just starts to smoke a bit, immediately add the pork. Spread the pork around the wok using your metal spatula, and let the meat sear for 20 seconds on one side. Stir fry for another 15 seconds, and scoop out the meat into your marinade bowl. It should be about 80% cooked.
Using the same wok, turn the heat to low, and immediately add 2 tablespoons oil, the minced ginger, the spicy chili bean paste (dou ban jiang), and the white parts of the scallions. Stir this mixture into the oil and let it fry at low heat for 15 seconds to infuse the oil and bring out a rich red color.
Next, add the garlic, black beans, red bell peppers, and the rest of the scallions. Turn the heat to high, and give everything a good stir-frying for 45 seconds. The red pepper will sear and add more natural red color to this dish!
Add the pork and juices from your marinade bowl and the tofu back to the wok. Next, spread 1 tablespoon of Shaoxing wine around the perimeter of the wok, add the sugar, and continue to stir-fry for 15 seconds. Be gentle so you don’t break up the tofu.
After another 15 seconds of stir-frying, spread the hot chicken stock or water around the perimeter of the wok to deglaze it. Continue to stir fry for another 30 seconds, being sure to spread the liquid to the sides of the wok to further deglaze it. (Notice we did not add salt or soy sauce, since the combination of the spicy bean paste and the fermented soybeans is quite salty.)

Beef Tofu Stir-Fry,Bill,https://thewoksoflife.com/beef-tofu-stir-fry/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/beef-tofu-stir-fry-13-1.jpg,"['10 ounces flank steak ((285g, sliced ¼-inch thick))', '1 tablespoon water', '1 teaspoon vegetable oil', '½ teaspoon cornstarch', '¼ teaspoon baking soda', '½ teaspoon soy sauce', '2 tablespoons vegetable or canola oil', '3 thin slices ginger', '2 cloves garlic ((minced))', '2 scallions ((cut at an angle into 1-inch pieces, white and green portions separated))', '2 teaspoons Shaoxing wine', '¾ cup beef or chicken stock', '2 tablespoons oyster sauce', '1 teaspoon soy sauce', '½ teaspoon sesame oil', '¼ teaspoon ground white pepper', '¼ teaspoon sugar', '1 pound regular or soft tofu', '1 tablespoon cornstarch ((mixed with 1 tablespoon of water))']","For the beef & marinade, combine the beef, water, vegetable oil, cornstarch, baking soda, and soy sauce in a medium bowl. Let the beef marinate for 20 minutes.
Heat the wok until smoking and spread 2 tablespoons of oil around the perimeter. Sear the beef for 20 seconds on each side. You want the beef seared on the outside and about 80% done. Remove from the wok and set aside.
Add the ginger, and caramelize for 20 seconds. There should be oil in the wok from searing the beef, but add another tablespoon of oil if needed. Next, add the minced garlic and the white portion of the scallions. Stir fry for 10 seconds, and add the Shaoxing wine.
Stir again for 10 seconds, and add the chicken stock, oyster sauce, soy sauce, sesame oil, white pepper, and sugar. Stir-fry until combined, and then gently slide the tofu into the wok. Be careful––the pieces are delicate and will break up easily without proper handling!
Let the tofu and the sauce come up to a boil, and drop in the green portions of the scallions and the seared beef, including any juices.
While everything is coming up to a boil, mix your cornstarch slurry. Check the seasoning of the sauce, and add more salt or soy sauce if desired, but remember it will get saltier after it thickens!
Carefully stir in the cornstarch slurry, and lower the heat to medium as the sauce thickens. Be as gentle as possible when stirring so as to minimize tofu breakage. A pushing/stirring motion to rotate the mixture around the wok usually works best. Adjust the thickness of the sauce by adding more cornstarch slurry or chicken stock until it is to your liking.

Spiced Tofu Stir-Fry with Garlic Chives,Judy,https://thewoksoflife.com/spiced-tofu-stir-fry-garlic-chives/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/spiced-tofu-stir-fry-garlic-chives-10.jpg,"['1 tablespoon Shaoxing wine ((or dry sherry))', '2 tablespoons light soy sauce', '1/2 teaspoon sugar', '1/2 teaspoon white pepper', '1/2 teaspoon sesame oil', '3 tablespoons oil', '3 slices ginger ((julienned))', '3 cloves garlic ((minced))', '3 pieces spiced tofu ((about 170g/6 ounces, julienned))', '300 g garlic chives ((about 10 ounces, cut into 1.5 inch lengths))', 'salt ((to taste))']","Start by preparing the stir-fry sauce mixture. Combine the wine, light soy sauce, sugar, white pepper, and sesame oil. Set aside.
(At this point, if using pork or chicken, you’d preheat the wok until it was smoking, add a tablespoon of oil, and then sear the meat until just cooked. Remove to a bowl and set aside. If not, move on to the next step.)
Place a wok over medium heat. When the wok has heated, add the oil and the ginger. Cook for 30 seconds, and add the garlic. Cook for another 30 seconds.
Add the tofu, and stir-fry for another minute. Turn up the heat to high, add the garlic chives, and stir-fry for 1 minute (at this point, you can also add your pre-cooked meat, if using). Add the sauce mixture, and stir-fry for another 30 seconds. Season with salt to taste. The dish is done once the chives are wilted.

Ultimate Braised Tofu,Bill,https://thewoksoflife.com/braised-tofu/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/braised-tofu-5.jpg,"['1 pound silken tofu ((450g, organic preferred!))', '2 cups oil ((for frying))', '1 cup chicken stock ((can also use vegetable stock or soaking liquid from dried shiitake mushrooms))', '1 tablespoon oyster sauce ((or vegetarian oyster sauce))', '1 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce', '1 teaspoon dark soy sauce', '½ teaspoon sesame oil', '¼ teaspoon sugar', '¼ teaspoon salt ((or to taste))', '3 small slices ginger ((1/8 inch thick, smashed with the broad side of a knife))', '3 cloves garlic ((finely minced))', '2 scallions ((cut at an angle into 2 inch long pieces, white and green portions separated))', '4 fresh shiitake mushrooms ((or 4 dried shiitake mushrooms soaked in warm water for 30 mins))', '1 medium carrot ((thinly sliced at an angle))', '2/3 cup fresh winter bamboo shoots ((or canned if fresh shoots are not available))', '1 tablespoon Shaoxing wine', '1/2 cup snap peas', '1 1/2 tablespoons cornstarch ((mixed with 2 tablespoons water))']","Cut the tofu into 10 pieces, transfer to a plate, and let it sit at room temperature for 30 minutes. Carefully tilt the plate and pour off the liquid. This step allows you to remove some of the water content from the very wet silken tofu.
In a tall pot, heat oil to 375 to 400 degrees F. Make sure that the oil is well below the rim of the pot, so the oil does not overflow. It also minimizes splattering. You can use a candy or oil thermometer to check the temperature.
Use a metal spatula or slotted spoon to carefully scoop up one piece at a time and lower it quickly into the hot oil. I suggest frying 3 to 4 pieces at a time, keeping the heat at medium high, because the tofu will cool the oil quickly. You need to maintain that high oil temperature to quickly brown the outside and form a light crust.
Deep fry your silken tofu until light golden brown (about 2 to 3 minutes per batch) and set aside on a dry plate. Oil temperature control is key, as you want to maintain the temperature between 375 and 400 degrees F.
In a bowl, combine the stock, oyster sauce, soy sauces, sesame oil, sugar, and salt together in a bowl and set aside.
Heat your wok over medium heat and add 2 tablespoons of the frying oil around the perimeter of the wok so it is lightly coated. Add the smashed ginger to the wok and stir it in the oil for about 15 seconds. Stir in the minced garlic, the white portion of the scallions, the mushrooms, carrots, and bamboo shoots, and turn the heat up to high. Stir-fry for 30 seconds and add the Shaoxing wine and the snap peas.
Continue to stir-fry for another 30 seconds, and add the sauce mixture. Bring the mixture up to a boil. Once boiling, add the cornstarch and water mixture and stir for 15 seconds until the sauce starts to thicken. Add the fried silken tofu and the rest of the scallions.
Carefully fold the mixture together until the tofu is well-coated. Use extra care, because the fried silken tofu is still very delicate! Let your braised tofu cook for another 15 to 20 seconds and add a little more cornstarch and water if you want a thicker sauce.",en-US,"{'calories': '267 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '16 g', 'proteinContent': '9 g', 'fatContent': '19 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '2 g', 'cholesterolContent': '2 mg', 'sodiumContent': '837 mg', 'fiberContent': '2 g', 'sugarContent': '5 g', 'servingSize': '1 serving'}",4.67,,The Woks of Life,45,4 serving(s)
