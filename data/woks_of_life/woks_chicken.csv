Wash the chicken clean and remember to set aside the piece of chicken fat at the back cavity. Transfer the chicken to a plate and pat dry with a paper towel. Lightly rub the chicken with the salt. This will give the chicken skin a nice sheen. Set it aside.
Bring the water, along with the ginger and scallions, to a boil in a large stockpot. Before adding the chicken to the pot, rinse the chicken under running water to wash away the salt. Carefully lower the chicken into the boiling water, positioning the chicken breast-side up. Now is a good time to adjust the water level so the chicken breast just pokes above the water (so you aren’t left with dry white meat).
Once the water boils, carefully lift the chicken out of the water to pour out the colder water that is trapped in the cavity. Carefully lower the chicken back into the pot. Bring the water to a boil again, and cover the lid. Turn off the heat, and leave the pot covered on the stove for 45-50 minutes (set a timer). To check if the chicken is done, stick a toothpick into the thickest part of the drumstick. If the juices run clear, it’s cooked through.
When the 45-minute timer (for the chicken) is almost up, prepare a large ice bath. Once the chicken is cooked, carefully lift the chicken out of the pot, drain the water from the cavity and lower it into the ice bath. Take care not to break the skin. After 15 minutes in the ice bath, the chicken should be cooled completely, drain and cover with clear plastic until ready to cut and serve. The ice bath stops the cooking process, locks in the juices, and gives the chicken skin better texture.
To make the rice:
While the chicken is cooling, make the rice. Heat a wok over medium heat. Add the chicken fat and render for about a minute. Stir in the minced garlic and fry briefly, making sure it doesn’t burn.
Add the uncooked rice. Stir continuously for about two minutes.
Turn off the heat. Scoop the rice into your rice cooker and add the appropriate amount of chicken stock (instead of the usual water. This amount may vary depending on your rice cooker) and salt. Close the lid and press START.
If you don’t have a rice cooker, you can follow these steps. When you wash your rice, let it soak for an additional 20 minutes. Then drain the rice and follow the same steps above, but instead of transferring the rice mixture to your rice cooker, transfer it to a medium/large pot. Add 3 cups of chicken stock and the salt, giving it a quick stir. Cover the pot and bring to a boil. Once it boils, immediately turn down the heat to the lowest setting. Let the rice simmer and cook (covered) for 10-15 minutes until the rice is done. It’s not quite as foolproof as the rice cooker, but you should get a very similar result. Just be sure to keep an eye on it; burnt rice is no fun.
While the rice is cooking, let’s prepare the three signature dipping sauces. You can also start preparing these sauces while the chicken is cooking in the pot.
To Make Sauce 1: The Ginger Garlic Sauce
Grind the ginger and garlic in a food processor until a paste forms. Heat the oil in a small pot or saucepan. Gently fry the ginger and garlic until aromatic and just lightly caramelized. You want it to be just cooked so that it no longer has that spicy raw flavor of uncooked ginger and garlic. Add salt to taste and transfer to a sauce dish.
To Make Sauce 2: Sweet Dark Soy Sauce
Heat the water and sugar in a small saucepan over medium heat. Stir constantly until the sugar dissolves and the liquid thickens into a simple syrup. Add the dark soy sauce, stirring to combine. Transfer to a sauce dish.
To Make Sauce 3: Chili Sauce
Grind the chilies, ginger, and garlic in a food processor until finely chopped. You will probably have to scrape down the sides of the food processor 1-2 times to ensure everything is ground up evenly. Add the sesame oil, salt, sugar, lime juice, and vinegar to the food processor. Pulse 2-3 times to combine.
Transfer to a small bowl and add chicken broth (what you used to boil the chicken) 1 tablespoon at a time until a saucy consistency is achieved. This is really about your preference too; if you like a thicker paste, add less broth. The broth also helps the sauce come together and adds additional chicken flavor!",en-US,"{'calories': '722 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '90 g', 'proteinContent': '32 g', 'fatContent': '25 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '6 g', 'cholesterolContent': '82 mg', 'fiberContent': '2 g', 'sugarContent': '10 g', 'servingSize': '1 serving'}",4.91,,The Woks of Life,155,6 serving(s)
"Sour Plum Duck, A Hakka Chinese Classic",Bill,https://thewoksoflife.com/sour-plum-duck/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/sour-plum-duck-14.jpg,"['1 whole duck ((2.25 kg, about 5 pounds))', '1 teaspoon salt', '½ teaspoon white pepper', '1/4 teaspoon ground ginger', '1½ tablespoons canola oil', '2 cloves garlic ((minced))', '5 shallots ((thinly sliced, about ½ cup))', '3 large onions ((thinly sliced, about 4 cups))', '6 salted plums ((Koon Chun Brand))', '1½ cups plum sauce ((Koon Chun Brand))', '1½ cups low sodium chicken stock ((680g))', '3 to 4 pieces dried orange or tangerine peel', '1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar']","Remove the giblet packet from the duck, rinse both the inside and outside of the duck thoroughly, and let the water drain out. You can discard the giblets or place them in the pot with the duck if you like. Pat the duck dry with a paper towel. Combine the salt, white pepper, and ginger in a small bowl, and rub the spice mix evenly all over the duck, both outside and inside the cavity. Set aside to marinate for 30 minutes.
Heat 1½ tablespoons canola oil in a large Dutch oven (or other oven-safe pot with a lid) over medium-high heat. Sear the duck on both sides until lightly browned and transfer the duck to a plate. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Add the garlic, shallots, and onions to the pot where you seared the duck. Fry for 3-5 minutes, until softened.
Use your hands or a fork to smash the salted plums, and add them to the pot. The plums should be pitted, but it is also okay to just add the pits and pick them out before serving. Also stir in the plum sauce, chicken stock, dried citrus peels, and vinegar. Mix well over medium heat and bring to a simmer. Once simmering, remove from the heat.
Spoon one cup of the onion mixture into the duck cavity, using a spoon to coat the inside of the duck as best as possible. Spread some of the sauce over the outside of the duck so it is lightly coated. With the onion mixture that's left in the pot, spread it out evenly across the bottom of the pot and carefully place the duck on top (breast side down). Cover the pot and place into the preheated oven for 60 minutes.
Take the pot out of the oven, and using a large roasting fork, carefully lift the duck up to dump the onions and liquid out of the cavity. Then carefully flip the duck so the breast is facing up. There should still be plenty of liquid at the bottom of the pan, but feel free to add a bit of chicken stock if it's looking dry.
Cover and return to the oven for another 30 to 60 minutes depending upon how tender you like your duck. Check the duck after 30 minutes for tenderness and add more stock if the sauce is drying out. Once you are satisfied with the tenderness, cook for another 15 minutes uncovered. Again, if there is no sauce, add in more chicken stock. Transfer the pot from the oven to the stovetop, and carefully transfer the duck to a serving plate or cutting board for carving.
Stir the sauce, discarding the tangerine peels and plum pits. If all went well, the sauce should have turned into a beautiful onion marmalade. Reduce the sauce over the stovetop if it is too thin, or add chicken stock to deglaze if the sauce is too dry.
Spoon some of the sauce and onions over the top of the duck, and serve the rest of the sauce on the side.",en-US,"{'calories': '765 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '50 g', 'proteinContent': '18 g', 'fatContent': '55 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '17 g', 'cholesterolContent': '97 mg', 'sodiumContent': '901 mg', 'fiberContent': '3 g', 'sugarContent': '11 g', 'servingSize': '1 serving'}",4.5,,The Woks of Life,200,6 serving(s)

One trick for the noodles is to soak the whole bag (unopened) in hot water, which speeds up the warming process without making the noodles soggy.
If you can’t find lo mein noodles, you can actually substitute dried linguini. Just cook until al dente, drain, and immediately toss with 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil, working the oil into the pasta so the noodles don't stick together. Always prepare your noodles just before you are ready to make the dish, so they don’t dry out and remain at room temperature or warmer. This makes the stir-frying process much easier.
Combine the sugar, soy sauces, oyster sauce, sesame oil, and white pepper in a bowl until the sugar is dissolved and set aside. Heat a large wok over high heat until it just starts to smoke, and add 1 tablespoon of oil around the perimeter of the wok. Quickly spread the shrimp around your wok and let them sear for 10-15 seconds on each side. Immediately transfer the shrimp to a plate and set aside.
Return the wok to the highest heat possible and add 2 tablespoons oil, along with the garlic. After a few seconds, add the mushrooms, carrots, bamboo shoots, and water chestnuts and stir-fry for 30 seconds.
Next, spread the Shaoxing wine around the perimeter of the wok, and then add the napa cabbage. Stir-fry for another 30 seconds. Spread the noodles evenly over the vegetables and give everything a good stir for 1 minute. Now, you can see why you want everything at room temperature, or everything will be overcooked and mushy by the time it heats up!
At this point, the noodles should be softened, so add in the sauce mixture you set aside earlier and mix until everything is well combined. Stir-fry for another 30 seconds using a scooping motion, until the sauce is well distributed. Add in the shrimp, snow peas, bean sprouts, and scallions.

After cleaning, cut off the tough bottom portion of the lily flowers. Cut off the mushroom stems as well, which will speed up the soaking process.
Transfer the wood ears, lily flowers, and mushrooms to three separate bowls filled with water, and soak for one to two hours. Use a plate to cover and press each of the dried ingredients down to ensure they are fully rehydrated.
Once reconstituted, roughly chop the wood ears. Squeeze some of the excess water from the mushrooms, and slice each one into quarter-inch thick slices. Be sure to squeeze the lily flowers dry as well.
Place the chicken, wood ears, mushrooms, lily flowers, water, vegetable oil, sesame oil, rice wine (if using), oyster sauce, sugar, salt, white pepper, grated ginger, and the white portions of the scallions into a bowl. Mix until most of the liquid is absorbed into the chicken. Set the green portions of the scallions aside. Cover the chicken and marinate for a minimum of 2 hours, or in the refrigerator overnight.
When you’re ready to cook the dish, let the chicken mixture come up to room temperature, and add the cornstarch until it is uniformly incorporated. At this point, all of the liquid should be absorbed into the chicken, and there should be little or no standing liquid.
Transfer the mixture to a deep plate or pie dish, and sprinkle half of the green portion of the scallions over the top. Place in a covered steamer, and steam over medium high heat for 10 minutes. Shut off the heat, and leave the chicken in the steamer for another 2 minutes.

Add the chicken to a large mixing bowl along with the salt, white pepper, ginger, sesame oil, and 2 tablespoons of water. Mix thoroughly and set aside for 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, make the coating. In a shallow bowl, combine the potato starch and panko. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of water over the top, and mix with your hands. This creates some clumps in the dry mix to give more texture to the coating.
Toss the chicken in the marinade once more to ensure the pieces are evenly moist. Dredge chicken pieces until they’re completely coated.
Fry the chicken for the first time:
Heat 4-5 cups of oil in a deep pot to 325°F/163°C. The oil should ideally fill the pot about halfway, so hot oil won’t overflow or splatter too much while frying.
Fry the chicken in batches until lightly golden, 2-3 mins for nuggets, 3-4 mins for tenders, 6-8 mins for whole wings, 4-6 mins for drumettes and flats, and 9-11 mins for drumsticks or bone-in thighs. Drain on a cooling rack placed over a sheet pan, and between batches, remove any particles left in the oil using a strainer.
Make the glaze:
In a saucepan over medium low heat, add 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, along with the shallot, garlic, and dried chili peppers (if using, for optional spice). Cook for 3-4 minutes, stirring occasionally, or until the shallots are translucent. If using the dried chili peppers, you can de-seed them and chop them, or simply chop and include the seeds for an extra spicy kick. If you’d like to keep your sauce more mild, omit them entirely.
Next, add the soy sauce, water, mirin, rice vinegar, light brown sugar, gochujang, and dijon mustard.
Stir and bring the sauce to a simmer, stirring continuously (4-5 minutes). When the sauce has come to a simmer, remove from the heat, cover, and set aside to keep warm.
Re-fry chicken and toss in sauce:
For the second and final fry, bring the oil temperature up to 375°F/190°C. Fry the chicken in batches—1 minute for bone-in pieces and 30 seconds for boneless pieces. Drain on a cooling rack.

Smoked Turkey Legs (Disney Copycat Recipe),Kaitlin,https://thewoksoflife.com/smoked-turkey-legs-disney-copycat-recipe/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/smoked-turkey-legs-11-1.jpg,"['1 gallon water', '1 cup salt', '½ cup brown sugar', '3 tablespoons garlic powder', '3 tablespoons onion powder', '3 tablespoons dried thyme', '3 tablespoons dried sage', '1 1/2 tablespoons black pepper', '1 teaspoon ground cloves', '1 teaspoon ground allspice', '1 tablespoon paprika', '1 teaspoon liquid smoke', '10 turkey legs', 'Natural hardwood lump charcoal', 'Smoking wood chips ((e.g. apple wood or hickory))', 'Charcoal grill', 'Charcoal chimney starter']","Combine all of the ingredients for the brine in a large pot and bring to a boil. Let cool. if you're short on time, you can also start by boiling the brine with just 2 quarts of water and then adding ice to cool to 1 gallon of brine.
While that's happening, rinse your turkey legs and set aside in a large container (one that will fit into your refrigerator). You may want to use two separate containers. When the brine has cooled, pour the brine over the turkey legs, making sure they are totally submerged. Cover and refrigerate overnight.
If you want to expedite the process, use a marinade injector, injecting one syringe-full of brine into each turkey leg (1½ syringe-fulls for the larger turkey legs). Then, let brine as usual for 5-6 hours. This way, the turkey legs don't need to brine overnight. Sounds gruesome, but it really expedites the process, and these marinade injectors are pretty inexpensive!
When the turkey legs are ready, heat your charcoal. Your key tools for this recipe are a charcoal grill, a chimney starter, charcoal, and wet wood chips, which provides the smoky flavor. Fill your chimney with charcoal and light the coals with a piece of newspaper. Let heat for a solid 15-20 minutes or so--until the coals are slightly white hot. Also, take 1-2 handfuls of wood chips and soak them in water while the coals are heating.
Pour the coals into the grill and scatter the wood chips around the coals. Lay your grill rack over the coals. Place the turkey legs on the grill rack and close the grill.
chimney-full of coal is enough to start for an average-sized charcoal grill. Add another chimney of coal every 20-30 minutes, depending on the kind of charcoal you're using. Periodically add additional wet wood chips to make more smoke as needed. More wood chips makes more smoke, increasing the ""hammy"" smoked flavor of the turkey legs. You can cater this to your personal preferences. I like a very hammy smoked turkey leg; my aunt prefers more of a natural flavor. Take your pick!
The slow cooking method is key here. Periodically check the turkey legs, turning every once in a while, and make sure the grill maintains a temperature of 300-325 degrees. There is some element of trial and error to this if you're a first-timer; make observations and adjust amounts of charcoal, wood chips, and heat over the course of the cooking time.
Maintain the grill, charcoal, and wood chips, letting the turkey cook for 3 ½ to 4 hours--until the turkey legs have a nice, dark smoky color that a young Chinese girl once thought only existed within the walls of Disney World.

Cantonese Poached Chicken (Bai Qie Ji),Bill,https://thewoksoflife.com/cantonese-poached-chicken-w-ginger-scallion-oil-bai-qie-ji/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/white-cut-chicken-18.jpg,"['3-4 pound whole chicken ((ideally organic free-range; optional head and feet still on; at room temperature))', '2 scallions', '5 slices ginger', '3 tablespoons scallions ((finely minced, white and light green parts only))', '2 tablespoons ginger ((finely minced))', '3 tablespoons oil', 'salt ((to taste))', 'soy sauce ((optional))']","Make sure your chicken is at room temperature (trying to poach a cold chicken right out of the refrigerator will result in uneven cooking or undercooking). Clean the chicken by rinsing it under cold water, paying special attention to the cavity. Any giblets should already be removed but there may still be organs on the inside that should be removed or sometimes stray feathers that need to be plucked. Experts recommend that it's not necessary to wash your chicken before cutting and cooking but in this case for a whole chicken (especially if you get it from a live poultry place or even from Asian markets), it's a step that shouldn't be skipped, in my opinion. When washing and prepping the whole chicken, be very careful about splashing water and contaminating surfaces with unwanted bacteria. Be careful not to break or trim away any of the skin on the chicken, as you don’t want the meat exposed to the boiling water as it cooks. This will ensure a moist, silky texture in the final product.
Fill a large stock pot with water, just enough to submerge the chicken completely. You can determine this by putting the entire chicken in the pot, filling it with water until the chicken is submerged, and then removing the chicken. Do not turn on the heat while the chicken is still in the pot! This method of ensuring you have just enough water to submerge the chicken (and avoiding any extra) will ensure you have a more flavorful stock to save at the end. We used about 18 cups of water to submerge a 4 pound chicken in a deep stock pot.
Once you have your water properly measured into the pot, add 2 scallions and 5 slices of ginger, and bring it to a boil. Once boiling, slowly lower the chicken into the pot, legs down and head up. It’s ok if the breast is peeking out of the water a bit. The water will cool down and stop boiling when you add the chicken, so bring it up to a boil once again, and do not walk away from the pot.
Once the water boils again, IMMEDIATELY lift the chicken out of the water very carefully. You can carefully hook two wooden spoons under the wings to lift the chicken up. The goal is to empty any colder water that may be trapped inside the cavity. Once you’ve released that water, lower the chicken back into the pot, and bring to a boil again.
When the water is JUST starting to boil, turn the heat down. Keep it at barely a simmer. There should be very little movement in the water, but it also shouldn’t be still. Cover the pot, and keep the heat around the lowest setting so the liquid continues to simmer slowly. Cook for about 35-40 minutes, roughly 10-11 minutes per pound. Depending on the size of your chicken, it may take more or less time to cook it through. You can check to make sure the water is bubbling slowly/gently and not boiling too vigorously, but try to avoid uncovering the pot while it’s cooking.
Poke a chopstick or skewer into the thigh to check for doneness. If the juices run clear, it's done. Carefully lift the chicken out of the pot and transfer it to a large bowl of ice water. Cool completely.
While the chicken is cooling, make the sauce. You have the option to make two versions—one with just scallions, ginger, oil and salt, and one with soy sauce. The plain version is more traditional, as it really lets the flavors of chicken, ginger, and scallion shine through. Judy loves to add soy sauce, and it’s also a tasty option! Start with the plain version, and then scoop some of it out into another bowl and add soy sauce. Try both and see which your loved ones like best!
When the chicken is out of the ice water, you can brush it lightly with oil or some of the fat floating atop the poaching liquid to give it that enticing, shiny look!

Fry until light golden brown (about 5 minutes) and transfer to a wire rack or plate lined with paper towels to drain.

You'll want it at room temperature when it hits the pot. Remove the giblets, and thoroughly rinse the chicken inside and out.
Grab your stock pot. It will ideally be a tall, narrow pot that will just fit the chicken, since it should be totally submerged in the cooking liquid (if you use a larger pot, you'll need to increase all the ingredients proportionally to create more cooking liquid). Put it over medium low heat, and add the oil and ginger.
Let the ginger caramelize for about 30 seconds. Then add the scallions and cook another 30 seconds. Add the star anise and wine (you can use Shaoxing rice wine, rose wine or a mix of both), and bring to a simmer to let some of the alcohol cook off. Add the soy sauce, dark soy sauce, sugar, salt, and water. Bring to a simmer again and cook on low heat for another 20 minutes.
Increase the heat to bring the liquid to a slow boil (i.e. a little stronger than a simmer, but not a rolling boil). Use a large roasting fork inserted into the chicken cavity to lower the chicken slowly into the pot breast side up. Make sure any air pockets in the cavity fill up completely with liquid. The chicken should be entirely submerged at this point.
Once the chicken goes in, the cooking liquid will cool down. Let it cook for about 5 minutes at medium high heat. Next, use your large fork to carefully lift the chicken out of the water and empty the liquid inside the cavity, which will be cooler than the liquid surrounding the chicken. Lower the chicken back into the pot, making sure once again that there aren't any air pockets in the cavity. If the chicken is not completely submerged, periodically baste the exposed area with cooking liquid.
Bring the liquid back up to a lazy simmer, which should take about 10 minutes. Keep it at this slow simmer (the liquid will be about 210 degrees F) for 25 minutes. Turn off the heat, cover the pot, and let the chicken sit in the pot for another 15 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a cutting board. If you like, you can use a meat thermometer in the thickest part of the thigh to confirm it's reached 165 degrees F.
Use the sauce from the pot to occasionally baste the chicken and keep the skin moist as it cools. Serve over rice with some sauce from the pot!
Note: You can also make this recipe with chicken leg quarters and reduce the cooking time accordingly, since they are easier to handle and faster to cook. Also, once you're done cooking the chicken, you can actually freeze the sauce/cooking liquid for use again later (though you may have to re-season the sauce).",en-US,"{'calories': '371 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '8 g', 'proteinContent': '28 g', 'fatContent': '23 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '6 g', 'cholesterolContent': '109 mg', 'sodiumContent': '770 mg', 'fiberContent': '1 g', 'sugarContent': '7 g', 'servingSize': '1 serving'}",4.92,,The Woks of Life,105,6 serving(s)

Note: If this sounds too spicy for you, you can add chili oil to taste rather than the entire amount called for.
Stir-fry everything to combine—at this point, it's a glistening, spicy, delicious party.

How to Cut a Whole Chicken Chinese-Style,Bill,https://thewoksoflife.com/how-to-cut-whole-chicken-chinese/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/how-to-carve-whole-chicken-chinese.jpg,['One whole Cantonese Poached Chicken or Soy Sauce Chicken'],"Step 1: Remove the head and neck.
Place the chicken on the cutting board. Cut off the neck where it meets the body of the chicken, and cut off the head (if attached). Put on one side of the platter. This is decorative and symbolic, but you can simply discard it if you prefer. Set the neck aside.
Step 2: Remove and trim the chicken feet.
Cut off the feet at the joint where the drumstick ends. If you have chicken feet lovers, trim off the nails and place them on the platter, alongside the head if you have it. Elders love chicken feet, but if you have no takers, save it for chicken stock.
Step 3: Split the chicken in half.
With the chicken breast-side up, split it in half. When your knife pushes through to the back of the chicken, cut one half off of the side of the backbone, cutting straight through the length of the chicken, leaving the tail intact.
Next, cut the middle backbone lengthwise up through the neck, and you’ll have three pieces, as shown. Two halves, and the backbone with the tail on one end and the neck on the other. If you prefer, you can use sharp kitchen shears instead of a cleaver for this step.
Step 4: Trim the neck, back bone, and tail pieces.
I usually cut the neck pieces and backbone, place them in the middle of the plate, and pile the nicer pieces of the chicken on top, with the tail at the side of the platter opposite the head. You can also save all these pieces for chicken stock instead.
Step 5: Separate the thighs and drumsticks.
Next, take one of the chicken halves, and make a cut in the skin attaching the thigh to the breast. Fold the thigh and drumstick backwards, and it will almost separate itself. Use the cleaver to cut through the cartilage that attaches the thigh to the body.
Separate the drumstick and the thigh by cutting through the cartilage at the joint. If you have a small family or young kids, you may want to leave the whole drumsticks intact on the serving plate. Otherwise use some solid strokes with the cleaver to cut each drumstick into halves on a slight angle/diagonal. Do the same to cut the thighs into ¾-inch pieces.
Keep the cut thigh and drumstick pieces together, and place them on the lower end of the plate
Step 5: Cut the wings.
Next, cut off both whole wings at the joint where the drumette meets the body of the chicken. Next, cut each wing into three pieces: the flat, the drumette, and the wing tip. Place the pieces on one side near the top of the plate where the head is.
Step 6: Cut the breast.
Make a lengthwise cut to separate the rib from the breast, and cut each into 3/4-inch wide pieces. Keep the pieces together as best you can, lifting them off the cutting board with your cleaver and onto the plate.",en-US,{},5.0,,The Woks of Life,10,6 serving(s)

Add the oil, soy sauce, and cornstarch, and mix until well combined. Set aside for 20 minutes.
Next, wash the mung bean sprouts in a large bowl of cold water, leaving the bean sprouts in the water for two to three minutes so they are rehydrated. This step not only washes the sprouts but also allows them to absorb some of that cold water to regain their freshness and crunch. Transfer them to a colander, setting them over a bowl or the sink to let the excess water drain completely. The root portion of the bean sprout can be a bit stringy and unpleasant, and some folks do pinch it off--but a word of caution that it is a lot of work, so we usually settle for a good couple of rinses in cold water.
Finally, prepare the other ingredients--namely the scallions, garlic, and mushrooms. Cooking this dish quickly is really important, so your bean sprouts don’t turn to mush. If you’re not great adding quick measurements of spices, oils, and sauces, it’s best if you have all of those ingredients prepped and measured in advance, in addition to the fresh ingredients.
Heat your wok on high heat until it just starts to smoke, and spread 2 tablespoons of oil around the perimeter of the wok. Add the chicken, and use your spatula to spread the meat evenly across the wok. Sear for another 20 seconds (i.e., without mixing the chicken around), stir fry for another 20 seconds, and transfer the chicken to a bowl.
Add another tablespoon of oil to the wok, along with the mushrooms and the white portions of the scallions. Stir fry for 10 seconds, and add the garlic. You should have the wok at the highest heat you can muster at this point!
Next, add the mung bean sprouts and stir fry everything together. Spread the Shaoxing wine around the perimeter of the wok, and give everything another quick stir. Then add the oyster sauce, salt, sesame oil, white pepper, and MSG, if using.
Add the chicken back to the wok, along with any liquid in the bowl, and the green portions of the scallions. Again, the burner should be at maximum heat at this point! A quick trick that Kaitlin learned cooking on a narrow stovetop in college is to hold the wok between two gas burners at max heat, to get as much heat as possible!
Stir-fry for another 10 seconds until everything is well combined, making sure to spread the mixture around the sides of the wok to get that wok hei sear and flavor. There will be some liquid in the wok and when that is bubbling, stir in the cornstarch and water mixture.

Rinse the chicken, remove any giblets, and pat the bird dry with paper towels. Place the chicken over the sliced onions in an enameled baking dish, and use your fingers to gently spread the spice mixture under the skin, on the outside of the chicken, and inside the cavity, until it is thoroughly seasoned. Tie the legs together with kitchen string. Cover and refrigerate for 4-24 hours.
When you’re ready to roast the chicken, remove it from the refrigerator, and allow it to come back up to close to room temperature (it shouldn’t be ice cold from the fridge). Meanwhile, preheat your oven to 425 degrees F.
Roast the bird in the oven for 15 minutes and then baste it with any juices in the roasting pan.

You can baste it a couple times as it continues to roast. Allow the chicken to rest for a few minutes after you remove it from the oven.
While the chicken is roasting, prepare the sauce. Combine jalapeños, cilantro, garlic, mayonnaise, lime juice, and vinegar in the jar of a blender.

Five Spice Roast Turkey with Giblet Onion Gravy,Sarah,https://thewoksoflife.com/five-spice-roast-turkey-giblet-gravy/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/five-spice-thanksgiving-turkey-11.jpg,"['14-15 pound young turkey', '6 cloves garlic', '2 tablespoons salt', '3 tablespoons soy sauce', '1 tablespoon dark soy sauce', '2 tablespoons Shaoxing wine', '2 teaspoons sugar', '1 teaspoon white pepper', '2 teaspoons five spice powder', '1 teaspoon sand ginger powder or galangal powder', '2 teaspoons sesame oil', '6 medium yellow onions ((cut into wedges))', 'The giblets ((roasted onions, and drippings from the roasting pan))', 'Butter ((if needed))', '¼ cup all purpose flour', '2 teaspoons paprika', 'Chicken stock', '2 teaspoons dark soy sauce', 'Salt and fresh ground black pepper']","Two to three days before roasting, start thawing your turkey in the refrigerator. On the day before you plan to roast it, make the marinade by combining the garlic, salt, soy sauces, wine, sugar, white pepper, five spice powder, sand ginger powder, and sesame oil in the food processor. Pulse until you can’t see any more big chunks of garlic in the mixture.
Spread out the onion wedges in the bottom of your roasting pan. The onions will serve as the “rack” that the turkey will sit on.
Remove the turkey from the package. Remove the neck and the giblets from the turkey cavity and give the bird a good rinse with cold water. Pat it thoroughly dry with paper towels, and lay it breast side down in the pan. Spread half of your marinade all over the bottom side of the turkey, making sure you cover every surface and crevice (including the cavity). Flip the bird over so it's laying breast side up, and spread the other half of the marinade over this side of the turkey. Also spread some of the marinade on the neck and giblets, and add those to the pan as well.
Cover the roasting pan tightly with plastic and allow the turkey to marinate breast side up overnight.
The next day, allow the turkey to sit out on the counter at room temperature for about 2-4 hours to warm up (you don’t want to transfer the turkey directly from the refrigerator to the oven, which may result in uneven cooking). Tie the legs together with kitchen string.
4 hours before you plan to serve the turkey, preheat the oven to 425 degrees F and arrange a rack in the lower third of the oven. Flip the turkey breast side down, and place in the middle of the oven. Roast for 30 minutes. Baste the turkey with any pan drippings, and then rotate the roasting pan 180 degrees so that the turkey cooks evenly. Roast for another 30 minutes.
By now, your turkey has been roasting at 425 degrees F for 1 hour. Turn the heat down to 325 degrees F, and flip the turkey breast side up. Baste the turkey with the pan drippings, brushing off any onions or other bits that may be stuck to the breast. If the roasting pan is dry, add ½ cup of water to prevent the onions or the pan drippings from burning.
Roast the turkey for another 75-90 minutes, basting once or twice, until a meat thermometer inserted into the thigh reads 165-170 degrees F and any juices run clear (not pink). During this time, twist the turkey pan 180 degrees if the turkey is cooking unevenly (ovens vary and some do tend to have hot spots). If the top of the turkey starts to get too dark, place a large piece of foil loosely over the top of the turkey to protect it from burning.
Remove the turkey from the oven and let it rest for 15 minutes, covered loosely with foil. After this initial resting time, transfer the turkey to a cutting board or serving plate, keeping it tented with the foil.
Using a slotted spoon, remove any burnt bits or impurities from the roasting pan. Next, scoop out the onions and giblets, and transfer to a blender. If you don’t like giblets, you can alternatively shred the neck meat and add that to the blender, but this is totally optional if you want to serve the neck along with the turkey instead! Pour the remaining pan juices and fat into a large gravy separator and set aside.
It’s time to make the gravy. Blend the onions and giblets (or neck meat, if using) until smooth. In a saucepan over medium heat, add the turkey fat. You should have about a quarter cup of fat. If not, add enough butter to approximate ¼ cup of fat.
Whisk in ¼ cup all purpose flour to form a roux, and cook for about 3 minutes, whisking constantly. Turn the heat down if necessary to prevent burning.
Whisk in the paprika, the contents of the blender, and the juices from the roasting pan. Gravy isn’t an exact science––you’ll have to adjust according to how thick or thin you like your gravy! If the gravy still looks too thick, add more chicken stock until it reaches your desired consistency. Continue to simmer the gravy for about 2 minutes, whisking constantly.
At this point, add the dark soy sauce. This ingredient is mostly for color––I add as much as I need to get the rich color I’m looking for. Season the gravy with salt and pepper to taste.
By now, your turkey should be fully rested. Carve the turkey and serve with the gravy on the side.",en-US,"{'calories': '622 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '10 g', 'proteinContent': '85 g', 'fatContent': '25 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '8 g', 'cholesterolContent': '297 mg', 'fiberContent': '1 g', 'sugarContent': '3 g', 'servingSize': '1 serving'}",4.5,,The Woks of Life,870,12 serving(s)

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and place the duck on a foil lined sheet pan. Roast the duck for about 45 minutes and finish under the broiler to crisp the skin a bit. Once cooled, take the meat off the bone and shred it with a fork or just with your hands. Put about a tablespoon of hot water on the roasting pan and use a rubber spatula to deglaze it. Toss the meat in with the juices and duck fat (we don't play around here). If you're a little squeamish about the amount of duck fat on the pan, then drain some off before you deglaze it.

On a sheet pan, drizzle the chicken breasts with olive oil and sprinkle liberally with salt and black pepper.
Bake in the oven for 35-40 minutes. When the chicken breasts are done cooking, take them out of the oven to cool, and remove the meat from the bone, cutting the chicken into large chunks. You can save these bones for a small batch of stock or plan to cook the chicken further in advance so you can use the stock for the pot pie filling. If you decide to do the latter, simmer the bones in about 5 cups of water for a few hours.
While the chicken is cooking, prepare the pastry. Mix the flour, salt, and baking powder in the bowl of your food processor. Add the shortening and butter and pulse about 10 times, until the butter and shortening are the size of small peas.
With the food processor on, add the ice water--just enough for the dough to just come together. You may have to pause and give it a stir with your hands, as some portions of the dough will be wetter or dryer. Dump the dough onto a clean, floured surface and knead gently into a ball. No need to overwork the dough! Wrap it in plastic and transfer to the refrigerator to rest for 30 minutes.
Now, back to the filling. In a heavy-bottomed pot, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and onions, and cook until translucent. Next, add the carrots and cook for another 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Next, add the bell pepper and cook for about 3 minutes.
Add the butter, stirring to help it melt, and allowing the vegetables to cook further. When the butter is completely melted, turn down the heat to low, and add in ¾ cup of flour. Stir the flour and vegetable mixture constantly for 2 minutes.
Add the chicken stock, stirring thoroughly and breaking up lumps. Turn the heat back up to medium-high, so the sauce thickens and bubbles. When the sauce has a gravy-like consistency, add the frozen peas and diced chicken breast, followed by the heavy cream, parsley, and thyme. Simmer for an additional 5 minutes, and remove from the heat.

Choose your oven-safe vessels and fill with the chicken pot pie filling, leaving about an inch of clearance between the top line of the filling and the baking dish.

In a small pot, add your reserved chicken bones, 2 ½ cups water, and ginger. Bring to a boil and simmer over low heat for at least 1 hour (or longer). We’ll need 1 ½ cups of chicken broth for the recipe. You can also eliminate this step if you want to use store-bought chicken stock.
Rinse off your de-boned chicken and pat thoroughly dry with a paper towel. Grab 2 pieces of aluminum foil, each about 12” long. Lay each piece of chicken onto a piece of foil, and sprinkle with ¼ teaspoon salt. Roll up the chicken lengthwise, and then wrap in the foil, twisting both sides to form a candy-like bundle.
Steam the chicken in the foil over high heat for 20 minutes, covered. Turn off the heat and let the chicken sit in the steamer for another 5 minutes with the lid tightly closed.
Transfer the foil wrapped chicken to an ice bath, and let it sit there for 10-15 minutes, until the chicken is completely cool. This step ensures that the juices remain locked in and improves the chicken’s overall texture.
Now it’s time to make the brine. In a non-reactive container (I used a glass loaf pan. Anything narrow and deep, where the chicken can remain submerged, will work), add the 1 ½ cups chicken broth, 1 ½ cups shaoxing wine, sugar, salt, and goji berries. Once the chicken is cool, unwrap the chicken and place in the brine. Cover and refrigerate for 24 hours.v
Slice and serve cold or at room temperature. This dish is usually served as a cold appetizer. Remember to store the chicken in the brine until serving and use clean utensil whenever coming contact with the brine and chicken. Consume the chicken within 3 days.

Boil water in your wok and blanch the broccoli for 1 minute (or 2 minutes if you like your broccoli softer). Drain and set aside.
Clean and dry your wok. Place it over high heat until smoking. Add 2 tablespoons vegetable oil and sear the chicken until opaque on all sides (this shoul d only take about 3 minutes). Turn off the heat, remove the chicken, and set aside. The chicken will be about 90% done, but will be cooked again at the end.
Without washing the wok, set the flame to medium heat. Add another tablespoon of oil, along with the garlic and ginger (if using). Stir the garlic and ginger for 5 seconds and add the Shaoxing wine around the perimeter of the wok. Then pour in the sauce mixture. Use your wok spatula to stir the sauce around the sides of the wok to deglaze, and let it come to a simmer.
Stir up the cornstarch and water slurry and drizzle the mixture into sauce while stirring constantly. Allow the sauce to simmer for 10 to 15 seconds until thick and gravy-like.
Toss in the chicken and its juices and the blanched broccoli. Stir-fry until the chicken and broccoli is coated in the sauce.
At this point, you can make adjustments. If you like your brown sauce darker, add a dash more of dark soy sauce. Add more cornstarch slurry if your sauce is too thin, or more chicken stock or water if the sauce is too thick.

Make the batter by mixing all of the batter ingredients in a bowl until combined. Do not overmix! Meanwhile, heat 4 cups of canola oil in a small wok or cast-iron frying pan until it reaches 350 degrees F.

Next, flip the chicken and add the smashed ginger slices to the bottom of the pan. Let both sides of the ginger slices cook and caramelize in the oil for 1 to 2 minutes.
Next, add the garlic slices and white portions of the scallions. Let fry in the oil for a minute. Use a metal spatula to ensure the chicken is not stuck to the wok, but be gentle so as to not break up the chicken skin.

Use tongs or chopsticks to turn the chicken quarters and let cook for another 15 minutes. There should be quite a bit of sauce in the pan, but if things are looking dry, add a bit more chicken stock.
Next, uncover the chicken and add the green portions of the scallions. Cook uncovered to reduce the liquid until it just begins to coat a spoon. Use a meat thermometer to check to make sure the internal temperature of the chicken is 165 degrees F. Alternatively, you can just poke the thickest part of the chicken leg quarter with a fork--the juice should run clear. At this point, you can be the judge of how thick or thin you want your sauce to be, but the chicken should be done. Turn the heat up to reduce the sauce if you like yours on the thicker side.

For the marinade, combine the salt, sugar, garlic, thyme, oregano, sage, basil, paprika, black pepper, olive oil, and butter in a small bowl. Toss the carrots, celery and onion together in a medium-sized roasting pan. Be sure to use a roasting pan that you can place on the stovetop.
Pour 1 tablespoon of the marinade onto the mirepoix mixture (that’s the carrots, onions, and celery), and toss until the marinade is incorporated. Place the turkey breast in the roasting pan and spread the rest of the marinade over the turkey breast, coating the entire surface area, including under the skin where you can reach it. Cover with plastic wrap and let the turkey marinate overnight in the refrigerator.
The next day, when you’re ready to cook your turkey, preheat your oven to 400 degrees and take the turkey out of the refrigerator to allow it to come back up to room temperature. Roast the turkey breast for about 35 minutes at 400 degrees. Baste the turkey in the pan juices, and add half a cup of water or chicken stock to the roasting pan if it looks dry.
Tent the breast with a piece of foil so it does not burn, and turn the temperature down to 350 degrees. Bake for another 40 minutes, or until a meat thermometer reads 160-165 degrees, and remove from the oven. Transfer the turkey breast to a cutting board to rest, leaving it covered in foil.
Now for the stuffing. Using a slotted spoon, carefully remove any congealed blood from the turkey pan and discard it. Yes, tis the reality of cooking meat! You can do this. Pour off any juices in the roasting pan into a fat separator (if your fat separator has one of those strainer attachments, you may be able to skip the skimming step). In short, you should only have the cooked carrots, celery, and onion in the roasting pan. Place it directly on the stove top over low to medium heat.
Stir the 1½ tablespoons of butter into the roasted vegetables along with the dried dill. Then add 1½ cups of the chicken stock/turkey drippings mixture to deglaze the pan.
Next, add the bread cubes to the pan, and toss the mixture until the bread soaks up all of the liquid. Cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. The stuffing may begin to stick to the bottom of the pan, so add the rest of your turkey drippings/chicken stock mixture to deglaze the pan again, followed by the fresh sage, flat-leaf parsley, thyme, and oregano. Season with salt and pepper to taste, and stir everything together until combined. Use a metal spatula to scrape the bottom of the pan so it does not stick and burn. Cook for another 5 minutes, and remove from the heat. Cover with foil until you are ready to serve.
Now it's time to make the gravy. Pour the turkey fat/olive oil mixture (it will likely be mostly olive oil, as a turkey breast doesn't yield a ton of fat) into a saucepan along with 1 tablespoon of butter. Heat over medium heat, and whisk in 1/3 cup of flour until all the flour is absorbed (about 1 minute) and creates a roux. Stir in the paprika and fresh ground black pepper and then gradually whisk in your turkey drippings and chicken stock mixture to form the gravy. Keep stirring until the gravy has a uniform consistency. Add one teaspoon of soy sauce and salt to taste. Next, whisk in the cornstarch mixture and let simmer for 30 seconds.",en-US,"{'calories': '605 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '24 g', 'proteinContent': '80 g', 'fatContent': '22 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '6 g', 'cholesterolContent': '200 mg', 'sodiumContent': '2066 mg', 'fiberContent': '3 g', 'sugarContent': '6 g', 'servingSize': '1 serving'}",5.0,,The Woks of Life,90,8 serving(s)

Mom's Chicken Wontons,Sarah,https://thewoksoflife.com/chicken-wontons/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/chicken-wontons-17.jpg,"['12 ounces napa cabbage ((340g))', '3/4 teaspoon salt', '10 shiitake mushrooms ((fresh or dried; 6 oz./170g fresh or 1.5 oz./42g dried))', '3 tablespoons oil', '1 pound boneless skinless chicken breast or thighs or ground chicken ((450g))', '2 teaspoons ginger ((finely minced))', '1/4 cup scallions ((finely chopped))', '2 tablespoons soy sauce', '1 1/2 tablespoons shaoxing wine ((or dry sherry cooking wine))', '1 tablespoon oyster sauce', '1 teaspoon sesame oil', '1 teaspoon sugar', '1/2 teaspoon white pepper', '5 teaspoons Knorr Chicken Powder ((20g))', '2 tablespoons water ((preferably from soaking the mushrooms or salting the cabbage))', '2 packages wonton wrappers ((about 75-80 wrappers total))']","Wash the napa cabbage clean and shake off any excess water. If using a food processor, tear the leaves up and pulse them into small pieces (take care not to mince the napa cabbage). If hand-chopping them, slice the leaves thinly lengthwise and then finely chop them going the other way. Transfer to a bowl and mix in ¾ teaspoon salt. Set aside for 30 minutes while you prepare the other ingredients (but no more than 30 minutes). After 30 minutes, squeeze the napa cabbage dry and save the water.
Pre-soak the mushrooms if using dried shiitake mushrooms (then squeeze any water from the mushrooms and reserve the soaking liquid––if using fresh mushrooms, skip this step). Remove the mushroom stems and dice them into ½” cubes.
Heat 3 tablespoons oil in a wok or pan over medium high heat, and cook the mushrooms for about 5-8 minutes until caramelized. Turn off the heat and leave the mushrooms to cool.
Now hand-chop the chicken by using our method for grinding meat without a grinder. This allows you to choose whatever cut of chicken you like (breast or thighs) and get a better texture than conventional ground meat. If you’d like to skip this step, you can also use ground chicken.
Time to make the filling: combine the chicken, napa cabbage, cooked mushrooms (with any oil left in the pan), ginger, scallions, light soy sauce, Shaoxing wine, oyster sauce, sesame oil, sugar, white pepper, Knorr Chicken Powder, and 2 tablespoons of liquid from either soaking the mushrooms or salting the cabbage (if you have neither, just use water).
Using a rubber spatula or pair of chopsticks, stir the mixture in one direction for 10 minutes, longer if needed, until the filling is well combined and sticky, like a paste.
Prepare a large sheet pan lined with parchment paper and get a small bowl of room temperature water. Lastly, bring a small pot of water to a boil, so you can taste­ test a couple wontons.
To assemble the wontons, take your square wonton wrapper, wet your finger, and dab one side of the square with water. Add 1-2 teaspoons of filling in the center, and gently fold the wrapper in half. Seal on all sides. Using your finger, brush another dab of water on one corner (of the filling side), and gently overlap the two corners of the rectangle by pressing them together. Place on the parchment-­lined sheet pan.
Make one more wonton, boil, and taste test the two samples (we find that tasting two, and not just one, helps us get a better feel for the flavor and adjust seasoning more accurately). Make adjustments to taste before proceeding to make the whole batch.
To cook the wontons, boil water in a pot, and add the wontons (fresh or frozen, but never defrosted wontons). To prevent the wontons from sticking to the bottom of the pot, stir the boiling water gently so the water is moving when you add in the wontons. Cook uncovered for abou 5 minutes using medium heat. If necessary, add ½ cup cold water if the water is boiling too vigorously. This helps manage the starch levels in the water. The wontons are done once they float to the surface and turn slightly plump. (Cooking frozen wontons takes longer, about 8 minutes.)",en-US,"{'calories': '288 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '38 g', 'proteinContent': '17 g', 'fatContent': '7 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '1 g', 'cholesterolContent': '35 mg', 'sodiumContent': '865 mg', 'fiberContent': '2 g', 'sugarContent': '1 g', 'servingSize': '1 serving'}",5.0,,The Woks of Life,195,10 serving(s)

Place in a large mixing bowl. Sprinkle the salt and pepper over the wings and mix thoroughly with your hands. This helps the seasoning really adhere to the chicken.
Let marinate in the refrigerator for at least 5 hours. If you let them marinate overnight, all the better! When the wings are done marinating, fire up your grill. Let it get pretty hot--if your grill has one of those fancy thermometers, let it get all the way up to max heat.
Grilling is a rather inexact science, so let your resident grillmaster handle these. I'm happy to say that in recent years, I've very nearly usurped my dad--at least when it comes to wings! If you're a grilling novice and need a few more tips, though, here's how I cook them:
Place the wings on the grill, topside down. After about 3-5 minutes, you can turn them 90 degrees to brown them evenly. Close the grill to let them cook through as well. Though you should only close the grill for 45-60 seconds at a time, as grease flare-ups can occur pretty easily with wings. When the top of the wing is thoroughly grilled (you'll know it by the golden, lightly crisped and charred skin), flip the wings. Lower the heat to medium/medium high, and repeat these steps until the wings are cooked through, periodically closing the grill to let them cook through. Some wings will cook faster than others, so you can place those on indirect heat while the rest finish up.",en-US,"{'calories': '319 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '1 g', 'proteinContent': '26 g', 'fatContent': '23 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '6 g', 'cholesterolContent': '110 mg', 'sodiumContent': '880 mg', 'fiberContent': '1 g', 'sugarContent': '1 g', 'servingSize': '1 serving'}",5.0,,The Woks of Life,320,6 serving(s)

Easy Peking Duck with Mandarin Pancakes,Bill,https://thewoksoflife.com/easy-peking-duck-mandarin-pancakes/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/peking-duck-recipe-11-1.jpg,"['4 boneless duck breasts ((about 6-7 oz./170-200g each with the skin on; rinsed and thoroughly patted dry with a paper towel))', '1/4 teaspoon salt', '1 teaspoon light soy sauce', '1 teaspoon Shaoxing wine', '1/8 teaspoon five spice powder', '1 tablespoon oil', '1 1/2 cups flour', '1/8 teaspoon salt', '2/3 cup boiling water', '1 teaspoon oil', '1 cucumber ((de-seeded and julienned))', '1/2 cup cantaloupe ((julienned, optional))', '2 scallions ((julienned))', '3 cloves garlic ((finely minced and mixed with 1 teaspoon oil to make a paste, optional))', '3 tablespoons hoisin sauce']","Marinate the duck:
Mix the salt, soy sauce, wine, and five spice powder in a small bowl and massage into the duck. Leave the duck breasts skin side up on a plate uncovered, and let sit in the refrigerator overnight to marinate and to let the skin dry out. (If you don't want to wait overnight, reduce the marinating time to 30 minutes).
Prepare mandarin pancakes:
Mix the flour and salt in a heatproof bowl. Pour the boiling hot water into the flour mixture and use chopsticks or a spatula to mix until a dough ball forms. Once it is cool enough to handle, knead the dough for 8 minutes until smooth, adding flour if the dough is too sticky. Cover with plastic and allow the dough to rest at room temperature for at least 1 hour.
Roll the dough into a cylinder and cut into 12 equal pieces. Form each piece into a dough ball, then flatten them out into a small disc about 2 inches in diameter. Lightly brush 6 of the discs with oil, ensuring the sides of the discs are also brushed with oil. Layer the remaining 6 discs over the 6 oiled discs so you have 6 pieces, each comprised of 2 discs.
Use a rolling pin to roll the discs into 7-inch circles, flipping the pancakes frequently so both of the dough discs are rolled into the same size.
Heat a wok or frying pan over medium low heat, and place one pancake into the pan. After 30 to 45 seconds, you should see air pockets begin to form between the two pancakes. Flip the pancake; it should be white with just a couple of faint brown patches. Any more than that, and they are overcooked. After another 30 seconds, the air pockets should be large enough to separate the two pancakes. Remove the pancake to a plate, and let it cool for another 30 seconds. Now carefully pull apart the two pancakes at the seams. Place finished pancakes onto a plate and cover with a warm kitchen towel. Repeat until all pancakes are done.
The pancakes can be reheated in a steamer for about a minute when ready to serve. They also keep in the freezer for up to 3 weeks if you decide to make a larger batch.
Cook the duck and assemble:
Next, preheat the oven broiler on low heat. Heat an oven-proof pan over medium-high heat, and add 1 tablespoon of oil to coat the pan.
Sear the duck breasts, skin side down, for 6-8 minutes. Move them frequently so the skin crisps up and fries in the duck fat that renders out. Turn the heat down to medium if needed.
After 6-8 minutes, or when the duck skin is a bit crispy and dark golden brown, carefully drain off the duck fat and discard (or save for later application to other recipes!). Flip the duck breasts (so they are skin side up), and transfer them to the broiler for about 3 minutes. Be careful not to burn the skin, which at this point should be a bit crispy.
Remove the duck from the broiler and let rest for 10 to 15 minutes. The duck will be cooked about medium well and will be very juicy. Transfer to a cutting board and, using a sharp knife, cut into thin slices.
Serve the duck with your warmed pancakes, fixings, and sauce.",en-US,"{'calories': '539 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '46 g', 'proteinContent': '51 g', 'fatContent': '15 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '3 g', 'cholesterolContent': '174 mg', 'sodiumContent': '634 mg', 'fiberContent': '2 g', 'sugarContent': '6 g', 'servingSize': '1 serving'}",4.92,,The Woks of Life,745,4 serving(s)

Use your hands to tear the green vegetables lengthwise into manageable pieces and set aside.
Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the fresh or dried noodles. For fresh noodles, boil for 30 seconds to a minute. For dried, it’ll take a little longer. Cook until they’re just softened. Be careful not to overcook them, or they’ll be soggy! Rinse with cold water, drain, and set aside.
In a small bowl, combine the oyster sauce, soy sauce, sesame oil, sugar, salt, white pepper, and hot chicken stock. In another bowl, mix the 2 tablespoons of cornstarch and 2 tablespoons water into a slurry and set aside. To go over what you’ve prepared so far: the marinated chicken, the washed and trimmed veggies, the cooked noodles, the sauce mix, and the cornstarch slurry. I know it seems like a lot of prep, but the dish really does come together quickly!
Heat your wok over high heat and add 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, making sure to swirl it around to coat the sides. Spread out your noodles in an even layer and fry for about 3 minutes, or until golden and crisp. Flip the noodles over and fry the other side (you can add a bit more oil if necessary). If preheated properly, the noodles should not stick to the wok. With practice, you’ll be able to flip all the noodles in one shot! If you’re not feeling lucky, then just flip it in small sections. When the noodles are golden on both sides, transfer the noodles to a large round plate.
Next, heat the wok until just smoking and add another tablespoon of vegetable oil. Sear the chicken breast. Once browned, add the garlic and then the Shaoxing wine to deglaze the pan. Pour in your sauce. Now you get why I said hot chicken stock, since I doubt you have a 50 thousand BTU roaring flame beneath your wok! Our dinky little Beijing flame isn’t the best either. Let the liquid come to a boil and add your green vegetables. Stir and cook for about a minute.
Stir up your slurry mixture again, since the cornstarch probably settled to the bottom of the bowl. Once the liquid is boiling, add about 2/3 of the cornstarch and stir the mixture to thicken. Add more slurry until the sauce thickens enough to coat a spoon. How thick you like your sauce it is also about personal preference. Allow to bubble up for another 30 seconds or so.

Add the lemongrass, cilantro (coriander), shallots, and garlic to a mortar and pestle, and pound until pulverized. You can also use a food processor for this step.
Add the oil, sugar, salt, black pepper, Thai soy sauces, fish sauce and turmeric (if using). Mix until well-combined.
You can butterfly or spatchcock your chicken for grilling like it’s done on the streets of Thailand. However, I cut the chicken into individual pieces to ensure they’d cook properly. This way, I can pull each piece off the grill once cooked. Rub the chicken with the marinade paste, ensuring every piece is thoroughly coated. Cover and place in the refrigerator to marinate overnight (or at least 12 hours).
The next day, take the chicken out 1 to 2 hours before you’re ready to grill.
Make the sauce:
In a small bowl, mix the sugar and hot water until the sugar is dissolved. Mix in the rest of the sauce ingredients and set aside.
Cook the chicken:
Place the chicken on the grill, and use any remaining marinade to baste the chicken while grilling. Leave the marinade paste on the chicken, including any chunks of herbs as they will caramelize and add flavor. Turn and baste the chicken often to create a nice flavorful outer crust. Baste the chicken with the leftover marinade in the first half of the grilling process, but do not do this towards the end of cooking. The raw chicken marinade needs enough time to fully cook.

In the meantime, add the salt and Sichuan peppercorns to a flat-bottomed pan over medium heat. Dry roast them by stirring constantly for 5-8 minutes until the salt turns slightly yellow. Turn off the heat and let cool. Be sure not to burn the Sichuan peppercorns.
Drain the duck from the water and thoroughly pat it dry with paper towels, inside and out. Rub the salt and Sichuan peppercorns all over the duck, inside and out. Use all of the mixture, making sure that you use at least 1/3 for the cavity. Let the duck marinate, uncovered, for three hours in the refrigerator.
While the duck is marinating, you can prepare your spice pouch. Place the star anise, cumin seeds, bay leaves, cinnamon, and peppercorns on a square of cheesecloth and tie tightly with kitchen twine. Set aside.
Next, prepare a pot that is big enough to cook the duck whole. Fill it with 12-15 cups of water, enough to submerge the whole duck. Add the spice pouch along with the ginger and scallion. Bring the pot of water to a boil, and add the Shaoxing wine. Simmer over low heat.
Once the duck is finished marinating, carefully lower it (along with all the salt and Sichuan peppercorns used to marinate it) in the prepared pot. Bring to a boil.

Starting with a partially frozen bird is majorly bad juju.
Get your goose ready for roasting by removing the giblets and neck from the cavity. Use a sharp knife to trim any large pads of fat from the inside. Give the goose a really thorough rinse (including the cavity), and pat dry. Do not remove the flap of skin at the neck, just tuck it underneath the goose to keep it sealed.
If the goose is trussed, remove the string and pull out the legs and wings slightly, which will help with more even cooking. Place the goose in a foil-lined roasting pan. You definitely want there to be a sizeable rim around the pan, as the goose will release a lot of fat as it cooks.
Zest the oranges and mix the zest with 1½ teaspoons salt, pepper, sugar, five spice powder, shaoxing wine (or sherry), and soy sauce. Set aside.
Season the goose cavity with salt, and rub the minced garlic all throughout the cavity as well. Stuff the ginger slices and scallions into the cavity, along with the zested oranges, cut into quarters.
Rub the orange zest and five-spice mixture all over the goose, and set it aside for 30 minutes (you can also marinate it overnight for optimum results). During this time, preheat your oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Place the goose in the oven and cook for 10 minutes at 450 degrees F/230 degrees C. Reduce the heat to 350 degrees F (190 degrees C) and cook for another 10-12 minutes per pound (about 1 hour and 45 minutes to 2 hours for a 10-pound goose. If your goose is larger, increase the cooking time accordingly). Feel free to adjust cooking times depending on your desired doneness, but don’t dry it out! When a meat thermometer in the thigh reads 165-170 degrees F, it’s done.
Every 30 minutes, baste the bird with the fat in the pan. About halfway through cooking, tent the breast loosely with foil and spoon out 3 tablespoons of goose fat.
Take this fat and toss it on a roasting pan with the potatoes, salt, pepper, and your choice of herbs—thyme, rosemary, whatever. Throw those into the oven with the goose in its last half hour and roast.
Once the goose is done roasting, take it out of the oven and cover with foil. Give the potatoes a stir and crank the heat up to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C) to finish roasting. Let the goose rest for 20 minutes while the potatoes finish cooking.

Add the shredded chicken to the scallion and onion mixture along with the chopped cilantro, lime juice, lime zest, and salt and pepper, to taste. Stir to combine.

Set aside ½ cup of pineapple juice from your can of pineapple, and reserve ⅔ cup of the pineapple chunks (if using). Set aside.
Combine the hot water, salt, sugar, and ketchup. Stir until the salt and sugar are dissolved, and then add the vinegar and pineapple juice (if using). If not using pineapple juice, replace with ½ cup water or chicken stock. Set aside.
Marinate the chicken:
Experts are recommending that it's not necessary to wash your chicken before cutting and cooking it (thanks to Judy, one of our readers for pointing this out). If you decide to wash the chicken like I do sometimes (depends on the state of the chicken), be very careful about splashing water and contaminating surfaces with unwanted bacteria. If you do rinse your chicken, don’t worry about patting it dry, as you need water in the marinade—if your chicken is relatively dry / drained, add 1 tablespoon of water.
Cut your chicken into uniform 1 inch chunks (for even cooking) and place into a bowl. Add the garlic and onion powders, sesame oil, white pepper and salt. Mix until all pieces are uniformly coated, and let it sit for 5 minutes. Any excess water should be fully absorbed by the chicken. If not, mix the chicken again and let it sit for another 5 minutes.
Make the batter:
Mix together the all-purpose flour, cornstarch, baking powder, and baking soda in a bowl, and add 2/3 cup of ice water. Use a fork to mix until a batter is formed, and stir in 1 tablespoon of oil. Set aside.
Fry the chicken:
The amount of oil you need depends on the size of the pot you will use. Using a larger pot uses more oil, but allows you to cook the chicken in fewer batches. Using a smaller pot uses less oil, but you’ll have to fry more batches of chicken. We usually go for a smaller pot, so we have less leftover oil. Heat the oil in a small pot until it reaches 335 degrees F. I
Place 5 to 6 pieces of marinated chicken into the batter. Use a chopstick, fork, or your fingers to coat the chicken in the batter and place each piece slowly into the oil.
Use a slotted spoon to carefully turn the chicken so all sides are uniformly fried. Fry for about 2 minutes, or until the batter is a light golden brown and crispy. Remove with a slotted spoon and let any excess oil drain off before placing onto a rack or paper towel lined plate.
Assemble in the Wok:
Heat 1 tablespoon canola oil in a wok over medium high heat, and add the red onion and peppers. Stir-fry for 30 seconds.
Next, add the sweet and sour sauce you prepared earlier and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat so the sauce is simmering.
Stir up your cornstarch slurry until it is uniform. While stirring the sweet and sour sauce, drizzle the slurry into the sauce. The sauce should be thick enough to coat a spoon. Turn down the heat and give the sauce a quick taste––now is the time to add more salt, vinegar or sugar if desired.
Add the pineapple chunks (if using) and stir until warmed through. Now is the time to refry the chicken to make them nice and crispy. Heat the oil up to 335 degrees F and fry the chicken in two batches for about 45 seconds each time and they will crisp right up again. Then add the chicken pieces to your sauce, and gently toss with your wok spatula until the chicken is coated.

Make sure you provide plenty of time for this step. It’s best to let your turkey thaw overnight in the kitchen sink a couple of days before Thanksgiving (if it’s frozen solid) or the day before you’re going to cook it (preferably the morning, as it will still need to marinate). When the turkey is completely thawed, remove it from the wrapper, and if the inside of the turkey is still frozen, run some warm water into the cavity and let it sit for a few more hours to thaw. If you’re in a hurry, you can soak the turkey in lukewarm water to aid the thawing process.
This is the single most important step to ensuring your turkey cooks evenly. Be sure to also remove the giblet package in the cavity and thoroughly rinse the cavity and outside of the turkey. Next, drain all of the water from the cavity, and pat the whole turkey dry with paper towels. You can also let it drip dry on a rack.
Make the marinade by mixing together ¼ cup ground bean sauce, 3 tablespoons hoisin sauce, 4 teaspoons minced garlic, 1 tablespoon finely minced shallot, 2 teaspoons minced fresh ginger, 1½ tablespoons salt, 3 tablespoons Shaoxing wine, and 1 teaspoon five spice powder.
Rub the turkey down inside and out with the marinade, ensuring all surfaces are thoroughly coated. Work the marinade under the skin where possible. If you think you have too much marinade, use the surplus amount in the cavity. Finish the turkey by placing the Chinese dried tangerine peels into the cavity.
Place the turkey in a roasting pan, cover it with plastic wrap, and refrigerate overnight. The next day, take the turkey out 3 hours prior to roasting to bring it up to room temperature.
When you’re ready to cook the turkey, line the roasting pan with the 3 pounds of chopped potatoes and the chopped leek. Place the turkey on top of the vegetables, breast side down. (We’re going to flip it later).
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F, and arrange an oven rack in the lower third of the oven. While that’s happening, prepare the glaze. Mix together ⅓ cup hot water, 2 teaspoons red Zhejiang vinegar, and 3 tablespoons of honey. Set aside.
Roast your Cantonese turkey for 30 minutes. Then use a basting brush to glaze the turkey with your honey mixture and rotate the pan 180 degrees. Roast for another 30 minutes, and give the turkey another basting with the glaze.
Remove the turkey from the oven, and lower the temperature to 325 degrees F. Using a clean kitchen towel and a sturdy roasting fork, flip the turkey breast-side up. Carefully brush off any vegetables that may be stuck to the turkey, taking care not to damage the skin on the breast.
Roast the turkey at the lower temperature for another hour and 5 minutes (for a 13 pound turkey) to an hour and a half (for a 15 pound turkey). Glaze the turkey every 15 minutes, and rotate the pan halfway through the second block of roasting time. If the turkey is browning too much, tent it lightly with aluminum foil.
The surest way to check if your turkey is cooked through is to use a meat thermometer. The internal temperature of the thigh should register 165 degrees and the juices should run clear (not pink).
When your turkey is done, transfer it to a serving plate, cover it lightly with aluminum foil, and let it rest for 20 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to scoop the potatoes and leeks out of the pan. Serve them as-is, or make them into a delicious side of roasted mashed potatoes (just add milk, butter, and salt to taste). Lastly, pour the pan drippings through a fine mesh strainer into a fat separator to make the gravy.",en-US,"{'calories': '635 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '22 g', 'proteinContent': '85 g', 'fatContent': '22 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '6 g', 'cholesterolContent': '271 mg', 'sodiumContent': '971 mg', 'fiberContent': '3 g', 'sugarContent': '5 g', 'servingSize': '1 serving'}",4.86,,The Woks of Life,215,12 serving(s)

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F and place a rack in the lower third position of your oven. Spread the onions and carrots evenly in your roasting pan.
Take the chicken out of the refrigerator and allow it to sit at room temperature for about 2 hours. If the chicken is cold, it will be difficult to cook it evenly. Remove the chicken giblets and rinse the chicken inside and out. Pat the chicken thoroughly dry with paper towels, and season the cavity liberally with salt and pepper. Then combine the melted butter and olive oil with an additional 2 ½ teaspoons of salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Rub this mixture all over the outside of the chicken, as well as under the skin where you can get it.
Put the thyme inside the cavity, along with the lemon and garlic halves. Tie the legs together with kitchen string, and place the chicken on top of the bed of carrots and onions, breast-side up.
Roast for 75-85 minutes, or until the juices run clear when you cut between the leg and thigh.
Remove the chicken and vegetables to a platter and cover with aluminum foil for about 20 minutes. Slice the chicken, and serve it with the vegetables. Reserve the pan drippings for the stock.

Once you’re done eating the chicken, remove the lemon halves, thyme and garlic that you roasted the chicken with. Add the chicken carcass to a stockpot. You can also add any leftover roasted vegetables you may have.
Take half of your warm water and pour it into your roasting pan. Use a spoon to lift up all the bits from the bottom of the pan, and pour the liquid from the pan into your stockpot.
Add the additional 6 cups water, carrots, celery, onion, garlic, peppercorns, and bay leaves. Bring to a boil, and then reduce the heat to low. Cover. Allow the stock to simmer for about 6-8 hours, periodically skimming any foam off the surface.

Next, combine the hot water, sugar, soy sauces and white pepper in a small bowl. This is the sauce that you’ll be adding to the rice, and it’s much easier to have it combined and ready to go before you start cooking. If you have questions about light and dark soy sauce, be sure to check out our Chinese sauces, vinegar, and oils ingredient page.
Take your cooked rice and fluff it with a fork or with your hands (you can rinse your hands in cold water if the rice starts sticking to them). If you are using cold leftover rice, try to break up the clumps as best as possible.
Heat the wok over medium high heat and add 1 tablespoon of oil. Add the eggs and scramble them until just done. You can even start scooping them up when they look like they are almost done and set aside. They will continue to cook in the bowl and you will cook them again in the rice. I'm only harping on this because you don’t want dried egg bits in your chicken fried rice!
Heat the wok until just smoking and spread another tablespoon oil around your wok. Sear the marinated chicken in one layer for 20 seconds. Stir-fry the chicken until about 80% done. Remove the chicken to your marinade bowl and set aside.
With the wok over medium high heat, add another tablespoon of oil and sauté the onions until translucent. Add the rice, and use your metal spatula to flatten out and break up any large clumps. If the rice is cold from the refrigerator, continue stir-frying until the rice is warmed up, which will take about 5 minutes. Sprinkling just a little water on large clumps of rice will help break them up more easily. If the rice was made fresh, cooking time will be faster. Just make sure that the rice isn't too wet––which will make frying it difficult.
Once the rice is warmed (very important or the sauce will not mix as well and the color of the rice will not be as uniform), add the sauce mixture and mix with a scooping motion until the rice is evenly coated with sauce. You will have to break up any remaining clumps of rice with the spatula as best as possible, but no need to be obsessive. The rice should be hot by this time. Now add the chicken and any juices from the bowl you set aside earlier and stir fry for another minute.
Add the eggs, bean sprouts, and scallions, and continue stir-frying the rice for another 30 seconds. Then gather all of the rice into the middle of the wok to let the sides of the wok heat up. After about 20 seconds, spread the Shaoxing wine around the perimeter of the wok and stir-fry for another 20 seconds.

In a small saucepan over low heat, add the oil. Throw in the scallion pieces, star anise, and Sichuan peppercorns. Keep the pan over low heat for about 10 minutes, until fragrant. Pick out all the spices, so you essentially have a pot full of spiced oil. Stir in the flour and five-spice powder to create a thin roux. Set it aside, and let it cool completely.
Make the dough:
In a mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the flour and add the boiling water. Mix with a fork or a pair of chopsticks. Gradually add the cold water and knead everything together to form a smooth dough ball. Cover with a damp cloth and let it rest for 30 minutes.
Assembly:
Depending on the pancake size you want, divide the dough into 4-8 equal pieces. Lightly brush some oil on a clean work surface. Roll each piece of dough into a long rope, and then use a rolling pin to roll it flat. Brush a thin layer of the roux all over the dough, and then sprinkle it sparingly with sesame seeds, chopped scallion, and salt.
Start on one end and roll the dough up. Stand the roll upright and press it down with your palm. Lightly roll out the resulting circle until you get a pancake that’s between 1/4-1/2” thick. It’s ok of the outer edges break open a bit. Repeat for each pancake.
At this point, you can cook them, or freeze them by separating each pancake with a layer of plastic wrap or wax paper, and then putting them in a freezer bag. There’s no need for thawing when you want to cook them.
To cook the pancakes:
Heat a pan over medium heat and add a tablespoon or two of oil. Place the pancake in the pan. Once the bottom starts to turn a little golden, add two teaspoons of water to the sides of the pan (don’t pour the water on the pancake), and immediately cover with a lid. Cook 3 minutes. Uncover the pan, flip the pancake, and do the same steps with the other side.
To finish, uncover the lid again, turn up the heat slightly, and brown both sides while flipping the pancake occasionally. When it’s golden brown, use a pair of chopsticks to squeeze and pinch the pancake a couple times to loosen the layers (this step is optional), because you ideally want to see the layers when you hand-pull it apart. The cooked pancake should be crispy and slightly chewy.",en-US,"{'calories': '430 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '68 g', 'proteinContent': '10 g', 'fatContent': '13 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '1 g', 'sodiumContent': '299 mg', 'fiberContent': '4 g', 'sugarContent': '1 g', 'servingSize': '1 serving'}",5.0,,The Woks of Life,55,4 serving(s)

Bring to a boil and simmer over low heat for 1 hour until the chicken is falling off the bone. Set the chicken aside and strain the water (now turned into stock!) into a large bowl.
While the chicken is cooking, heat the 2 tbsp. of vegetable oil in a sauté pan. Add the okra and sauté over medium high heat until the “ropiness” is gone (i.e the goopy strands of okra-ness). When the okra is done, turn off the heat and set it aside.
Now comes the important step of making the signature gumbo roux. In the large pot you initially used for the chicken, add 2/3 cup vegetable oil and 3/4 cup flour. Whisk constantly for 20 minutes. Start with medium-low heat, and as it turns darker, switch to low heat. The roux should be a dark caramel color.
When you’ve got the perfect color for your roux, add the onion, bell pepper, celery, and garlic to the pot. Sauté them until tender, coating everything in that roux. This can take a bit of time, as you want the heat still around medium or medium-low to make sure the roux doesn’t burn.
When the veggies are tender, add the sliced sausage. Once the sausage is lightly browned, add the sautéed okra, and the tomatoes. Cook for 15 minutes. This is a good time to remove the skin and bone from the chicken thighs and roughly shred them with your hands or two forks.
Add the chicken stock and shredded chicken and stir until combined. Then, season the entire mixture with the bay leaves, thyme, basil, cayenne pepper, paprika, salt, and pepper. Mix thoroughly and bring to a low boil. Simmer for 1 hour with the pot loosely covered, stirring occasionally. After an hour, add the hot sauce and adjust seasoning if needed.

Heat your oil in pan over low heat, and add the scallions, ginger, garlic, star anise, cinnamon stick, and Sichuan peppercorns. Allow these aromatics to slowly infuse into the oil, until everything is kind of browned and wrinkly and fragrant. Discard the spices and pour the hot infused oil into the peanut mixture. Give everything a stir and cover the bowl with a plate to seal everything inside. Walk away and don't come back until everything else is ready!
Step 2:
Bring a medium pot of water to a boil (there should be enough water to submerge the chicken) along with the ginger and scallion. Once it's boiling, add the chicken (once it's added the water will probably stop boiling because of the temperature change).
Bring the water to a boil again, and after a minute, cover the pot and immediately turn off the heat. Let it sit on the stove for 20 minutes to slowly poach the chicken. In the meantime, prepare a small ice bath for chicken. After 20 minutes, take the chicken out of the pot and plunge it in the ice bath and let the chicken cool completely. Slice the chicken and place it on your serving plate.
Step 3:
Mix all of the Step 3 ingredients in a bowl. Now combine the mixture you just made with the peanut mixture you made in Step 1. Pour as much as you want over the chicken. We put about 2/3 of the mixture over the chicken and used the rest for a cold noodle lunch the next day (a highly recommended action!).",en-US,"{'calories': '448 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '13 g', 'proteinContent': '17 g', 'fatContent': '38 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '6 g', 'cholesterolContent': '71 mg', 'sodiumContent': '923 mg', 'fiberContent': '4 g', 'sugarContent': '2 g', 'servingSize': '1 serving'}",-1.0,,The Woks of Life,50,4 serving(s)
"Salt Baked Chicken, A Hakka Favorite (盐焗鸡)",Judy,https://thewoksoflife.com/salt-baked-chicken/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/salt-baked-chicken-3-1.jpg,"['A whole chicken ((about 3 pounds, 1.35 kg))', '2 tablespoons Shaoxing wine', '1½ tablespoons sand ginger powder', '½ teaspoon ground white pepper', '2 teaspoons coarse sea salt ((plus 3 pounds; yes, you read that right))', '4 slices ginger', '1 tablespoon oil']","Rinse the chicken under cold running water. Shake off the excess water and pat the chicken dry with paper towels or a clean dish cloth.
Brush the Shaoxing wine all over the chicken, including the cavity. Next, combine the sand ginger powder, ground white pepper, and 2 teaspoons salt. Rub the mixture all over the chicken, including the cavity.
Now set the chicken on a wire rack, and place it over a tray to catch any drippings. It’s best if you can sit the chicken upright so the liquid in its cavity can drip out. You can use a drinking glass to prop it up. Leave the chicken uncovered and let marinate overnight in the refrigerator. The objective is to dry out the chicken skin.
The next day, take the chicken out of the refrigerator for at least one to two hours before cooking, so the chicken can come up to room temperature. Insert the ginger slices into the cavity and brush the chicken skin with oil. Next, tie up the drumsticks with kitchen twine. Finally, wrap the chicken with a large piece of parchment paper, then wrap it again with a second piece of parchment with the opening on the breast side. Set the chicken aside.
Now “stir-fry” the rest of the salt in a clean dry wok for about 15 minutes, using medium heat until the salt turns light brown. The salt gets very hot, so be careful not to burn yourself or stir too vigorously. Next, fill a wok or Dutch oven with about a ½-inch of hot salt spread evenly across the bottom. Position the chicken with the breast side up in the center of the pot. Next, add the rest of the hot salt onto the chicken to make sure it’s completely covered. Top your vessel of choice with the lid, and cook over medium heat for 35 minutes. Then turn off the heat, and let it sit on the stove, covered, for another 30 to 40 minutes until the salt is warm to the touch.
Once the salt is warm to the touch, use a wooden spoon or a spatula to carefully lift the chicken out of the salt. Be very careful--the chicken is still very hot despite sitting with the heat off for 30-40 minutes. Carefully unwrap the parchment paper, and let it cool slightly until it’s not too hot to handle.
As for how to serve the chicken, this dish is usually served with the meat deboned and pulled apart. You don’t have to follow these steps, but your diners (in our case, Sarah) will appreciate your effort! Plus, the chicken bone and carcass do make a lovely broth. As you pull the meat off the chicken, there will be a lot of juice--do yourself and your diners a favor by pouring the juice over the chicken after it’s plated!

"Chinese Fried Pigeon (Squab), A Hong Kong Favorite",Bill,https://thewoksoflife.com/chinese-fried-pigeon-squab/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/fried-pigeon-13.jpg,"['2 whole squab', '3 ⅛-inch thick ginger slices', '3 cloves garlic ((smashed))', '1 scallion ((cut into large pieces and smashed))', '10 g rock sugar ((or granulated sugar))', '3 tablespoons salt', '¼ cup Shaoxing wine', '¼ cup light soy sauce', '1 Chinese spice packet for braising', '8 cups water ((enough to cover the squab))', '2 tablespoons maltose', '¼ cup Chinese red vinegar', '⅓ cup water', '1 teaspoon Shaoxing wine', '6 cups canola oil ((for frying))', 'Shrimp Chips - Ha Peen ((Optional))', 'Lemon wedges', 'Dipping salt ((a few pinches of five spice powder mixed with 1½ teaspoons salt))']","Make sure the pigeon/squab are cleaned well, removing any internal organs. Squab in the US almost always come frozen, and oftentimes, they only come dressed on the outside, which means that you must cut a small opening near the tail in order to remove the remove the organs and clean the inside.
Take care to cut a small opening, and not to rip the skin when cleaning it. The best cut to make is a small horizontal cut 1 to 1½ inches wide between the tail and the bottom of the breast. It’s the same place where all poultry are cut and cleaned out. Once the cut is made, you’ll have to carefully use two fingers to pull out the entrails--including the heart, gizzard, liver, lungs and any glands that are attached to the cavity. It will take a few passes and lots of rinsing with cold water to get them cleaned out.
After the insides are thoroughly cleaned, use kitchen shears to clip off the talons and tuck the feet inside the cavity. You can also just cut off the claws (some old folks like to eat them with a cold beer) and just leave the legs. For a Chinese New Year bird, Chinese people tend to leave the legs, tail, and head intact. It is an old Chinese tradition to serve any bird with both the head and tail on for Chinese New Year dinner. It’s true also for the classic poached chicken, Cantonese white cut chicken, which is a required dish at all Cantonese Lunar New Year dinners!
In a medium-sized pot, add the ginger, garlic, scallions, sugar, salt, Shaoxing wine, soy sauce, Chinese spice packet, water, and bring to a boil. The liquid should be quite salty––almost as salty as the sea, like when you cook pasta. Turn the heat down and let the sauce simmer for 15 minutes.
Next, carefully place the squab into the pot until they are fully submerged, and the cavities are filled with the hot liquid. Lift the squab out, emptying the liquid inside the cavity and return them back to the pot, again ensuring there are no air pockets in the cavity. This is the same method used in our classic Cantonese poached chicken; it ensures that there are no cold spots and that the poultry cooks evenly.
Reduce the heat to the lowest setting so the liquid is almost (but not actually) simmering. Let the squab cook for 30 minutes. Another easier method is to let the liquid simmer for 5 minutes with the squab, then turn off the heat completely, and leave the pot covered on the stove for another 25 minutes.
While the squab is cooking, prepare a large bowl of cold water. After the squab are done, remove them from the braising liquid, and soak them in the cold water, gently rubbing off any impurities from the skin that may have appeared from the cooking process. Let them cool completely in the water.
While the squab are cooling in the water, mix together the maltose, red vinegar, water, and Shaoxing wine until the maltose is dissolved. Maltose is not an easy ingredient to handle. It’s quite stiff and has the texture of taffy. Use your hand to remove the maltose from the measuring spoon and rub it into the water and vinegar mixture to help it dissolve.
Remove the squab from the water, gently shaking off any excess liquid. Roll the pigeon in the maltose vinegar mixture, using your hands to ensure all of the surface area gets coated. Do your best to keep the vinegar and maltose solution on the outside of the pigeon only. This maltose vinegar bath gives the skin a light coating that ensures crispy skin during the frying process.
Once the pigeons are thoroughly marinated, set aside, and air dry for a total of 2 hours. If you have a fan, point one at the birds to speed up the drying process. Turn the pigeons over after 1 hour and use a towel to wipe any liquid from the plate so it is dry. This bath and drying process is another measure to ensure that your traditional fried pigeon dish will have a crispy skin.
Now it’s time to fry the squab. Heat 6 cups of canola oil to 350 degrees F in a small wok. Use a thermometer to ensure the temperature is accurate. Usually, I recommend a small pot for deep frying to save oil, but in this case, it’s best to use a small round bottomed wok for frying.
Once your oil has come up to temperature, place one of the squab on the Chinese spider strainer breast down, and carefully lower it into the hot oil. At the same time, use your metal hoak or ladle to repeatedly spoon hot oil over the top of the pigeon. Make sure you pour hot oil over the head, neck, legs and tail. Try to angle the pigeon so the cavity opening is pointed down. Don’t pour oil into the cavity.
Repeat this process, turning the squab over if needed until your fried pigeon is a uniform amber color. How dark you want your fried pigeon is a personal preference. My experience eating this dish at restaurants is that they are generally a darker amber color. Repeat the process, one-by-one, for the rest of the squab.
The way to serve these fried pigeons is to cut off the head and place them at the head of the plate. We do the same thing for Cantonese Ginger Scallion Lobster. Cut off the claws and set them at the bottom of the plate opposite the heads. Next, use a chef’s knife or kitchen shears to cut the fried pigeon in half lengthwise and cut each half into a breast and leg quarter piece for a total of four pieces. Arrange the fried pigeon pieces on a large plate with freshly fried shrimp chips (you can quickly make these after you’ve finished frying the squab), lemon wedges and your five spice salt on the side.",en-US,"{'calories': '579 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '14 g', 'proteinContent': '16 g', 'fatContent': '40 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '4 g', 'cholesterolContent': '75 mg', 'sodiumContent': '765 mg', 'fiberContent': '1 g', 'sugarContent': '12 g', 'servingSize': '1 serving'}",5.0,,The Woks of Life,180,4 serving(s)

Budget about 1 day of thawing time for every 5 pounds. On the day before you plan to roast it, make the marinade by combining the garlic, salt, black pepper, olive oil, and butter in the food processor. Pulse until you have a very fine paste.
Put your carrots, celery, and onions on the bottom of your roasting pan. This will be the roasting ""rack"" that your turkey will sit on.
Remove the turkey from the package. Remove the neck and the giblets from the turkey cavity and give the bird a good rinse with cold water. Pat it thoroughly dry with paper towels, and lay it breast side up in the pan.
Spread half of your marinade all over the top side of the turkey, making sure you cover every surface and crevice, including the cavity. Flip the bird over so it's laying breast side down, and spread the other half of the marinade over this side of the turkey. Cover the roasting pan tightly with plastic and allow to marinate overnight. You can also spread some marinade over the neck and the giblets and add them to the roasting pan as well.
On the morning of the big day, take the turkey out of the fridge and let it sit on the counter (so you're not putting a cold turkey directly into the oven, which can prevent it from cooking evenly). About 3 hours before you're ready to eat, preheat the oven to 425 degrees F and arrange the oven rack so it's in the lower third of the oven. Take the plastic off your roasting pan and lift up the turkey to empty any liquid that might have accumulated in the cavity as it sat out on the counter. Make sure the wings are tucked in, and roast at 425 degrees for 1 hour, rotating the pan halfway through.
Remove the turkey from the oven and lower the temperature to 325 degrees. Using clean kitchen towels or a sturdy wooden spoon, flip the turkey breast-side up. Roast the turkey at the lower temperature for another hour (for a 12 pound turkey) to an hour and a half (for a 14 pound turkey), until the thigh registers 165 degrees and the juices run clear (i.e. not pink). Rotate the pan halfway through the second roasting process as well.
Remove the turkey from the oven, transfer to a carving board or serving plate, cover loosely with foil, and allow to rest for 20-30 minutes before carving.
Now, we know everyone has their own method for gravy, but here's ours: tip all the drippings from the roasting pan into a gravy separator. You want about 10 tablespoons of fat and 6 cups of the juices. If you don't have enough of either, you can add butter (if you need more fat) and chicken stock (if you don't have enough juice). In a large saucepan over medium heat, add the turkey fat and/or butter. Gradually stir in enough flour to make a roux, whisking constantly. Continue whisking until the roux turns a dark brown color, about 10 minutes. Slowly whisk in the turkey juices and/or broth. Season with salt and black pepper to taste. Simmer until thickened (when it coats the back of a spoon, it's perfect). If it's too thick, add more broth or water.

Heat the wok over high heat until it just starts to smoke. Coat the perimeter of the wok with two tablespoons of oil, and spread the chicken in one layer around the wok. Let it sear for 20 seconds. Turn the chicken and let the other side sear for another 20 seconds. Turn the heat off, and transfer the chicken back to your marinade bowl. The chicken should be about 60% done.

Next, add the Shaoxing wine and stir-fry for another minute. Then add the seared chicken slices and the hot chicken stock. It’s important to add hot or even boiling chicken stock to keep the wok up to temperature.

While the mixture is coming to a boil, add about a teaspoon of salt and a pinch of white pepper, along with the sugar, oyster sauce, and sesame oil. Stir until well-combined. Taste the sauce with a spoon and re-season to taste.

Grilled Tandoori Chicken with Indian-Style Rice,Bill,https://thewoksoflife.com/grilled-tandoori-chicken/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/grilled-tandoori-chicken-12.jpg,"['3 ounces plain Greek yogurt ((85g))', '2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice', '2 tablespoons garlic ((minced))', '2 tablespoons fresh ginger ((grated))', '2 teaspoons oil', '2½ teaspoons salt', '2 teaspoons ground Indian red pepper ((you can use cayenne or even Korean red chili powder in a pinch))', '1 tablespoon paprika', '2 teaspoons ground coriander seeds ((or coriander powder))', '1 tablespoon freshly ground cumin seed ((or powder))', '¾ teaspoon turmeric', '1 teaspoon ground cloves', '¼ teaspoon black pepper', '1½ teaspoons garam masala', '6 chicken leg quarters ((cut into drumsticks and thighs))', '1 cucumber ((sliced))', '1 medium red onion ((sliced))', 'Cilantro for garnish ((you can also use parsley))', '3 cups dry basmati rice ((585g))', '3 tablespoons oil ((or butter or ghee))', '3 teaspoons cumin seeds', '6 cloves', '1 cinnamon stick', '2 teaspoons salt ((or to taste))', '1 cup frozen peas']","Mix all of the marinade ingredients together in a bowl until well combined.
Use a sharp knife to cut slits into the chicken pieces; this will allow the marinade to really get into the chicken. 3 slits per drumstick and 4 to 5 per thigh should do the trick.
Usually, Tandoori Chicken calls for the skin to be removed, but I left it on because you want that crispy chicken skin (obviously). You can decide for yourself, but be aware that skin-on chicken is more prone to flare-ups when grilling. You’ll have to watch the chicken more closely while it’s on the grill and flip the pieces more often to avoid hot spots--all reasonable trade-offs for some extra flavor!
Place the chicken in a large dish. Spread the marinade all over the chicken and let marinate at least 12 hours, but not more than 2 days. We marinated our chicken for 16 hours, and even more marinating time wouldn’t have hurt!
Be sure to take the chicken out of the refrigerator 3 to 4 hours prior to grilling, so the chicken can come to room temperature--kind of like how you never want to grill a cold steak. This is an important step since there will be marinade on the chicken, and it will burn if the chicken is left too long on the grill because its internal temperature is too low.
This is a good time to make your Indian-style jeera rice. We’ve measured out enough rice here to take down all of the chicken, but feel free to make more or less. Wash the rice thoroughly and drain into your cooking vessel. Cover with water and allow to soak for 20 minutes.
While that’s happening, heat your oil/butter/ghee in a saucepan. When it’s melted, add the cumin seeds, cloves, and cinnamon stick. Let the spices infuse the oil for 2-3 minutes. After the rice has finished soaking, drain it thoroughly and add it to the spice mixture. Sauté the rice in the pan for about 2 minutes, and transfer to a rice cooker. Add the salt and water (according to your rice cooker directions), and press Start. If you’re not using a rice cooker, use our directions for perfect stovetop rice.
Now it's time to cook the chicken. Start your grill, and keep it covered until it reaches 500 degrees.
Shake off the excess marinade before placing the chicken on the hot grill. Cook with the grill covered, but stay close to watch for excess smoke, a sure indicator that your chicken is charring!
Turn the chicken as often as needed to prevent burning and keep the grill cover on so the chicken cooks through quickly. Our chicken took about 45 minutes, and we did have to turn and move the chicken pieces often.
The chicken is done when the juices run clear when poked or, better yet, use an instant-read thermometer to check the temperature near the bone. The optimal temperature for chicken is 165 degrees F.
For the rice, during the last 2-3 minutes of cooking time, add the frozen peas and stir thoroughly. Let the rice reheat. Serve the chicken with the rice, sliced fresh cucumbers, sliced red onion, and cilantro.",en-US,"{'calories': '279 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '6 g', 'proteinContent': '20 g', 'fatContent': '20 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '5 g', 'cholesterolContent': '107 mg', 'sodiumContent': '827 mg', 'fiberContent': '2 g', 'sugarContent': '2 g', 'servingSize': '1 serving'}",4.94,,The Woks of Life,1005,8 serving(s)
Chicken Egg Foo Young,Bill,https://thewoksoflife.com/egg-foo-young-chicken/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/egg-foo-yung-15.jpg,"['10 ounces boneless skinless chicken breast or thighs ((280g, cut into small cubes))', '1 tablespoon water', '1 teaspoon soy sauce', '2 teaspoons cornstarch ((divided))', '1 tablespoon vegetable or peanut oil ((plus 4-6 cups for frying, depending on the size of your wok))', '1 medium onion ((about 1 ½ cups diced))', '2 cups mung bean sprouts', '6 large eggs', '¼ teaspoon sesame oil', '1 scallion ((chopped))', 'Sesame seeds ((optional))', '1 tablespoon vegetable or peanut oil', '1 tablespoon flour', '1/2 teaspoon turmeric', '1/2 teaspoon paprika', '1/8 teaspoon garlic powder', '1/8 teaspoon onion powder', '3 cups low sodium chicken stock', '2 teaspoons soy sauce', '1 tablespoon oyster sauce', '1/2 teaspoon sesame oil', '1/4 teaspoon white pepper', '1/4 cup cornstarch', 'Salt ((to taste))', '1/4 cup chicken stock']","Mix the cubed chicken with 1 tablespoon of water until the water is absorbed by the chicken (for more on this technique, check out our Spicy Chicken Stir-fry recipe). Add 1 teaspoon soy sauce and 1 teaspoon cornstarch until well combined, and set aside.
Next, make the gravy. In a medium pot or saucepan, heat 1 tablespoon of oil over medium heat. Add 1 tablespoon of flour to make a roux, and cook for 15-20 seconds. Stir in the turmeric, paprika, garlic powder, and onion powder. Let fry for 15 seconds, and whisk in the chicken stock.
Bring the mixture to a simmer, and add the soy sauce, oyster sauce, sesame oil, and freshly ground white pepper to taste. The gravy should be slightly thickened from the roux. Mix the cornstarch with the ¼ cup of chicken stock or water to make a slurry (i.e. until the cornstarch is completely dissolved), and slowly stir in two-thirds of the mixture. Let cook for 30 seconds. Add more of the cornstarch slurry if necessary, until the gravy is thick enough to coat a spoon. Add salt or more soy sauce to your own taste. Be careful not to over-salt the gravy. Cover and set aside.
Next, sear the chicken. Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in your wok until it just starts to smoke, and add in the marinated chicken cubes. Sear for 1 minute on each side, and then stir-fry for another minute until just cooked through. Transfer back to the marinating bowl, and set aside to cool.
In a wok or deep pot, pre-heat your 6 cups of frying oil to 350F. Use a candy thermometer to check the temperature––too high a temperature will result in burned Egg Foo Young patties, and too low a temperature will give you greasy patties or will make your patties fall apart!
Meanwhile, place the cooled chicken, diced onion, and bean sprouts into a mixing bowl. Add the eggs, sesame oil, and second teaspoon of cornstarch. Do not add any salt or seasonings to this mixture, or your Egg Foo Young patties may not hold together when frying!
Use a large soup ladle or hoak (a Chinese ladle that’s often used together with a Chinese spatula) to fold the mixture together until just combined. The eggs should look like they are slightly beaten and only just mixed with the rest of the ingredients. If you over-mix the eggs, the whole mixture will become too watery and will not form a patty during frying.
Using your ladle, work quickly to slowly drop three separate scoops of the mixture into the wok for the first batch (you can also work in batches of 2 if your wok is smaller). Each scoop should be about 3/4 cup of the mixture. The correct technique is to tilt your ladle close to the oil, and pour the mixture starting from the edge where the oil meets the wok. Pour it slowly so the ladle barely touches the oil. Don’t let the egg cook while it’s in the ladle, or it will stick to the ladle, and you won’t have a smooth drop for the next Egg Foo Young patty.
Let the patties fry for about 40 seconds. You can also use your wok spatula to gently flip some hot oil on top of the uncooked patty to speed the cooking time. When each patty is solid and turning golden brown, use your wok spatula to turn them over in the same order that you dropped them into the oil.
After another 60 seconds, scoop each patty onto a mesh strainer, giving it a few gentle taps to remove excess oil. Place each patty on a wire rack over a sheet pan to drain until all of your patties are cooked.
Transfer the Egg Foo Young patties from the cooling rack to a serving plate (ideally these are served individually, rather than on a big family-style platter), pour the gravy over the top, add a sprinkling of scallions and toasted sesame seeds, and serve with additional gravy on the side.",en-US,"{'calories': '420 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '20 g', 'proteinContent': '28 g', 'fatContent': '26 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '11 g', 'cholesterolContent': '299 mg', 'sodiumContent': '455 mg', 'fiberContent': '2 g', 'sugarContent': '4 g', 'servingSize': '1 serving'}",4.99,,The Woks of Life,50,4 serving(s)
Roast Chicken on Wild Mushroom Sticky Rice “Risotto”,Sarah,https://thewoksoflife.com/roast-chicken-wild-mushroom-sticky-rice-risotto/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/roast-chicken-risotto-10.jpg,"['4 chicken leg quarters ((or 8 chicken thighs, trimmed of all fat))', 'salt and pepper', '1 lemon ((zested))', '1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves', 'Olive Oil', '1 onion ((finely chopped))', '1 pound wild mushrooms ((450g; shiitake, porcini, crimini, oyster, chanterelle, etc.))', '½ cup dry white wine', '6 cups cooked sticky rice', '2 scallions ((chopped))', '4 cups chicken stock ((about 1 liter))', '½ cup parmesan cheese', '1/4 cup fresh parsley ((chopped))']","Take your chicken leg quarters and pat them dry with a paper towel. Put them in a large bowl. Season generously with salt and pepper, and add the lemon zest and thyme to the bowl. Rub the seasoning into the chicken thoroughly and set aside.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees. In a large skillet over medium heat, add a couple tablespoons olive oil. Add the onion and cook until just starting to caramelize. Add the mushrooms and cook until caramelized. Season with salt and pepper. Deglaze the pan with the wine and cook for another couple minutes.
Turn off the heat. Add all the mushrooms back into the pan and stir in the rice, scallions, chicken stock, and parmesan cheese. Check for seasoning and transfer the mushroom and rice mixture to a baking dish. Top with the chicken and brush it with olive oil.
Bake for about 50-60 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through, and the rice is bubbly. Turn on the broiler for a couple minutes if the chicken still needs a bit of color on top.
