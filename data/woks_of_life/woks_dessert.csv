Jianshui Zong (Alkaline Rice Dumplings - 碱水粽),Judy,https://thewoksoflife.com/alkaline-rice-dumplings-zongzi/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/alkaline-zongzi-24-1.jpg,"['9 ounces dried adzuki beans ((255g, 1 ¼ cups))', '3 ¾ cups water ((890 ml))', '½ teaspoon baking soda', '1/2 cup sugar ((100g, or to taste))', '¼ cup vegetable oil ((60 ml))', '1 pound sweet rice ((also called sticky rice, 450g or about 2 ¼ cups))', '1 ½ tablespoons lye water', '½ tablespoon vegetable oil', '30-40 dried bamboo leaves', '1 ½ teaspoons lye water', 'Kitchen string']","The Day Before: Make the Red Bean Paste:
Soak the red beans in water for 2 to 3 hours, then rinse off and drain.
Add the soaked red beans, 3 ¾ cups water, and baking soda to a medium pot. Cover and bring to a boil, then immediately reduce the heat to a simmer until the beans are softened and opened-up (about 30 minutes). Stir periodically to avoid burning.
If you see a lot of liquid remaining even after the beans are softened and have opened up, turn up the heat, remove the lid, and let the liquid cook off. While you’re doing this, watch the beans closely and stir occasionally to avoid burning. Remove from the heat and let the beans cool for a bit before pureeing the cooked beans in a food processor. You can also use an immersion blender, but a food processor will result in a more even puree.
Put the red bean puree in a thick-bottomed pan set over medium-high heat, and cook off the liquid, stirring constantly. This process will take about 25 to 30 minutes. Add the sugar (about 1/2 cup or to taste) early in the cooking process so it has a chance to fully dissolve.
Towards the end of the cooking time, add the ¼ cup of vegetable oil in two batches. The oil will prevent the puree from sticking to the pan too much. The paste is done once it “stays” in place rather than oozing across the pan. Transfer the paste to a dish, and let it cool before storing it in the refrigerator, covered.
The Night Before: Soak the Rice and Bamboo Leaves:
Rinse the sweet rice a couple of times until the water runs clear rather than cloudy. Next, transfer the rice to a large bowl with enough water so that the water line is ½-inch above the rice. Stir in 1½ tablespoons of lye water and ½ tablespoon vegetable oil. Once the lye water hits the fresh water, both the rice and water will turn a light yellow color––that’s normal. Soak the rice, covered, in the refrigerator overnight.
In a large basin (or your kitchen sink), soak the bamboo leaves overnight. Weigh the leaves down with something heavy to make sure all of the leaves are submerged.
The Next Day: Making and Cooking the Zongzi:
Clean each bamboo leaf, front and back, with a clean kitchen towel, shaking off any excess water and trimming off about a half inch of the bamboo leaf at the base (this part is too tough and rigid to handle). Set aside.
Take the soaked rice out of the refrigerator, and drain off all of the liquid. Set it aside.
Take out the red bean paste, and divide it into 15 equal-sized balls.
Now you’re ready to assemble the zongzi! Take two bamboo leaves and follow the steps shown in the photos, tying them off with kitchen string. Each rice dumpling takes about 2 tablespoons of soaked rice and one portion of red bean paste. Just remember not to tie the string too snugly, as the rice will need room to expand during the cooking process. After unwrapping a zongzi, it shouldn’t look like it has been wearing a pair of pants that’s two sizes too small. :)
In a large pot, arrange the zongzi neatly, and fill the pot with water--about 1-inch above the top of the zongzi. Add 1 ½ teaspoon of lye water to the pot, and place a heat-proof bowl or plate on top of everything to weigh down the zongzi. Bring the water to a boil, and then turn the heat to medium to slow cook the zongzi for 2½ hours. Check the water levels periodically, replenishing the pot with boiling water when the waterline falls below the top of zongzi.
After 2 ½ hours, turn off the heat, and take out the zongzi to let them cool. Serve the zongzi at room temperature with sugar or the syrup of your choice!",en-US,"{'calories': '229 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '42 g', 'proteinContent': '5 g', 'fatContent': '4 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '3 g', 'sodiumContent': '43 mg', 'fiberContent': '3 g', 'sugarContent': '7 g', 'servingSize': '1 serving'}",5.0,,The Woks of Life,360,15 serving(s)
Lotus Mooncakes with Salted Egg Yolks,Judy,https://thewoksoflife.com/lotus-mooncakes-egg-yolks/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/lotus-mooncakes-32.jpg,"['8 ounces granulated sugar ((1 cup plus 2 tablespoons, 225g))', '½ cup water ((120 ml))', 'Juice of ½ a lemon', '12 ounces dried lotus seeds ((340g, pre-halved is ideal if you can find it; we used whole))', '4 cups water ((950 ml))', ""1⅔ cups powdered sugar ((210g, aka icing sugar or confectioner's sugar))"", '1¼ cups peanut oil or corn oil ((300 ml))', '12 salted duck egg yolks', '140 ml sugar syrup (that you made or bought)', '⅓ cup peanut oil or corn oil ((80 ml))', '1 teaspoon lye water ((available at your Chinese grocery store))', '1 ⅔ cups flour ((about 250g, plus more for dusting))', '1 egg yolk', '3 tablespoons water']","Making the Syrup: Heat the sugar and water in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir to dissolve the sugar. Once it’s boiled, add the lemon juice, stir, and immediately turn the heat down to low. Keep the lid off, and let the syrup simmer for about 60 to 70 minutes until the sugary liquid turns a light amber color. Do not stir during this time frame! By now, the liquid might look too watery, but it will thicken once it’s cooled. Try not to overcook it, because it will become thick like caramel (it should be the consistency of honey). Just in case you do overcook the syrup, and it’s too thick, add a few drops of hot water to thin it out. Keep adding the hot water until you get the right consistency. Now pour the sugary liquid into a heatproof container, and let it cool completely before storing it in the refrigerator.
Making the Lotus Paste: Using a butter knife, gently split the lotus seeds in half through the top opening. Remove and discard the green center. Wash and soak them overnight. The next day, wash and drain the lotus seeds. In a pot, add the lotus seeds and 4 cups of water (the water level should be above the lotus seeds). Bring the mixture to a boil over high heat. Once the water reaches a boil, turn the heat to low, and let the seeds simmer for 30 minutes. It’s done once the lotus seeds are softened but have maintained their shape. Turn off the heat, let cool, and then drain the liquid. In a food processor, puree the cooked lotus seeds (it’s best to do this in two batches). Transfer the lotus puree to a non-stick pan (or a cast-iron pan, or a pan with a thick bottom to avoid sticking and burning). Turn the heat to medium low, and stir/flip/turn the puree using a rubber spatula non-stop for about 30 minutes (nice to have the TV or an audiobook on as you're doing this). In between, add in the powdered sugar and oil in 3 alternating batches. With each batch, make sure the sugar and oil is well incorporated before adding more. The lotus filling is done once the lotus paste is slightly firmer/can hold its shape. Let it cool completely before storing in the refrigerator in an airtight container. You can make this one day ahead of time, and I found that it’s easier to work with when the filling has been chilled.
Making the salted duck egg yolks: There are a couple of ways to go about preparing the salted duck egg yolk: The ones I bought are already cooked, so they were ready to use, and you can buy the same. But I did find them to be slightly drier than I would normally like. You can also buy whole cooked salted duck eggs, and extract the whole yolk. You can buy raw salted duck eggs, crack the eggs open, and take out the yolks. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Dip each yolk in baijiu (白酒, a clear Chinese liquor made from grain), just briefly to coat it, then put the egg yolks on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake for 8 minutes, let them cool completely, and they are ready to use. You can also prepare this ahead of time...just make sure to store them in an airtight container and in the fridge.
Making the dough: First mix the sugar syrup, oil, and lye water together. Then add the mixture to the flour, and use a rubber spatula to fold and combine everything into a soft dough. Do not overwork the dough--this step should only take about a minute or two. Cover the dough in an airtight container or wrap in plastic wrap. Let it rest in the refrigerator for an hour. Chilled dough is much easier to work with. (Side note: you may also leave the dough in the refrigerator overnight if you'd like to make it ahead of time.)
Assembling the mooncakes: While the dough is resting, let’s start assembling the filling. My mooncake mold was marked 100 grams, which means each mooncake should weigh about 100 grams after assembly. This recipe makes 18 mooncakes total: 12 mooncakes with salted duck egg yolks and 6 mooncakes without. Separately weigh out twelve 58-gram scoops of lotus filling and six 70-gram scoops of lotus filling. Shape each portion of filling into balls. Next, take one of the 58 gram lotus balls, make a deep well in the middle, and insert one salted duck egg yolk into the middle. Then close the top and re-shape it into a ball. Repeat for the remaining 11 pieces. It’s good to separate the “with” and the “without.” It’s also a good idea to put them back into the refrigerator, covered, until you are ready to assemble the rest of the mooncakes. Once the dough has finished resting, it’s time to prepare the mooncake mold. My mooncake mold came with four pattern plates––one plate should be attached to the mold itself. Wrap another one with clear plastic, because we will use it to press the mooncake from the bottom;, Now dust the inside of the mold with plenty of flour and shake off the excess. You’ll need to repeat this process before pressing every mooncake to avoid sticking. Divide and weigh the dough into eighteen 25-gram pieces, plus 1 smaller dough ball for scraps/mending, which I will get to. Shape each piece into a ball. Lightly dust the dough balls with flour. Take one dough ball and roll it out on a lightly floured surface into a 4-inch round. Put one piece of filling in the center. Carefully lift it up and turn it upside down, and gently press out the air bubbles around the lotus ball, without breaking the dough. Now turn the opening facing up, and slowly press the dough together to close the opening, keeping the distribution of the dough as even as possible. The dough feels like Play-doh, so it’s easy to break, but it’s also easy to squish back together. These instructions might sound confusing, but follow along with the pictures and keep in mind that the chief goal here is to close the dough around the filling without capturing air inside. Now lightly dust the assembled ball with additional flour. Place it inside the mooncake mold with the mold opening facing up. Now press in the bottom piece (with the clear plastic-wrapped plate that you prepared). With some pressure, gently press it inward. Quickly sit the mold down, and press the mooncake out with the top pressure bar. The bottom piece will come out no problem, but use your other hand to VERY GENTLY guide the mooncake out of the mold. When and if a small piece of dough gets stuck and does not come out, get a small piece of the “scrap”/“mending” dough to patch up the area. Then clean the mold and dust it well with flour again. Then gently flatten all sides of the mooncake to make it smaller, so it can go back in the mooncake mold for re-shaping. Use slightly more flour for dusting if this becomes a persistent issue. Place the mooncakes on a baking sheet as you make them.
Baking the mooncakes: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees when you are almost finished assembling the mooncakes. Once the oven is preheated, gently mist the mooncakes with a food-grade spray bottle (if you have one) filled with water. But since I didn’t have one, I just used my fingers, and it worked fine! Dip your fingers into a bowl of water, and fling the water on your fingers onto the mooncakes a couple of times. This prevents the dough from cracking. Then, immediately put the mooncakes in the oven and bake for 5 minutes. (Remember to set the timer!) Now prepare the egg wash by whisking the egg yolk and water together. After the mooncakes have been baking for 5 minutes, take them out of the oven and immediately lower the oven temperature to 300 degrees. Now lightly brush each mooncake with egg wash, and put them back in the oven. Bake them for another 15 minutes and remember to set the timer. When the time has elapsed, take them out and let them cool completely.
When the mooncakes first come out of the oven, the dough looks dry like bread, and not oily like what you are used to when opening packaged mooncakes. This is normal. Store the cooled mooncakes in an airtight container for a day or two, and the outside will get that nice shiny sheen that you recognize and love.
After this last step, any uneaten mooncakes can be kept in the refrigerator for a week or two.",en-US,"{'calories': '308 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '51 g', 'proteinContent': '6 g', 'fatContent': '9 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '2 g', 'cholesterolContent': '141 mg', 'sodiumContent': '16 mg', 'fiberContent': '1 g', 'sugarContent': '29 g', 'servingSize': '1 serving'}",4.85,,The Woks of Life,840,18 serving(s)

Drain the soaked beans and transfer the red beans and mung beans to two separate pots. Add 3 cups of fresh water to each.
Bring both pots to a boil. For the red adzuki bean mixture, reduce the heat and simmer for 1 hour. It depends a little bit on the soaking time and the age of the beans. For the green mung bean soup, simmer for 20-30 minutes, until the beans are tender and breaking open.
When the beans look soft and broken down, use an immersion blender to blend just ½ cup of each bean soup into a puree. Then add the puree back to the pots. Cool completely before using. I made mine one day ahead of time and let it chill overnight. If you do this, you may need to loosen the red bean mixture with some water the next day, as the adzuki beans can be quite starchy.
Prepare Ice for Shaving
Freeze ice in molds that came with your ice shaving machine.
Prepare Toppings
Cook the tapioca pearls in separate small pots per package instructions. For the dried white tapioca pearls, use these instructions. The white tapioca pearls can be slightly tricky to cook, but the black tapioca pearls (the ones in the packages that say, “Ready in 5 Minutes”) cook quickly, so feel free to only use those if you prefer.
Prepare the glutinous rice balls per our recipe. We had some set aside in the freezer, so all we had to do was boil them and cool them under running water.
Next, prepare the milk mixture by mixing the 3 milks together. You can opt to use all coconut milk, or all dairy milk if you prefer one over the other. As for the condensed milk, this is where most of the sweetness comes from, and the thicker the milk mixture, the better it’ll be over the ice.
Assemble the Shaved Ice
Shave the ice and heap it into a big tower in a shallow bowl. You may need to shave the ice into a smaller bowl than what you’ll serve it in. If you need to move ice around, just be sure to move quickly!
Using a spoon, drip the red bean and mung bean mixtures down the sides of the ice tower in alternating columns. Then, place the boba, tapioca, and glutinous rice balls around the base of the ice tower. Finally, pour the milk mixture over the top, letting it soak into the ice and flow down the sides.
One serving of this shaved ice takes about 1 cup of shaved ice, as much of the bean mixtures and toppings as you want, and ½-⅔ cup milk. Go by your own preferences and build them how you like!",en-US,{},5.0,,The Woks of Life,810,4 serving(s)

To make dough:
In a large mixing bowl, combine the powdered sugar, milk, and oil. Sift in 50g glutinous (sweet) rice flour, 35g rice flour, and 35g wheat starch. Stir and mix well until there are no lumps.
Pour the dough mixture into a heat-proof bowl that will fit in your steamer. Cover it with clear plastic wrap, and let it rest on the counter for 30 minutes.
Prepare a steamer by filling it with enough water to steam on high heat for 25 minutes. Place the rested dough (still in the heatproof bowl) into your steamer while the water in the steamer is still cold. Keep the plastic wrap on the dough as it steams to protect it from condensation. Do keep the plastic wrap away from the hot sides of the steamer.
Place the steamer over high heat, cover, and steam for 25 minutes. The dough is cooked once it has turned from fully opaque to fully translucent. A little oil floating to the top is normal. If the dough is not completely cooked through, just put the plastic wrap back on and steam for another 5 minutes over high heat.
Once the dough is done cooking, carefully stir it to gradually cool it down. Once cool enough to handle, put on your food prep gloves, and knead the dough for a few minutes to ensure the oil is well absorbed and the dough is smooth. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap, and chill in the refrigerator for 1-2 hours.
Cook the remaining 25g glutinous (sweet) rice flour in a clean, dry pan over medium low heat for 6-7 minutes, until it turns very lightly brown. Stir often to avoid burning, and set aside to cool completely. You’ll use this flour for dusting.
To assemble:
You should have about 400g of dough. The ideal dough to filling ratio is about 1:1. For a 50g mooncake mold, you’ll need 25g dough and 25g filling. Put on your food prep gloves, and weigh/divide the filling into portions that correspond to the size of your mooncake mold. Roll each portion of filling into a ball. Repeat the same step with the dough after chilling. A plastic dough cutter works well (it doesn’t stick to the dough), or you can just rip the dough apart with your gloved hands. The dough should be pliable and very easy to work with.
Lay a piece of clear plastic wrap on your work surface to prevent sticking. Take each dough ball, and press it into a round disc with your palm. For a 50g mooncake, the circle should be no bigger than 3 inches (7.5 cm) in diameter. For a 100g mooncake, the skin should be no bigger than 4 inches (10 cm) in diameter. If you’d like to use a rolling pin, the dough must be between two layers of plastic wrap to avoid sticking.
Place a ball of filling in the center of the dough circle, and carefully lift the whole thing up and turn it upside down. Gently press out the air bubbles around the filling ball.
Turn the opening face up, and slowly press the dough together to close the opening, keeping the dough as even as possible all around.
Dust the inside of the mooncake mold VERY well by brushing all the nooks and crannies with the cooked glutinous rice flour (AKA sweet rice flour). Mooncake molds have intricate designs where dough can get stuck, so it pays to make sure it’s well-floured. Shake off any excess flour, and carefully place the ball inside the mold. Do not force it in. If necessary, re-shape the mooncake ball so it can easily fit into the mold.
Flip the mooncake mold so the open side is facing down on the plastic wrap work surface. With slight pressure, gently press down the spring bar on the mold until you feel resistance. Lift the mold, gently press the spring bar (to push the mooncake out of the mold), and carefully guide (and catch) the mooncake out of the mold with your other hand. Continue this process until all the mooncakes are assembled.",en-US,"{'calories': '264 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '52 g', 'proteinContent': '4 g', 'fatContent': '4 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '3 g', 'cholesterolContent': '3 mg', 'sodiumContent': '12 mg', 'fiberContent': '2 g', 'sugarContent': '32 g', 'servingSize': '1 serving'}",5.0,,The Woks of Life,240,8 serving(s)

After the dough’s been chilled, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a couple baking sheets with parchment paper. Cut shapes out of the dough, and continue re-rolling/cutting until all the dough has been used up.
Bake 8-10 minutes, rotating the baking sheets halfway through. The cookies should have very light coloring. Don’t over-bake, or they’ll be way too crunchy! Cool completely.

Shepherd’s Purse Tofu Soup,Bill,https://thewoksoflife.com/shepherds-purse-tofu-soup/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/shepherds-purse-tofu-soup-3.jpg,"['8 ounces frozen Shepherd’s purse', '½ block silken tofu', '4 cups homemade chicken stock', '1 1/2 teaspoons salt ((or to taste))', '1 teaspoon sesame oil', '¼ teaspoon ground white pepper', '1/4 cup cornstarch', '3 egg whites']","Prepare the shepherd’s purse by thawing it out in a colander. When it’s completely thawed, use your hands to gently squeeze the water from it. Chop the leaves into small pieces. Set aside.
Prepare, the silken tofu by cutting it into ½-inch cubes. Set aside. It can be tricky to keep them in a cube shape since the silken tofu is delicate, so don’t worry if they aren’t perfect.
Heat the chicken stock in a medium pot or wok. Add the salt, sesame oil, and ground white pepper. Let everything come to a slow simmer.
Stir up your cornstarch and water mixture since the cornstarch settles at the bottom of the bowl when left standing. Turn the heat down, and use your metal hoak or soup ladle to stir the soup in a circular motion so the soup is moving and swirling. Slowly drizzle all of the cornstarch slurry into the soup while stirring. The trick to thickening the soup with cornstarch is to turn the heat down slightly and keep the soup moving so the cornstarch does not form clumps.
As you continue stirring, turn the heat back up to get the soup to a very low simmer. Check the soup for seasoning and add more salt if needed. Don’t worry if the soup tastes a little saltier than you’d like at this stage, because the Shepherd’s purse and the silken tofu are both unseasoned.
Simmer the soup for a minute, and add the chopped shepherd’s purse. Stir it gently until the leaves are well distributed.
Next, gently add the silken tofu cubes into the soup, and stir, taking care not to break up the tofu. You want to ensure that the tofu and shepherd’s purse are uniformly distributed in the soup and that both are heated evenly. The soup should start to simmer in about 2 to 4 minutes. At this point, you can add a bit more cornstarch slurry if you like a thicker soup, but keep in mind that the soup will thicken more as it cools.
Beat the egg whites briskly for about 10 seconds until the white is broken up and just starts to bubble.
Next, take your ladle or hoak and move it in a wide, steady swirling motion around the perimeter of the pot or wok until the soup is moving. Slowly drizzle the egg white into the soup.
At this point, adjust the heat so the soup is simmering. Taste the soup again, and season to taste with salt, white pepper, and sesame oil if needed. (Sesame oil and especially white pepper enhances the taste of the Shepherd’s purse, so you can add more or simply put these condiments on the table so they can be added as needed.)

Distribute the batter evenly amongst the three pans; I like to use a ladle for the batter and fill each pan ladle by ladle to ensure even distribution without fussing with a scale.
Bake the cakes for 35-40 minutes. Be careful not to over-bake them! Because of the high amounts of sugar and add-ins, the cake can quickly crisp too much on the edges. Remove the pans from the oven and cool for 15-20 minutes before turning out onto wire racks to cool completely.
When your cakes are cooled, make your cream cheese frosting. In the bowl of an electric mixer, combine the butter, cream cheese, and vanilla. Cream on low to medium speed. With the mixer on low, gradually add the confectioner’s sugar, scraping down the bowl as needed. If it looks too thick, add a little splash of milk. If it's too loose, add more confectioner's sugar.

Sesame Balls,Bill,https://thewoksoflife.com/sesame-balls/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/sesame-balls-24.jpg,"['1 1/2 cups glutinous rice flour ((divided))', '1/3 cup granulated sugar', '1/4 cup boiling water', '1/4 cup room temperature water ((plus 1 tablespoon))', '7 ounces lotus paste or red bean paste', '1/4 cup sesame seeds ((raw or toasted are both fine))', '4 cups peanut or vegetable oil ((for frying))']","Choose your filling—You can buy ready-made filling pastes at the Asian or Chinese grocery store, or use our lotus paste or red bean paste recipes. We used lotus paste.
Make sesame ball dough. Place 1/2 cup (60g) glutinous rice flour and sugar in a bowl. Pour ¼ cup (60g) of boiling water into the flour and sugar. Mix with a rubber spatula until smooth. Let sit for 5 minutes. Add ¼ cup + 1 tablespoon (70g) room temperature water and the rest of the glutinous flour (1 cup, 120g). Mix with a spatula until it forms a dough, and all the flour has been incorporated. Cover with an overturned plate or put it in a reusable silicone bag. Set aside to rest for 30 minutes.
Prepare your sesame seeds by pouring them in a fine-meshed strainer and rinsing them until they're completely soaked. Let the excess water drain and place the sesame seeds on a plate. Spread them out evenly with enough space for rolling the sesame balls. You can use a paper towel if the sesame seeds are very wet. They should be moist, but not dripping wet.
Your filling should be half the weight of your dough ball. Use your kitchen scale to measure out 8 pieces of lotus or red bean paste that weigh 24g each. Roll them into balls and set aside.
Weigh the dough ball on a digital kitchen scale – it should weigh about 370 to 380 grams. Whatever your weight is, divide it by 8 to get the weight for each dough ball (in our case, we got 47g). Using the kitchen scale, separate the dough into 8 equal pieces, and roll them into balls. Set them aside on a plate, and cover them so they don’t dry out.
To assemble, flatten the dough ball until it is 3 inches in diameter – the middle should be slightly thicker. Place 1 ball of filling in the center of the dough, wrapping the dough around the ball. Pinch the dough together so it covers all the filling, making the thickness of the dough as even as possible. You can pinch excess dough from the point where the sesame ball is sealed to fill empty spots or reinforce areas that look thin.
After the filling is completely covered, gently press it all together to form a ball, rolling it between the palms of your hands until the seams disappear, and you form a uniform round ball.
Roll the ball in the moistened sesame seeds until the entire ball is thoroughly covered. Roll the ball again in your hands to press the sesame seeds into the dough and place on parchment paper until they are ready to deep-fry.
Heat 4 cups of peanut or canola oil in a medium deep pot to a stable 320°F/160°C. (Use a thermometer for accuracy, as achieving the right oil temperature is extremely important.) The oil should fill the pot about halfway.
Add 4 sesame balls into the oil, and immediately use a slotted spoon to gently move them in a circular motion so they do not stick to the pot. This is a necessary step throughout the entire process to ensure even frying. Don’t leave them unattended. Adding the sesame balls will lower the oil temperature down below 300°F/150°C, but shouldn’t take it below 290°F/143°C. Adjust the heat slightly higher or lower to maintain the oil temperature at 300°F/150°C.
After 10 minutes, your sesame balls will begin to float to the top of the oil. Now, your technique changes to keep them rolling in the oil so all sides get the same frying time. You can also occasionally press all four sesame balls down using a slotted spoon or small spider to keep them submerged in the oil. Do this for 2-3 minutes.
At this stage, increase the heat to bring the oil temperature gradually up to 350°F. Fry them for another 5 minutes, for a total of 17-18 minutes, or until they turn a light golden brown. This last stage of frying at a higher temperature browns them. The sesame balls will expand and grow slightly at this higher oil temperature. The outer crust is now strong enough such that they should not burst, as long as you don’t have any weak or thin spots in the dough.
Transfer the finished sesame balls to a strainer, cooling rack or plate lined with paper towels for the oil to drain. Repeat with the second batch. Cool for 10 minutes and serve.",en-US,"{'calories': '283 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '49 g', 'proteinContent': '4 g', 'fatContent': '8 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '1 g', 'sodiumContent': '1 mg', 'fiberContent': '2 g', 'sugarContent': '20 g', 'servingSize': '1 serving'}",4.92,,The Woks of Life,120,8 serving(s)

Heat another 2 tablespoons oil in your wok until it just starts to smoke. Add the roast pork and stir-fry for about 20 seconds. Add the onion, garlic, and pepper, and stir-fry for another minute. The heat should still be high, and you should be stirring constantly. You want enough sizzle to produce that ""wok hay"" (literally translated to: 'breath of the wok') flavor.
Add the ham and stir-fry for another 30 seconds. Add the soaked noodles and give everything a good stir. Toss in the eggs and shrimp and stir-fry until the noodles are heated through--about 3-5 minutes.
Add the shaoxing wine, sugar, oyster sauce, soy sauce, and sesame oil. Mix well. If your noodles begin to stick, the wok is probably not hot enough. Just use your metal wok spatula and make sure to scrape anything off the bottom of the wok so it doesn't burn!

Add 2 cups of water and the ginger to a medium-sized pot, bring it a boil, then let it simmer for 10 minutes over low to medium heat with the lid covered. Turn off the heat, and stir in the brown sugar and allspice until the sugar is dissolved completely. Remove the ginger slices. Now add 1 1/2 cups of cold water to cool down the mixture so its warm, not hot.
In a large mixing bowl, mix the two kinds of flours together and then slowly add in the sugar water mixture. Stir thoroughly until the batter is smooth (without any lumps). Now stir in the vanilla extract, molasses, orange zest, and 2 teaspoons of vegetable oil until thoroughly combined. The resulting batter should have a consistency similar to condensed milk. If the batter is too thick, add a bit more water a couple tablespoons at a time until the desired consistency is reached.
Pour the batter evenly into two foil pans. Gently tap the pans against your countertop to get rid of air bubbles. Top each pan with three decorative dates in the center, if using. Put both pans in a double-decker bamboo steamer and steam for about 1 hour on high heat (the water should be boiling, but should NOT be bubbling high enough to touch the foil pans). You might need to add water into the steamer midway to avoid having the water dry up and burn your bamboo steamers.
After 1 hour, poke a toothpick into the rice cake. It’s done if the toothpick comes out clean--just like a regular cake! Regarding steaming techniques, for this recipe and in general, it doesn’t matter what type of vessel you use. The core goal here is to use steam to cook the food, which means it's important that the steam doesn't escape.
For example, if you use bamboo steamer, you will also need a pot that fits the bamboo steamer perfectly so there is no visible steam escaping. If you don’t have a pot that fits the bamboo steamer, you will need to put the bamboo steamer inside a much larger pot with a lid and set the bamboo steamer on a rack above the water.

Close the lid and set your Instant Pot on the Bean/Chili setting for 25 minutes. Once the cooking time has elapsed, leave it untouched for another 10 minutes. Remember, before you open the lid, carefully release the vent to let out the steam, and protect your hand with an oven mitt.
Carefully transfer the cooked beans and liquid to a food processor to puree. If you have a smaller food processor, puree it in multiple batches as needed.
In a thick-bottomed pan or nonstick pan, heat ¼ cup oil over medium heat. Add the adzuki bean puree and the sugar. Cook down until you have a thick paste. This process takes about 30-40 minutes, and you should only use medium/medium low heat. Remember to stir from the bottom every couple of minutes to prevent sticking and/or burning.
During the cooking process, you can adjust the sugar to taste, and add the remaining oil in three portions every 10 minutes, ensuring the oil is well absorbed before adding more. The filling is done once it can hold its shape and a rubber spatula comes out clean.

Add the butter and rub it in with your fingertips or a pastry cutter until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. You can also do this step using a food processor.
Add the sugar, currants, and spices, and stir with a wooden spoon to mix. Add the egg and enough milk to form a soft but not sticky dough. Mary Berry needed a little more than 2 tablespoons. I needed closer to 4 tablespoons. The dough should resemble pie crust dough. You can knead it to get it to come together, but no more than a few times. You don’t want your Welsh cakes to turn out tough!
On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough to a ¼-inch thickness. Cut into rounds with the pastry cutter until all of the dough has been used (just ball up any excess and re-roll in order to cut out as many as you can). I used a scalloped 2-inch round and a similar-sized heart.
Heat a griddle or heavy frying pan over medium heat, and melt a little butter in it. A thin pat is sufficient for each batch--that’s 7 welsh cakes that fit into my cast-iron skillet.
Cook the Welsh cakes over medium heat for 3-4 minutes on each side until cooked through and golden brown. Be careful on the first flip, as they are still a little fragile--similar to American pancakes--at this point. During the cooking process, you may have to turn the heat up or down. I modulated between medium-high and medium-low.
Let cool on a wire rack and continue to cook the cakes in batches. They’re best when fresh, and even a little warm.

Transfer the blended mixture back to the pot. If you like a soupier consistency, feel free to add additional water at this stage until you reach your desired consistency. Add the sugar and orange zest. Stir over medium to medium-high heat to dissolve the sugar. The mixture should bubble very gently.

Transfer to a medium pot and soak in 9 cups of water for at least two hours prior to cooking. Mix the glutinous (sweet) rice flour with ½ cup of cold water until completely dissolved, and set aside.
When two hours have passed, add the sugar to the pot, and bring to a boil with the lid on. Once boiled, turn the heat down and simmer for 30-35 minutes until the mung beans are soft, with the majority still maintaining their shape. During this time, check the beans periodically, because fresher beans cook much faster than older beans. Depending on what you have, you may not need the full 30 minutes to cook the mung beans to the right consistency. Be sure not to overcook them.
Now turn up the heat, bring the mixture to a boil, and add the glutinous rice flour mixture. (Make sure to give it a stir to recombine before adding.) Stir the mixture quickly, and turn off the heat. Drain and scoop out a cup of cooked beans, and set aside to cool.
Let the mung bean soup cool completely before adding it to a blender, and pulse it a couple of times to break down the beans without turning it into a puree. Now we’re ready to assemble the popsicles!
First, add a spoonful of the cooked beans you set aside earlier to the bottom of each mold (the tip of the popsicle), then pour in the blended mung bean soup, leaving ⅛-inch between the surface of the liquid and the top of the mold, because the mixture will expand after freezing. Once all the molds are filled, lightly pound the mold 10 times against the table to get rid of air bubbles. Cover the molds with your lid, insert the popsicle sticks, and freeze for about 6 hours, or until completely frozen.

Break up the graham crackers into smaller pieces and put them in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse until they’ve turned into crumbs. Add the melted butter and process again until the mixture resembles wet sand. Press evenly into the bottom of the springform pan, packing the graham cracker crumbs down as tightly as you can.

Turn the mixer on to the lowest setting to bring the dough together. Knead on low speed for 15 minutes. If needed, turn off the mixer to bring the dough together with a rubber spatula.
The dough should not stick to the sides of the mixer, but it may look a little bit sticky (sticking to the bottom of the mixer is ok). If you’re in a humid climate, and the dough is sticking to the sides of the mixing bowl, add more flour 1 tablespoon at a time until it comes together. Alternatively, you can stir all the dough ingredients together with a wooden spoon in a large mixing bowl, and then knead by hand for 20 minutes.
Shape the dough into a ball, and cover the bowl with an overturned plate or damp towel. Place in a warm spot to proof for 75-90 minutes, or until the dough doubles in size. (A good proofing environment is a closed microwave, with a mug of hot boiled water next to the bowl.)
While that's happening, mix the filling. In a medium bowl, combine the coconut, milk powder, sugar, salt, melted butter, egg yolks, and milk. Set aside.
After the first proof, knead for another 5 minutes to punch the air out of it. Then dump the dough on a lightly floured surface, shape it into a ball, and cut it in half. Cut each half of dough into 6 pieces, so you get 12 equal pieces of dough.
To shape the buns, knead and roll piece of dough into an even ball, and flatten. Roll into a 5x10 inch rectangle. Spread a layer of filling onto the rectangle, pressing the filling into the dough and leaving about a half inch of margin all around.
Roll the dough lengthwise into a cigar. Cut the cigar in half lengthwise, leaving it attached at the top end, so it looks like a long pair of pants.

Once cooled, use your hands to break up the nuts into rough pieces. Break up the crackers into smaller pieces, but be careful not to crush them too fine.
Melt the butter in a large non-stick skillet over medium low heat. While we’re not a huge fan of non-stick cookware, it makes this recipe (and clean-up) much easier.
Add the marshmallows, and stir until melted (about 3 to 4 minutes).Once the marshmallows and butter are melted together, turn down the heat to low and immediately stir in the vanilla extract, toasted nuts, pistachios (or pumpkin seeds) and cranberries.
Add the crackers, breaking any larger pieces as you stir them. Use a folding motion to mix and stir the entire mixture until everything is uniformly coated. Do not compress the mixture together when stirring.
There are a couple options for shaping and cutting your holiday marshmallow treats: A. Lightly grease a non-stick square pan or spray it with non-stick baking spray and pour in the mixture. Use wax or parchment paper to shape the mixture into a rectangle.B. Roll out a few crackers on a cutting board or counter to create crumbs (the crumbs will function as a “nonstick” surface to work on). You can also spray the counter-top or place a large piece of wax or parchment paper as your work surface. Pour mixture onto the surface and shape it into a rectangle.

Tang Yuan (Sweet Rice Balls with Black Sesame Filling),Judy,https://thewoksoflife.com/tang-yuan-recipe/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/tang-yuan-4.jpg,"['2 oz. roasted black sesame seeds ((57g))', '3 oz. caster sugar ((85g, about 1/3 cup))', '6 tablespoons softened butter ((not melted!))', '1 cup sweet rice flour ((also known as glutinous rice flour, plus more for dusting))', '1/2 cup warm water']","In a food processor or blender, finely grind the sesame seeds. Add the caster sugar and use a spatula to mix together in the food processor a bit. Then add the butter and pulse for 10 seconds at a time until the mixture is well combined. Scoop everything out into a bowl and put in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. The purpose of this cooling process is to harden the mixture slightly for easy handling later.
While the filling is cooling, make the dough. Put the sweet rice flour into a mixing bowl. Slowly add in the warm water, while stirring to form a dough. The dough can’t be too wet, or it will not hold its shape. Cover with a damp towel.
Now boil some water in a small pot, take out a small piece of the dough, about 1” in diameter. Add it to the boiling water and cook the piece of dough until it floats. Scoop it out and add it to the rest of the dough. Mix the two parts together until the dough is soft and smooth. Divide the dough into 12 equal pieces (about 18 grams each, if you want to be really exacting), and roll them into balls. Keep the dough and dough balls covered with a damp paper towel while assembling.
Take out the filling after it’s cooled for 30 minutes. It should be slightly hard, but still workable. Roll the filling into small marble-sized balls, about 4 to 5 grams each. Then take each dough ball and flatten into a circle about 2 inches in diameter. Add the filling to the center, and close the dough over the filling. Roll the ball around in your hands until it's smooth and round. Repeat until all the sesame balls are made. Cover the remaining filling and return to the refrigerator for later!
While you are assembling, bring a medium pot of water to a boil. Add the sesame balls and stir immediately to prevent them from sticking. Adding the sesame balls will cool down the water temperature significantly, so once the water comes back up to a boil, add a 1/2 cup of water to the pot. Repeat this step two more times. This cooking process will allow enough time for the sugar and butter to melt nicely into a smooth filling. Serve the sesame balls in a bit of the hot cooking water!",en-US,"{'calories': '460 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '57 g', 'proteinContent': '5 g', 'fatContent': '25 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '12 g', 'cholesterolContent': '45 mg', 'sodiumContent': '153 mg', 'fiberContent': '3 g', 'sugarContent': '21 g', 'servingSize': '1 serving'}",4.67,,The Woks of Life,100,4 serving(s)

Ham and Nut Mooncakes (Wu Ren Yue Bing 五仁月饼),Judy,https://thewoksoflife.com/ham-nut-mooncake-recipe/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/ham-nut-mooncake-recipe-5-1.jpg,"['½ pound granulated sugar', '½ cup water', 'Juice of half a lemon', '140 ml inverted sugar syrup ((which you bought or made in Part I))', '⅓ cup peanut oil or corn oil', '1 teaspoon lye water ((available at your Chinese grocery store))', '1 ⅔ cups all-purpose flour ((about 250 grams, plus more for dusting))', '100 grams jinhua ham ((京华火腿))', '2 tablespoons ham juice ((from steaming the ham––see instructions below))', '100 grams walnuts ((toasted))', '100 grams cashews ((toasted))', '100 grams pecans ((toasted))', '75 grams pumpkin seeds ((toasted))', '60 grams sunflower seeds ((toasted))', '60 grams sesame seeds ((toasted))', '200 grams sweet rice flour', '⅓ cup peanut oil ((or corn oil, about 75 ml))', '50 grams dried currants', '150 grams granulated sugar', '½ teaspoon salt', '¼ teaspoon five spice powder', '2 tablespoons Chinese bai jiu 白酒', '½ cup water ((about 120 ml))', '[no additional ingredients needed for this step]', '1 egg yolk', '3 tablespoons water']","PART I: Inverted sugar syrup
Heat the sugar and water in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir to dissolve the sugar. Once it’s boiling, add the lemon juice, stir, and immediately turn the heat down to low.
Keep the lid off, and let the syrup simmer for about 60 to 70 minutes until the sugary liquid turns a light amber color. Do not stir during this timeframe! By now, the liquid might look too watery, but it will thicken once it’s cooled. Try not to overcook it, because it will become thick like caramel. (Just in case you do overcook the syrup, and it’s too thick, add a few drops of hot water to thin it out. Keep adding the hot water until you get the right consistency.)
Now, pour the syrup into a heatproof container, and cool completely before storing it in the refrigerator.
PART II: The dough
First, mix the inverted sugar syrup, oil, and lye water together. Then add the flour to the mixture, using a rubber spatula to fold and combine everything into a soft dough.
Do not overwork the dough. This step should only take about a minute or two. Cover the dough in an airtight container or wrap it in plastic wrap. Let it rest in the refrigerator for at least an hour to make it easier to work with. You can also refrigerate the dough overnight if you’d like to make it ahead of time.
PART III: The ham and nut filling
Steam the ham in a heatproof bowl for 15 minutes. You will end up with some liquid in the bowl after it’s done steaming. Save this liquid and set it aside. Finely chop the ham.
If you’re using pre-toasted nuts, you can save some time. If not, toast the raw nuts in a preheated oven at 325 degrees F for 5-10 minutes with each batch. Roast the walnuts, cashews, and pecans together, and roast the pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and sesame seeds in a separate batch. My tip is that once you smell a nutty aroma after 3-4 minutes, stand in front of the oven until the nuts are toasted to your liking. Don’t walk away from the oven, because the nuts can burn quickly! Once cool enough to handle, chop the walnuts, cashews, and pecans, and add them to a large mixing bowl along with the toasted pumpkin, sunflower, and sesame seeds.
In a clean, dry wok, toast the sweet rice flour for 15 to 20 minutes over medium low heat until it turns a light brown color. Stir often, and adjust the heat accordingly to prevent burning.
In a small pot, heat up the oil until it’s lightly smoking. Turn off the heat, and let it cool. Believe it or not, cooking the oil this way adds fragrance and flavor to the mooncakes!
To your mixing bowl full of chopped nuts and seeds, add the chopped ham, currants, sugar, salt, and five spice powder. Mix well. Now add in the liquids: the water from steaming the ham, the bai jiu, the “cooked” peanut oil, and the water. Stir everything to combine.
Lastly, slowly add in the toasted sweet rice flour to bind all the ingredients together. The final mixture should be somewhat dry and slightly crumbly, but you should be able to squeeze everything together tightly and form a ball. If you need to, add a little bit more peanut oil to moisten the mixture.
Weigh and divide the mixture into 18 equal pieces. Form each piece into a ball, and set aside for assembling the mooncakes.
Part IV: Assembling the mooncakes
After the dough is done resting, divide it into 18 equal pieces. My mooncake mold holds 100 grams, which means that each mooncake should weigh about 100 grams after assembly. You should be able to use these guidelines when assembling the mooncakes:
Each dough ball is around 25 to 30 grams. Set aside a smaller dough ball for scraps and mending, which I will get to. Shape each piece into a ball.
Each ball of filling should be around 65 to 70 grams.
Let’s start assembling the mooncakes by preparing the mooncake mold. My mooncake mold came with four pattern plates––one plate should be attached to the mold itself. Wrap another one with clear plastic, because you’ll use it to press the mooncake from the bottom. Now, dust the inside of the mold with plenty of flour, and shake off the excess. You’ll need to repeat this process before pressing every mooncake to avoid sticking.
Dust the balls of dough with flour. Take one ball of dough, and roll it out on a floured surface into a 4-inch round. Put one piece of filling in the center. Carefully lift it up (I use a dough cutter to scrape it up from my work surface), and gently press out the air bubbles without breaking the dough. Next, make sure the opening is facing up, and slowly pinch the dough closed around the filling, keeping the distribution of the dough as even as possible.
The dough feels like Play-doh, so it’s easy to break, but it’s also easy to squish back together. These instructions might sound confusing, but follow along with the pictures, and keep in mind that the chief goal here is to close the dough around the filling without any air pockets. Now dust the assembled ball with additional flour.
Place the ball of dough and filling inside the mooncake mold with the mold opening facing up. Next, press in the bottom piece (with the clear plastic-wrapped plate that you prepared). With some pressure, gently press it inward.
Quickly put the mold down, and press the mooncake out with the top pressure bar. The bottom piece will come out no problem, but use your other hand to VERY GENTLY guide the mooncake out of the mold. When/if a small piece of dough gets stuck and does not come out, get a small piece of your scrap dough to patch up the area. Then clean the mold, and dust it well with flour again. Next, gently flatten all sides of the mooncake to make it smaller, so it can go back in the mooncake mold for re-shaping. Use slightly more flour for dusting if this becomes a persistent issue. Place the mooncakes on a baking sheet as you make them.
PART V: Baking the mooncakes
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F, and put the baking rack in the middle of the oven when you’re almost finished assembling the mooncakes. Once the oven is preheated, gently mist the mooncakes with a food-grade spray bottle (if you have one) filled with water. If you don’t have one, you can just use your hands. Dip your fingers into a bowl of water, and fling the water on your fingers onto the mooncakes a couple of times. This prevents the dough from cracking in the hot oven.
Then, immediately put the mooncakes in the oven, and bake for 5 minutes. (Remember to set the timer!) Now, prepare the egg wash by whisking together an egg yolk with 3 tablespoons of water.
After the mooncakes have been baking for 5 minutes, take them out of the oven and immediately lower the oven temperature to 300 degrees. Using a natural-bristle pastry brush, lightly brush each mooncake with egg wash, and put them back in the oven.
Bake them for another 15 minutes (set a timer!). When the time has elapsed, take them out, and let them cool completely. When the mooncakes first come out of the oven, the dough will look dry like bread, and not oily like what you are used to when opening packaged mooncakes. This is normal.
Store the completely cooled mooncakes in an airtight container for a day or two, and the outside will get that sheen that you recognize and love.",en-US,"{'calories': '450 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '52 g', 'proteinContent': '9 g', 'fatContent': '25 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '3 g', 'cholesterolContent': '14 mg', 'sodiumContent': '182 mg', 'fiberContent': '3 g', 'sugarContent': '29 g', 'servingSize': '1 serving'}",5.0,,The Woks of Life,3000,18 serving(s)

If you don't have a mixer and would like to knead by hand, extend the kneading time by at least 5-10 minutes.
After 15 minutes of mixing, the dough is ready for proofing. Cover the bowl with a damp towel and place in a warm spot for 1 hour. I proofed the dough in my oven (I had the oven on rapid proof for 5 minutes, turned the oven off, and then closed the oven door). The dough will grow to 1½ times its original size.

Red Bean Bread,Judy,https://thewoksoflife.com/red-bean-bread/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/red-bean-bread-91-1.jpg,"['8 ounces dried adzuki beans ((225g))', '¾ cup sugar ((150g))', '6 tablespoons butter ((85g))', '2/3 cup heavy cream ((160 ml, at room temperature))', '1 cup milk ((plus 1 tablespoon, at room temperature; total 250 ml))', '1 large egg ((at room temperature))', '1/3 cup sugar ((75g))', '1/2 cup cake flour ((70g))', '3 1/2 cups bread flour ((500g))', '1 tablespoon active dry yeast ((11g))', '1 1/2 teaspoons salt ((7g))', 'Egg wash ((whisk together 1 egg with 1 teaspoon water))', 'simple syrup ((optional: 8g/2 teaspoons of sugar dissolved in 2 teaspoons hot water))']","First, make the red bean paste:
Start by washing and rinsing the red beans prior to soaking. Soak the red beans overnight. When you're ready to start cooking the paste, pour the red beans and water into a medium-sized pot. Ensure that the water level is about ¼"" above the red beans. Bring to a boil, then turn down the heat to simmer. Cook the beans until completely softened. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.
Since we are making a paste, you don't want a lot of liquid in the beans. Most of the water should be cooked off and the beans should be very thick before you move forward. Be careful, because as more water cooks off, burning the beans is very easy to do. This whole process will take a few hours.
When the beans have a thick consistency, transfer to a food processor. Depending on the size of yours, you may need to process the bean mixture in batches. Process until the mixture is totally smooth. If you like your red bean paste chunky, skip this step or process to desired consistency. Transfer the paste back to the pot.
Heat the paste over medium-low heat. Add the sugar and stir to dissolve. Then add the butter. More butter means a richer paste. You can also use vegetable oil at this step, but butter adds a more pleasant flavor. Cook for an additional 15-20 minutes to cook off even more moisture from the paste.
Quick disclaimer here: It won't look like the packaged red bean paste you get at the store because those pastes have enormous amounts of sugar and oil added to make them sticky and dark. We're going for a more natural Chinese bakery red bean paste here. If you like the store-bought red bean paste, feel free to take a shortcut and use that!
Set aside and let cool for an hour or so before using. Do not refrigerate!
To make the milk bread dough:
To save time, make the milk bread dough while the red bean paste is cooking. In the bowl of a mixer, add the heavy cream, milk, egg, sugar, cake flour, bread flour, yeast, and salt. Use the dough hook attachment, and turn on the mixer to “stir.” Let it go for 15 minutes, occasionally stopping the mixer to push the dough together. If you're in a humid climate and the dough is too sticky, feel free to add a little more flour 1/4 cup at a time until it comes together. The dough should be moist, but not so sticky that it sticks excessively to the bowl or dough hook. If you don't have a mixer and would like to knead by hand, extend the kneading time by 5-10 minutes.
After 15 minutes of mixing, the dough is ready for proofing. Cover the bowl with a damp towel and place in a warm spot for 1 hour. The dough will grow to 1.5X its original size.
Assemble the red bean bread:
Grease one standard loaf pan on all sides with butter. Also, line a cookie sheet with parchment paper.
After the hour of proofing, put the dough back in the mixer and stir for another 5 minutes to get rid of air bubbles. Dump the dough on a lightly floured surface, and cut it in half. Set aside one half for a red bean swirl loaf, and cut the other half into 8 pieces for individual red bean buns.
We'll start with the buns. Here's where the fun part comes in. For each bun, use about 2 tablespoons of red bean paste. For a standard red bean bun, just roll one piece of dough into a ball, flatten with your hand or roll out to half inch thickness and place the red bean filling in the center. Pinch the dough closed around the red bean and place on your cookie sheet, seam-side down.
To make some slightly more interesting shapes, just follow along with the pictures! You can roll them like cinnamon buns, and then make strategic cuts with scissors to add a decorative flair. Check out this post to see how to make the pretty swirl shape shown here.
Okay, now for the red bean swirl loaf. Take the first half of dough and shape into a rectangle. Roll out to a little less than ¾-inch thickness with a floured rolling pin, maintaining a rectangle shape. Now, take a few big dollops of red bean paste and spread over the center of the rectangle, leaving a few inches on either side of the rectangle and one inch along the top and bottom. The paste should be spread to about 1/8-inch thickness.
Fold over each side of the rectangle so a seam runs down the center of the dough. Pinch all the open edges closed.
Next, roll out the dough to flatten the seams and make the rectangle of dough roughly as large as it was when you started. Then, fold the dough into thirds (like you would if you were folding a piece of paper to put into an envelope). Roll it out into a rectangle once more. Add more flour to the dough/board if necessary.
Repeat the step of folding the dough into thirds, but this time, roll it out just so that the layers press together and the piece of dough is the length of the loaf pan. Make two lengthwise cuts in the dough so you have three segments. Braid the pieces with the layered sides facing up. This will make for a really nice pattern when it bakes up. Pinch the ends of the braided dough together and gently place into your buttered loaf pan.
Let the buns and the loaf proof for another hour. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Brush the risen dough with egg wash. Bake the buns for 18-20 minutes and the loaf for 35-45 minutes. Remove from the oven and brush the bread with sugar water to give them a really great shine, sweetness, and color.
These don't keep for too long, so if you don't gobble them up right away, best to store them in the refrigerator and then heat them up in the microwave for 20 seconds. The red bean swirl loaf is excellent sliced, toasted, and served with a little butter.
If you have red bean paste left over, it keeps really well in a tupperware in the fridge. If you want to make another batch of these buns, when the time comes, just warm up the paste ever so slightly in a small pot—just enough to make it easily spreadable.",en-US,"{'calories': '298 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '46 g', 'proteinContent': '8 g', 'fatContent': '9 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '5 g', 'cholesterolContent': '37 mg', 'sodiumContent': '271 mg', 'fiberContent': '3 g', 'sugarContent': '14 g', 'servingSize': '1 serving'}",4.63,,The Woks of Life,405,16 serving(s)

Dissolve 1 tablespoon sugar and 1 teaspoon salt in 2 tablespoons of hot water, and then add an additional 2 ½ tablespoons of cold water. Transfer to the freezer for 20 minutes.
Carefully grate the frozen butter using a box grater or the grating attachment on your food processor. You can also very finely chop it, taking care to minimize contact with your warm hands.
Add 2 1/2 cups all purpose flour to a mixing bowl, along with the grated butter. Combine the butter and flour quickly with your hands for a few seconds.
Drizzle the cold water solution evenly over the flour and butter, and work it with your hands quickly to squeeze it together into 2 balls roughly the same size. It will be a little dry and a tad challenging to ball together, but do your best. Place the dough in airtight reusable silicone bags (or wrap in plastic), and press the balls down into discs.
Transfer the dough discs to the fridge to chill for at least 1 hour (you can also make the dough a day in advance or freeze it if you’d like to make it further in advance).
Make the filling:
While the pie crust is resting, make the filling. Melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a large saute pan over medium high heat. Add the apples, and cook for 3 minutes, stirring to prevent sticking.
Add the cinnamon, lemon juice, and ½ cup of sugar. Cook for 5 minutes, until the apples are somewhat softened. Turn off the heat.
Dissolve the cornstarch in 2 tablespoons of water, and off the heat, pour it into the apple mixture. Stir to thicken. Allow to cool completely—the filling shouldn’t be warm when you add it to the pie shell!
Assemble & bake:
Position a rack in the center of your oven and place a baking sheet on the rack. Preheat the oven to 400°F/200°C.
Remove the dough from the fridge and allow it to sit at room temperature for about 5 minutes to soften slightly, so it’s easier to work with. If one of your dough discs looks larger than the other, take the larger of the two, and roll it out into an 11-12 inch (30 cm) circle. Fold gently in half, and transfer to the pie shell. The dough will break easily, and that’s ok. Patch it and press it back together if needed.
Place the pie shell in the refrigerator while you roll out the top crust. Roll the top crust into a 10-inch circle. Take the pie shell back out of the fridge, and add the cooled filling in an evenly layer. Cover with the top crust, and flute the edges or crimp the edges with a fork.
Brush the crust with egg wash (1 egg beaten with 1 tablespoon of water), and cut vent holes in the top. Place the pie on the heated baking sheet, and bake for 20 minutes.

Set aside. Line your muffin tin with cupcake liners and set aside. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
In the bowl of your electric mixer, beat the butter until light yellow--about 1 minute. Add the light brown sugar and granulated sugar and cream together. Scrape down the bowls as needed. With the mixer on low, add the eggs one at a time, beating after each addition. Add the vanilla and beat on low speed until everything is combined.
With the mixer on, gradually add the dry ingredients and stir until the batter is smooth. Add the pumpkin and stir until thoroughly combined.
Using an ice cream scoop, fill the cupcake liners to about ⅔ of the way full. Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean. Let cool in the pan for 10-15 minutes, and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely before frosting.
While your cupcakes are cooling, prepare your frosting. Using an electric mixer, cream the butter for 2 minutes. Add the vanilla extract, milk, and 4 cups of confectioner’s sugar. Stir until smooth. Add the maple syrup and stir to combine. Next, gradually add one cup of confectioner’s sugar at a time, stirring to combine before adding the next cup. Scrape down the sides of the bowl to ensure all of the butter is incorporated.
Now to divide your frosting into four parts--green, brown, orange, and white colors. Set aside about a ½ cup each for green and brown, about 1¼ cups for orange, and the rest for white.
To achieve the right colors, I used this as a rough guide, but here’s a quick rundown of what I did. For the green frosting, add drops of green food coloring until you have the desired shade. For the brown frosting, add drops of red and yellow in equal parts, adding a few drops of blue to make brown. For the orange, add mostly yellow food coloring, with a few drops of red to intensify the shade of orange.
Next for the cake tips! For the base, we used a standard star tip. Pipe the white frosting in a swirl pattern to create a base, or a “patch” for your pumpkins!
Next, using a regular circle tip, pipe on the pumpkins. Squeeze the frosting out, bouncing your wrist as you go to create a roughly spherical shape. Squeeze out the frosting vertically--don’t swirl for the pumpkins.
Next, using a plastic ziploc bag, cut a very small hole--about 2-3 millimeters in diameter--in one corner of the bag, and fill it with your brown frosting. Squeeze a small amount on each pumpkin to create a stem.
Lastly, for the green frosting, cut a very small small hole--about 1.5-2 millimeters in diameter--in one corner of the bag and fill it with half of your green frosting. Pipe small vines around the pumpkins, swirling and zigzagging as you see fit!
Next, take a cake tip that is vertically oriented with a notch in the center. There are many different kinds of cake tips that will result in different shaped leaves but we found this one to work best for this particular recipe. Make a few practice leaves on a plate before moving into the actual cupcakes. Twist the piping bag at the end of piping out the leaf to give it that organic flair.

Easy Rough Puff Pastry,Bill,https://thewoksoflife.com/easy-rough-puff-pastry/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/rough-puff-pastry-10.jpg,"['6 ounces unsalted butter ((170g or 1 1/2 sticks, frozen or very cold))', '6 to 7 tablespoons ice water', '1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour ((175g))', '¼ teaspoon salt']","Prepare your rough puff pastry ingredients:
If using frozen butter, take it out of the freezer to let it warm up just a bit while preparing other ingredients.
Prepare a cup of cold water and add a few ice cubes to it so it gets ice cold.
Place your mixing bowl into the refrigerator for a few minutes to cool it down.
It’s really important to keep the ingredients (especially the butter) cold so the butter and flour do not mix and meld together. The butter should be distributed throughout the dough Keeping the butter and flour separate creates the lamination, or layers, in the puff pastry.
Make the rough puff pastry dough:
Mix together the flour and salt in your chilled bowl.
Use a hand grater to grate your cold butter on top of the flour and salt. Work quickly so the butter stays cold.
Mix flour, salt, and grated butter together until the mixture turns coarse and crumbly.
Add 6 tablespoons ice water one tablespoon at a time and mix with a rubber spatula before adding the next one until the dough comes together. Add another tablespoon of ice water if you see there is an excess of flour in the bowl and the dough is dry.
Now you can use your hands to press the dough together into a ball and quickly form a rough disk. At this stage, the puff pastry dough will be a little shaggy and streaky which is ok. Make sure you do not overwork the dough.
Immediately wrap your rough puff pastry dough in plastic wrap and chill it in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes or in the freezer for 15 minutes.
First turn: roll and fold your rough puff pastry:
Flour a surface, preferably a stone countertop to keep the dough cool and flour your rolling pin thoroughly as well.
After the dough has chilled, transfer it to a floured surface (reserve the plastic wrap for use again) and use a rolling pin to roll it out into a 6x15 inch rectangle (15x38 cm). Use the rolling pin or your hands to push the edges of the dough inward if they begin to crack; keep your rectangle’s edges straight and not rounded. No need to be obsessive, but neatness does matter to creating uniform layers.
When rolling out the dough, it is important to work quickly to keep the dough cool.
Fold one side of the puff pastry dough over the top of the middle third of the dough and fold the remaining third of the dough on top of that.
Brush off any excess flour from the dough, re-wrap the pastry in the piece of plastic wrap you saved, and chill in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes or in the freezer for 15 minutes.
I suggest keeping the same rolling surface untouched and ready for the next “turn.”
Second turn: roll and fold your rough puff pastry twice:
Roll the dough out again into a 6x15 inch rectangle (15x38 cm).
Fold one side of the puff pastry dough over the top of the middle third of the dough and fold the remaining third of the dough on top of that.
Rotate the dough 90 degrees and repeat the same process, rolling out the dough again into another 6x15 inch rectangle and folding the pastry into thirds.
Brush off any loose flour, wrap the pastry again in plastic, and chill in the refrigerator for another 30 minutes or in the freezer for 15 minutes.
Third turn: roll and fold your rough puff pastry twice:
For your third and final turn, repeat the same steps you performed in the second turn. Wrap and return to the refrigerator.
The pastry can be used 90 minutes after the last time you rolled it. You can also leave the pastry in the freezer for up to a month as long as it is sealed tightly in plastic wrap.",en-US,"{'calories': '149 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '10 g', 'proteinContent': '1 g', 'fatContent': '12 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '7 g', 'cholesterolContent': '30 mg', 'sodiumContent': '51 mg', 'fiberContent': '1 g', 'sugarContent': '1 g', 'servingSize': '1 serving'}",5.0,,The Woks of Life,270,12 serving(s)
Blueberry Pancakes,Bill,https://thewoksoflife.com/blueberry-pancakes/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/blueberry-pancakes-7-1.jpg,"['1½ cups all-purpose flour', '1 tablespoon baking powder', '¼ teaspoon baking soda', '¼ teaspoon salt', '3 tablespoons sugar ((divided))', '1¼ cups fresh blueberries ((washed and drained))', '1 egg ((at room temperature))', '1 cup whole milk ((at room temperature))', '3 tablespoons butter ((melted and partially cooled))', '½ teaspoon lemon zest ((optional))']","Sift all of the dry ingredients together into a bowl––with the exception of 1 tablespoon of sugar––and set aside. Sifting helps to make a fluffy pancake, which is especially important when incorporating fresh fruit into the batter.
In a medium-sized bowl, sprinkle 1 tablespoon of sugar over the blueberries. I like this step, because it sweetens the blueberries slightly and helps bring out their true taste. If you have very sweet blueberries, you can omit this step.
Lightly beat 1 egg in a large mixing bowl, and add the milk. Make sure that you take these ingredients out in advance so they are at room temperature. Add in the sifted dry ingredients, and gently stir the batter, being careful not to over-mix. A few lumps in the batter at this stage is okay.
Next, carefully fold in the melted butter until completely incorporated. Be sure that it’s cooled slightly, or that your batter is at room temperature. This is important, or your butter will solidify when mixed with the cold ingredients. If you’re including the lemon zest, add it in now. Let the batter sit for 20 minutes.
After your batter has rested, fold in the blueberries. Now, we’re ready to get some pancakes over the fire! Heat up your cast iron pan or griddle. Cast iron is great for making pancakes, since they retain and maintain a constant heat--essential for making good pancakes!
Use a small dab of butter to coat the pan each time you drop in a new pancake. Heat control is everything when making pancakes, so be sure the butter sizzles when you put it down, but does not brown quickly; if it does, turn the heat down slightly.
Spoon 1/3 cup of batter (or ½ cup for larger pancakes) into the pan. The pancake is ready to flip once bubbles have formed across the pancake, and the bottom is golden brown and slightly crispy (about 2½ minutes). You can use a spatula to gently lift the edge of the pancake to take a peek.
Be careful flipping the pancake, because it will be a little unwieldy with the blueberries. You must be assertive, using a single motion--and flip only once! Let the pancake cook for another 1½ minutes, and transfer to a warm plate. Depending upon how large your pancake is and how you control the flame, the cooking times may vary by 30 seconds or so.
Repeat until all the pancakes are done, or you can eat as you cook so the pancakes are piping hot.

Our Favorite Chocolate Cake Recipe (a PSA),Kaitlin,https://thewoksoflife.com/chocolate-cake-recipe/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/chocolate-cake-10.jpg,"['2 tablespoons unsalted butter ((for greasing the pans))', '1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour ((plus more for pans))', '2 cups sugar', ""3/4 cups cocoa powder ((Hershey's Special Dark is especially good for this recipe!))"", '2 teaspoons baking soda', '1 teaspoon baking powder', '1 teaspoon salt', '1 cup buttermilk', '1/2 cup vegetable oil', '2 extra large eggs ((at room temperature))', '1 teaspoon vanilla', '1 cup freshly brewed hot coffee ((the stronger the better))', '6 ounces semisweet or bittersweet chocolate ((baking chocolate or chocolate chips are both fine))', '2 sticks unsalted butter ((at room temperature))', '1 extra large egg yolk ((at room temperature))', '1 teaspoon vanilla', ""1 1/4 cups confectioners' sugar"", '1 tablespoon instant coffee powder ((optional))']","Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and butter two 8-inch round cake pans. Grab some parchment paper and trace two outlines of the cake pan. Cut out the outlines (Perfect circles, voilá!) and place a sheet of parchment into each of your pans. Then butter and flour the pans again with the parchment paper in the bottom.
Sift the flour, sugar, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder, and salt into the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, and mix on low speed until combined. In a separate bowl or large measuring cup, combine the buttermilk, oil, eggs, and vanilla. With the mixer on low speed, slowly add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients.
Now grab your brewed coffee, and with the mixer still on low, slowly add the coffee. Mix just to combine, scraping the bottom of the bowl with a spatula to make sure everything's thoroughly mixed. The resulting batter will be quite thin.
Divide the batter evenly between the two pans and bake for 35 to 40 minutes, until a toothpick comes out clean. Let the cakes cool in the pans for 30 minutes, and then (carefully) turn them out onto a cooling rack to cool completely. If you didn’t use the parchment paper, definitely grab a butter knife to loosen the cakes first. The moist crumb makes these guys pretty delicate.
While the cakes are cooling, prepare your chocolate frosting.
Measure out your chocolate (if using bars, chop into pieces first) and place in a heat-proof bowl set over a small pot of simmering water. Stir until just melted and set aside until cooled to room temperature. Another cheat—it can be a little warm. Your frosting will be safe.
While that's happening, use your electric mixer + paddle attachment to beat 2 sticks of butter on medium-high speed until light yellow and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the egg yolk and vanilla and continue beating for 3 minutes.
With the mixer on low, gradually add the confectioners' sugar. The original recipe says to sift it—but really, just beat the frosting a little longer to get rid of any clumps! Continue to beat at medium speed, scraping down the bowl as necessary, until the frosting is smooth and creamy. Then add in the chocolate and beat until combined. Be careful not to over-whip the frosting.
At this point, you can dissolve the instant coffee powder in 2 teaspoons of hot water, and add it into the frosting. This step is optional.
Now, to frost the cake! Place the first cake layer on a flat plate or cake pedestal. Ina says flat side up. I say whichever the less mauled side is should be facing up. With a butter knife or offset spatula, spread with frosting—a little more than a ¼-inch thick. Carefully place the second layer on top, and spread the frosting evenly on the top and sides of the cake.",en-US,"{'calories': '592 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '72 g', 'proteinContent': '6 g', 'fatContent': '33 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '22 g', 'cholesterolContent': '90 mg', 'sodiumContent': '423 mg', 'fiberContent': '3 g', 'sugarContent': '52 g', 'servingSize': '1 serving'}",4.94,,The Woks of Life,95,12 serving(s)

When half of the butter is melted, add the marshmallows. Stir the marshmallows until they’re entirely melted. Be patient with this process--if the marshmallow starts to get toasted, lower the heat--everything should stay completely white with no browning or toasting.
While this is happening, you can set up a double-boiler with the chocolate. Stir until melted. When the marshmallow mixture is smooth, add the cereal. Stir quickly and thoroughly to combine. Turn out onto a piece of wax paper or parchment paper. With wet hands, shape the rice krispie treats into a rectangle, about ¾-1” thick.

Add the butter and break it up roughly with your fingers, making sure to keep visible little chunks of butter in the dough. Add 2 tablespoons of cold water and bring the dough together. Add a tiny bit more water if necessary, but not too much. Cover the dough and refrigerate for 20 minutes.
Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured board, knead gently, and form into a neat rectangle. Roll the dough away from you (not back and forth), forming a 20 x 50cm rectangle (about 8x20 inches). Try to keep the edges even, and don’t overwork the butter streaks. Flecks of butter should still be visible in the dough.
Fold the top third of the dough down to the center, then the bottom third up and over that. Give the dough a quarter turn (left or right) and roll out again to three times the length. Fold the same way as before, cover, and chill for 30 minutes.
While the dough is resting, make the filling. Dissolve 1/2 cup sugar into the cup of hot water, and allow to cool to room temperature. Whisk eggs and evaporated milk together and then thoroughly whisk in the sugar water and vanilla. Strain through a very fine mesh strainer--this step is extremely important to getting a smooth, glassy egg tart.

Press the dough into the tins and use a ladle to fill each tart shell until just reaching the edges of the outside crust. Once filled, immediately (but very carefully) transfer the pan to the oven and bake for 15 minutes. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F/180 degrees C and bake another 10-12 minutes, until filling is just set (if a toothpick can stand up in it, it’s done).

Use the dough hook attachment, and turn on the mixer to “stir.” Let it go for 15 minutes, occasionally stopping the mixer to push the dough together. If you're in a humid climate and the dough is too sticky, feel free to add a little more flour ¼ cup at a time until it comes together. If you don't have a mixer and would like to knead by hand, extend the kneading time by 5-10 minutes.
After 15 minutes of mixing, the dough is ready for proofing. Cover the bowl with a damp towel and place in a warm spot for 1 hour. The dough will grow to 1.5X its original size.
Meanwhile, prepare your filling and topping. To make the filling, heat 2 tablespoons oil in a wok over medium high heat. Add the onion and stir-fry for 2 minutes. Add the sugar, soy sauce, oyster sauce, sesame oil, and dark soy. Stir and cook until it starts to bubble up. Add the water and flour. Reduce the heat to medium low and cook, stirring, for a couple minutes until thickened. Remove from the heat and stir in the roast pork. Set aside to cool.
To prepare the topping, add the dry milk powder to a mixing bowl. If your dry milk powder has some larger clumps, crush them up with your fingers so it’s uniformly powdery. Add the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and superfine sugar. Stir to combine. Add the shortening, milk, egg yolk, and vanilla. Use your hands to mix everything together into a dough. If it’s too dry, add a little more milk a teaspoon at a time until it comes together. Cover with an overturned bowl or plate, and set aside at room temperature.
After the hour of proofing, put the dough back in the mixer and stir for another 5 minutes to get rid of air bubbles. You can also knead by hand. Dump the dough onto a lightly floured surface, and cut it into 18 equal pieces.
To assemble, divide the topping mixture into 18 equal pieces and roll each into a ball. Roll each ball out into a flat circle using a rolling pin.
Take a piece of bread dough, and flatten with your hands into a rough circle. Put a heaping tablespoon of pork filling in the middle, and wrap the dough around it. Roll into a smooth ball between your hands, and place on a parchment-lined baking sheet, seam-side down. Top the bun with a circle of topping.
Continue assembling until all the buns are made. Cover with a clean, damp towel and allow to rise for another hour.

Sift together the cake flour, cornstarch, and baking powder. Sift them twice. Sounds kind of fussy, but it’s a necessary step to making this cake light and airy.
In a large bowl, whisk together the 3 egg yolks and 2 ½ tablespoons sugar. Whisk in the oil and the milk until it’s light yellow and fully emulsified. Thoroughly fold in the sifted dry ingredients until there are no lumps. Set aside.
Using an electric mixer with the whisk attachment, whip the egg whites until you get soft peaks. Add another 2 ½ tablespoons of sugar to the egg whites and whip until you get stiff peaks.
Taking 1/3 of the egg white mixture at a time, fold it into the egg yolk mixture create a light and airy batter. Make sure everything is thoroughly combined. Line your baking pan with parchment paper. You can cut the four corners of the paper and overlap it to create smooth corners.
Pour the mixture in the pan and smooth it out so it’s completely even. It’s crucial that the batter be evenly distributed in the pan. Knock the bottom of the pan on a tabletop a few times (you can cover the table’s surface with a kitchen towel to make sure you don’t break anything) to get rid of any large air bubbles.
Place the pan onto a rimmed baking sheet and pour a cup of water into the baking sheet, so your pan is sitting in a shallow water bath. Place your whole apparatus on the middle rack of your oven and bake for 15 minutes.
Remove from the oven and let it just cool enough to handle . Flip the pan out onto another piece of parchment paper. Carefully peel off the parchment paper that the cake baked with.
In a mixer, whip the cream along with a teaspoon of sugar until you get stiff peaks. When the cake is still warm enough to be pliable but not warm enough to melt your cream, spread the whipped cream evenly onto the cake.
To roll the cake up, taking out a rolling pin and place it underneath the parchment paper your cake is sitting on. Slowly roll the parchment paper onto the rolling pin one side as you roll up the cake on the other. Essentially, you’re using the rolling pin to push the cake forward as you roll.

Portuguese Custard Tarts (Pasteis de Nata),Bill,https://thewoksoflife.com/portuguese-custard-tarts-pasteis-de-nata/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/portuguese-custard-tarts-3.jpg,"['420 g homemade rough puff pastry', '½ cup heavy cream ((35% fat dairy cream, 118 ml))', '½ cup sugar ((granulated white sugar, 115 g))', '1 ¼ cup whole milk ((300 ml, 3.5% milk fat))', '2 egg yolks', '4 teaspoons cornstarch ((11 g))', '1¼ teaspoon vanilla extract']","Make the pastry shells:
Roll out the puff pastry into a 10x12 inch (25x30 cm) rectangle. From the 10-inch side, start rolling the pastry into a tight roll until you have a 10-inch long roll. Return the pastry to the freezer for 30 minutes to chill until firm.
Cut the chilled pastry roll into 12 equal disks that weigh about 35 g each (cut the pastry in half twice, and then cut each of the remaining 4 pieces into 3 equal pieces to get a total of 12). You can also use a ruler for this purpose. Start with 6 pieces first, wrap the rest up, and put them back in the refrigerator or freezer to keep them chilled.
On a very lightly floured surface, place each piece of dough so the swirls in the dough are facing up. Use a rolling pin to roll each piece into a flat disc about ¼ inch wider than the diameter of the tin and about 3/16 inches thick. Use flour sparingly when rolling out the discs. Using a pastry scraper or metal spatula to lift the discs will help keep them intact.
Place each disk onto the bottom of each custard tart tin and press the dough onto the tin. When you spread the dough into the tart tin, form a lip that sits on top of the perimeter of the tin. This is crucial for preventing the custard from overflowing. Work quickly so your dough doesn’t heat up. Have some all-purpose flour on the table in case the dough sticks to your fingers, and as you press the dough against the bottom and the sides of the tin, try not to overwork it.
Freeze the finished tart cups for at least 35 minutes or until frozen. You can make the pastry tins ahead of time and keep them frozen for up to 2 weeks.
Make the custard filling:
Whisk ½ cup heavy cream, ½ cup sugar, 1¼ cup whole milk, 2 egg yolks, 4 teaspoons cornstarch, and 1¼ teaspoon vanilla extract in a small saucepan until the sugar is dissolved.
Place over medium low heat, continuing to whisk until the mixture begins to coat the sides of the pan. Patience and low heat are key to a successful custard. The custard should get just hot enough so you see steam beginning to form. This is your signal that the custard is almost ready.
When the custard is thick enough to coat a spoon, remove from the heat and continue to whisk, ensuring you scrape the sides of the pan. Whisk until it is no longer hot. Do not cook the custard into a pudding, or it will dry out too much during baking! It’s a fairly thin consistency.
Set aside to cool completely, pressing plastic wrap onto the surface of the custard so a skin does not form on top.
Assembly and baking:
Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C). Place the frozen pastry shells on a sheet pan (you can line it with parchment paper for easy cleanup).
Spoon the cooled custard in each shell until the custard is about 3/16 inches below the top of the pastry shell. Work quickly since you don’t want to give the custard any chance of soaking into the pastry. It’s important to have the oven ready to go once you start pouring custard into the shells.
Put the pan on the middle rack of your oven, and immediately turn the oven temperature down to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). The total baking time for your Portuguese Custard Tarts should be 30 minutes, but check them after 20 minutes and rotate the pan if they are browning unevenly.
After 25 minutes, if the pastry is turning golden brown and you see those signature scorched bubbles forming, you’re on track for another 5 minutes. If the pastry looks like it is browning too fast, you may want to turn the heat off to let residual heat finish the baking process. Oven temperatures are not always accurate and may be slightly hotter or cooler than the temperature you set it for, so play it by ear.
When baking is complete, remove the custard tarts from the oven (leaving them in the tins), and place on a rack to cool.
Your Portuguese Custard Tarts will smell incredible, but be sure to wait until they cool, as the custard will be extremely hot. Once they are cool enough to handle, remove the custard tarts from the tins and enjoy them warm!

In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, 2 tablespoons sugar, and a teaspoon of salt. Add in the chilled shortening and cut it in with a pastry cutter or two butter knives. Once that’s looking crumbly, cut in the chilled butter until it resembles coarse crumbs. Work quickly to keep the ingredients cold.
Sprinkle 5-6 tablespoons of ice water into the mixture and stir it in until it forms a dough (if you’re in a dry climate, you may need a couple extra tablespoons). Divide the dough into two pieces and place each one on a piece of plastic wrap. Flatten them into disks, wrap them up, and put them in the fridge for at least an hour.
To peel the peaches, bring a pot of water to a boil and prepare an ice bath. Cut an x in the bottom of each peach. Blanch the peaches in boiling water for 40-60 seconds (less time for really ripe peaches, more time for peaches that might be a little less ripe). Remove from the pot with a slotted spoon and dunk into the ice bath. Let them cool in the ice water for at least a minute, and the peel will come right off!
Once the dough is ready to roll, adjust an oven rack to the lowest position, place a rimmed baking sheet on the rack, and heat the oven to 500 degrees. Toss the pitted, sliced peaches with ¾-1 cup sugar (depending on how tart/sweet your peaches are), 3 tablespoons tapioca starch, lemon juice, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt.
Take one of the dough disks out of the fridge and let it sit for a couple minutes. Sprinkle some flour onto a clean surface, and roll the crust into a 12-inch circle. Spread it into the pie pan. Check your fruit at this point. If it’s looking like the peaches released a lot of juice, stir in up to 2 more tablespoons of the tapioca starch.
Roll out the other disk into a 10-inch circle. Spread the peaches into the piecrust bottom and lay the top crust over the pie. Seal and crimp the edges and cut six vent holes in the top. Lightly brush the pie with egg white and sprinkle with the last teaspoon of sugar.
Place the pie on the heated baking sheet and lower the temperature to 425 degrees. Bake for 25 minutes.

Use an electric mixer, and beat on high for 5 minutes until well-combined and fluffy.
Scrape the bottom of the bowl and add 1½ teaspoons vanilla extract, ⅓ cup evaporated milk, and 1½ tablespoons custard powder. Beat for 1 minute.
Sift 1 cup cake flour, ⅛ teaspoon salt, and 3½ teaspoons baking powder. Fold into the batter gently until incorporated. Try to break up any large lumps, but don’t overwork the batter––some smaller lumps are okay!
Let the batter sit for 30 minutes. The dry ingredients absorb, and the baking powder has a chance to do its thing. While the batter is resting, line a 9 inch bamboo steamer basket with parchment paper. You can also use a 9 inch cake pan greased with vegetable shortening or butter and lightly coated with all-purpose flour. Lightly buttering and flouring the metal cake pan is important step, even if it is non-stick!
Gently stir the batter again in a folding motion—just enough to ensure the batter is mixed uniformly, but not too much since air pockets have already started to form in the batter. You will also see that the batter has thickened and most lumps have disappeared.
Pour the batter into the bamboo steamer basket lined with parchment paper or your prepared cake pan. Let the batter sit and settle for another 10 minutes while you heat up your steamer.
Place the Ma Lai Go into your steamer setup of choice, and steam on medium high heat—for 30 minutes if using a bamboo steamer, and 35 minutes if using a metal cake pan.

Remove and discard the bitter green center. (Or buy lotus seed halves and skip this step.) Rinse under running water, place in a bowl, and cover with fresh water. Soak overnight.
The next day, drain the lotus seeds and rinse them again. In a pot, add the soaked seeds along with 4 cups (950 ml) of water. The water level should be above the lotus seeds, so make sure you're not using a pot that is too shallow or wide.
Turn on the heat, and bring the mixture to a boil. Once boiling, turn the heat down to low. Simmer the seeds for 30 minutes. The seeds are done once they’re soft, but still maintain their shape. Cool completely, and drain.
In a food processor, puree the cooked lotus seeds until smooth (it’s best to do this in two batches). Transfer the purée to a non-stick pan, cast-iron pan, or thick-bottomed Dutch oven (to avoid sticking/burning).
Place over medium low heat, and constantly stir the purée using a rubber spatula, for 30 minutes. While stirring, add the powdered sugar and oil in 3 alternating batches spaced 5-10 minutes apart, starting with the sugar. With each batch, make sure the sugar and oil is well incorporated before adding more. The lotus paste is done once it can hold its shape. It will be slightly firm, but also soft.

You can use our recipe for sweet red bean paste, or opt for store-bought. Our original recipe makes a large batch, but you can freeze leftovers to make other recipes. To make the exact amount needed for this recipe, scale the serving size down from 21 to 4 in the recipe card. The filling must be cooled completely and can be made up to several days in advance.
In a large mixing bowl, add 1 teaspoon sugar to ¼ cup warm water, and stir in the yeast until dissolved. Let sit for 15 minutes until the yeast foams up.
Next, stir in the milk and add the flour, powdered sugar, and salt. With the dough hook attachment, turn the mixer on low. Let the mixer go for 5 minutes, or knead by hand for 8 minutes, or until the dough is soft and smooth. The dough should not stick to your hands or the bowl.
Cover with a plate to proof for 1 hour in a warm spot, or until the dough doubles in size. I proof the dough inside my closed microwave with a large mug of just boiled water next to it.
While the dough is proofing, roll 8 balls of red bean filling between your palms. Each should weigh about 25g. Cover them with a damp towel to prevent them from drying out. Set aside.
Cut out eight 3""x 3"" squares of parchment paper for the buns to sit on in the steamer.
Once the dough is done proofing, put it back in the mixer and knead for another 2 to 3 minutes to get rid of any air bubbles (or knead by hand). Transfer to a clean, lightly floured surface. Use a kitchen scale to equally divide the dough into 8 pieces (mine were 50g apiece). Cover with a clean kitchen towel while you assemble the buns.
To assemble, roll a dough ball into a 4-inch disc, making the edges slightly thinner than the center. Put one ball of red bean filling in the center of the dough. Gather the edges of the dough around the filling, and pinch the edges together to close the opening.
Place the dough seam side down on a parchment square, and transfer to your steaming rack. The buns need at least 1-inch of space between each other. Repeat with the remaining dough until all the buns are assembled.
Prepare your steamer with about 5 cups of warm water. Put the buns in the steamer and cover. Your steamer water should be lukewarm to help with proofing, but do not turn on the heat at this time. Let them proof for 30 minutes.
Now turn the heat on to medium/high. Set your timer for 15 minutes, during which the heat will slowly bring the water to a boil and steam the buns. It may seem slow to heat in the beginning, but don’t be tempted to disturb the buns or remove the lid.
After the 15-minutes have elapsed, turn off the heat, and let the buns sit in the steamer with the lid tightly covered for another 5 minutes. DO NOT UNCOVER THE LID AT ANY POINT DURING THE STEAMING AND POST-STEAMING TIME. The buns need 5 minutes to set, or they will collapse and become wrinkly, so be patient. They can only be revealed after the final 5-minute timer goes off!

Cantonese Steamed Custard Buns (Nai Wong Bao),Judy,https://thewoksoflife.com/nai-wong-bao-custard-buns/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/nai-wong-bao-18-1.jpg,"['2 eggs', ""½ cup powdered sugar ((also known as confectioner's sugar or icing sugar, 60g))"", '¼ cup milk ((60 ml))', '3 tablespoons heavy cream ((45 ml))', '3 tablespoons all-purpose flour ((25g))', '¼ cup cornstarch ((or wheat starch, 30g))', '¼ cup dry milk powder ((30g))', '2 tablespoons melted butter ((30g))', '1 teaspoon yeast ((2g))', '¼ cup warm water', '1½ cups all purpose flour ((235 grams))', '3 tablespoons powdered sugar ((22g))', '¼ teaspoon salt', '3 tablespoons coconut milk ((45 ml))', '3 tablespoons milk ((45 ml, added 1 tablespoon at a time; the quantity may vary depending on humidity))']","Start by making the filling. Heat some water in a medium to large, deep pot. The water should be about 2 inches deep, and the pan should be large enough to accommodate the mixing bowl. Once the water boils, turn the heat to down to a simmer.
In a large heatproof bowl or the metal mixing bowl that came with your stand mixer, add the eggs and powdered sugar. Beat for a minute on low. Next, add the milk and heavy cream, and beat for a few seconds to combine. Then sift in the flour, starch, and dried milk powder. Mix everything in until there are no lumps. Now add in the melted butter, and stir to combine.
Next, carefully lower the mixing bowl into the pan of water, and begin stirring the mixture quickly and continuously. I used a stainless steel mixing bowl, so the egg mixture solidified rather quickly--it took about a minute. It’s essential that you stir quickly in this process. It may take longer if you use a thicker bowl. Once the egg mixture solidifies into a thick custard, remove from the heat. Do not overcook! Let it cool completely, and it’s ready to use.
Cover the custard to prevent it from drying out while you make the dough. Note: If you’d like to make the filling a day or two early, store it in an air-tight container and refrigerate it.
Now make the dough. In a large mixing bowl, dissolve the yeast in ¼ cup of warm water. Let sit for 10-15 minutes until you see yeast bubbles floating on top of the water.
Now add in the flour, powdered sugar, salt, and coconut milk. Turn on the mixture with the dough hook attachment and set it to low, then slowly add in the regular milk, one tablespoon at a time until a dough is formed. A perfect dough should not stick to your hands or to the bowl--the texture should be smooth like a baby’s bottom!
Cover the dough with a dry kitchen towel, and let it proof for 1 hour. I usually proof my dough in my microwave with the door closed and a mug of just-boiled water next to it. While the dough is proofing, let’s prepare a few things:
Equally divide the egg custard filling into 12 pieces and roll them in your palms to form round balls. Cover them to prevent them from drying out. Prepare the steamer. With this recipe, we will start steaming with cold water, so there is no need to pre-boil the water. Cut out twelve 4""x4"" pieces of parchment paper.
The proofed dough should be about 2½-3 times its original size. Once the dough has finished proofing, put it back in the mixer and let it go for another 2-3 minutes to get rid of any air bubbles.
Now, transfer the dough to a clean and lightly floured surface. With the help of your kitchen scale, equally divide the dough into 12 pieces, and cover with a dry kitchen towel while you assemble the buns. Take one dough ball, roll it out into a 4-inch disc, taking care to make sure the edges are slightly thinner than the center. Put a ball of custard filling on top, pleat, and close the top of the bun--see the video! Place it on a piece of pre-cut parchment paper, and set it on your steaming rack. Repeat until all of the buns are assembled.
Put the buns in the steamer filled with warm water, covered with the lid (do not turn on the heat at this time). Let them sit and proof for another 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, turn the heat on and set it to medium. Set your timer for 12 minutes. During these 12 minutes, the medium heat will slowly bring the water to a boil and steam the buns. It may seem slow and lack action at the beginning, but trust me, the buns will be steamed nicely after just 12 minutes.
VERY IMPORTANT NOTE!!! After the 12-minute timer (for steaming) goes off, set the timer for another 5 minutes and turn off the heat. DO NOT UNCOVER THE LID. The buns need about 5 minutes to cool and set or they will collapse, so be patient. They can only be revealed after the 5-minute timer goes off.
Eat them while they are hot, just like you would if they were straight off the dim sum cart. You can also freeze the leftover buns in a zip-lock bag, and just re-steam when you want to have a bun for a rainy day!",en-US,"{'calories': '167 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '25 g', 'proteinContent': '5 g', 'fatContent': '5 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '3 g', 'cholesterolContent': '39 mg', 'sodiumContent': '97 mg', 'fiberContent': '1 g', 'sugarContent': '9 g', 'servingSize': '1 serving'}",4.66,,The Woks of Life,195,12 serving(s)

Preheat your oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch springform pan and wrap the bottom in foil (you’re going to be putting the cheesecake in a water bath, and you don’t want the water to seep into the pan from the bottom).
Break up the graham crackers into smaller pieces and put them in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse until they’ve turned into crumbs. Add the melted butter and process again until the mixture resembles wet sand. Press evenly into the bottom of the springform pan, packing the crumbs down as tightly as you can.
In the bowl of a mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, add the tofu cream cheese and mix on low speed until light and creamy. Add the sugar and mix on low speed until smooth. Blend in the oat milk on low speed as well. Add in the eggs one at a time, mixing just until incorporated. Then mix in the vanilla, lemon zest, cinnamon, salt, and flour. Do not over-mix or allow too much air into the mixture.
Pour the filling into your prepared crust. Tap the pan against the counter a few times to get rid of any air bubbles, and place it in a rimmed baking sheet filled with 1 cm of water.
Transfer the entire apparatus to the oven and bake for 20 minutes, then lower the heat to 275F and bake for 50 minutes more. Do not open the oven door! After the baking time has elapsed, turn the heat off and let cool in the oven for 2 hours.

Meanwhile, make the mandarin orange syrup. In a small saucepan, add the water and sugar. Bring to a simmer, stirring frequently. Simmer for 3 minutes, until the sugar is completely dissolved.
Dissolve the cornstarch in the juice of 1 mandarin orange, and pour it into the pot, stirring constantly. Strain through a fine-meshed strainer (to remove any large bits of pulp or seeds) and transfer back into the pot. Simmer until the syrup is bubbly, no longer foamy, and thickened.

On a sheet pan lined with parchment paper, add 24 dollops of peanut butter, each about 1 teaspoon. Place in the freezer and allow to harden for at least 1 hour, but preferably 3 hours. You can also do this overnight.
Preheat your oven to 425 degrees F. In a food processor, pulse the dry ingredients together (2 cups all purpose flour, 1 tablespoon baking powder, ¼ cup sugar, ½ teaspoon salt). Sprinkle in the butter cubes and pulse until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs with a few slightly larger butter lumps, about 12 pulses. If you don’t have a food processor, whisk the dry ingredients together in a bowl, and cut in the butter using 2 butter knives or a pastry blender. Transfer to a large mixing bowl.
Next, process the peanuts until you have a mix of fine and coarse crumbs. Mix with 1 tablespoon of sugar and set aside.
Mix the beaten egg yolk with the sour cream and stir into the dry mixture to make the dough. At this point, if the dough is still dry and not coming together, drizzle in 3 tablespoons of milk 1 tablespoon at a time until the dough is formed (you may not need all 3 tablespoons). Just before the dough fully comes together, sprinkle over the frozen peanut butter chunks.
Gently mix with your hands to bring the dough together and distribute the peanut butter chunks. They’ll smear a little bit, but try to keep them as whole as possible. Do not overwork the dough. As soon as the dough is cohesive enough to form into scones, you’re good to go.
On a floured surface, shape the dough into a square, about 1 inch thick. Cut the large square into 4 smaller squares, and then cut each small square in half on the diagonal to form 8 triangles. Transfer the scones to a parchment lined baking sheet, spaced a couple inches apart.
Using your fingers, make a crosshatch in each scone with your finger. You’re making a “well” to put the jam into. Using a spoon, carefully spoon the jam into the well. If you need to soften your jam to do this, microwave it for 15 seconds to loosen it up. Brush the scones with the 2 tablespoons of milk, avoiding the jelly, and sprinkle with the peanut sugar.

Now prepare the sauce by mixing the sugar, vinegar, ½ teaspoon salt, and sesame oil together. Stir to dissolve, and set aside.
Take your potato starch, and slowly drain out the majority of the water, leaving behind the potato starch paste. Add the pork slices to the bowl, and use your hands to ensure the pork is completely coated in the wet potato starch. Add a tablespoon of water at a time if the mixture is too dry and hard to work with.
Prepare the oil for frying in a deep pot or wok, heating it slowly to 250 - 300 degrees F––no higher, or the pork will overcook. Carefully lower the pork pieces, one at a time, into the oil, leaving space in between, as they tend to stick together. Fry each batch for 2 minutes, transferring the fried pork to a wire rack to drain. When all of the pork has been fried once, bring the oil back up to 250 - 300 degrees F and fry the pork again in batches for about 30 seconds each batch.

I take fresh, ripe peaches, peel them, and gently crush them with a fork to release juices and flavor with minimal equipment and cleanup! Ripe, in-season peaches are really easy to peel, even without the trick of blanching them first to loosen the peels. If you’re wondering if your peach is ripe enough, make an “X” in the bottom of the peach with a paring knife. Grab the little corners of skin, and they should peel away easily. If not, make an “X” in the bottom of the peach and then blanch it in boiling water for 30-60 seconds. The peel will come right off. But keep in mind, it’s delicious, tree-ripened fruit that makes these peach pancakes great!
In a large bowl, sift together the flour, sugar, salt, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and nutmeg. In a measuring cup, measure out the milk, and then crack in an egg and beat until well-combined. Beat in the vanilla. Add this wet mixture to the batter, and fold gently just until combined. Fold in the crushed peaches, followed by the melted butter. Don’t overmix––a few lumps are okay!
Let the batter stand at room temperature for 30 minutes. The batter should thicken slightly as the dry ingredients completely absorb the liquids. Fold in more flour if the batter is too thin from super juicy peaches since thin batter will result in less fluffy pancakes. This is where you need to have a bit of judgement according to your peaches.
Heat your cast iron skillet over medium heat. Make sure you preheat the cast iron pan thoroughly before dropping in any butter/pancake batter. You can adjust the heat as needed until the butter sizzles when you add it to the pan and spread it around, but doesn’t immediately brown (that’s a sign it’s too hot!). Good butter placement is key to the signature look of a good pancake.
Brush the pan with a small pat of butter or spread it around with a butter knife, and pour ½ cup of batter for each pancake onto your pan or griddle.Cook until bubbles form on the top of the pancake, and the bottom of the pancake is golden brown.
Flip the pancake once, and cook until the pancake springs back when pressed in the center (about 90 seconds). Transfer to a serving plate and repeat with the rest of the batter.
While your pancakes are cooking, stir together the heavy cream and the maple syrup to make the maple cream syrup. Bonus step is to warm up the syrup in a small pot before adding the cream!

Stir constantly (so they don’t burn) until the peanuts are fragrant, about 10 minutes. Allow the nuts to cool completely. If using pre-roasted nuts, you may skip this step.
Once the peanuts are completely cool, use your hands to loosen the skins from the peanuts. Now, the next part is a little tricky. Grasp the pan with both hands, and toss the peanuts up and down, while angling the pan slightly downward. If all goes right, the peanuts should flip up in the air and land back into the pan while the skins fly out over the sides. It’s a good idea to do this over the sink. Of course, you can also buy shelled, already skinned peanuts. You can also buy plain roasted peanuts of course, but roasting them at home will make the peanut brittle taste a lot fresher.
Next, crush the peanuts into smaller pieces by laying them on a large cutting board or clean kitchen surface and rolling with a rolling pin. Set the peanuts aside. Now brush the surface of your cutting board and rolling pin with a very light layer of oil to prevent sticking when you pour the brittle on it later.
Using the same pan from earlier, melt the rock sugar by stirring constantly over medium low heat. It will take about 5 minutes to melt the rock sugar completely. Add the peanuts and sesame seeds to the melted sugar and mix well.

Roll out the pastry rectangle slightly and split it into two rectangles. Re-wrap and return one of them to the fridge to stay chilled. You will be able to make two batches of palmiers, with different flavors if you like.
Mix together the sugar and salt. Divide the mixture in half (about a ¼ cup each). Spread out 2 tablespoons of the sugar mixture onto a clean work surface and roll out the single puff pastry rectangle into a 12 inch square on top of the sugar.
Spread another 2 tablespoons evenly on top, and lightly roll it into the dough, ensuring both sides are evenly coated. Be sure to gather any loose sugar on the work surface and use it on top of the dough. This should use ¼ cup total sugar.
If using any added ingredients (e.g., dark chocolate, pecans, rosemary/garlic, etc.), sprinkle half over the folded dough. (Note, for the savory mixtures, you are replacing the sugar.)
Fold both sides of the square toward the center so they go halfway to the middle. Fold the folded sides again so the two folds meet exactly at the middle of the dough. If using any added ingredients (e.g., dark chocolate, pecans, rosemary/garlic, etc.), sprinkle more over the folded dough. Fold in half again so you have one long log, and wrap the dough in plastic wrap. Chill for at least 30 minutes in the refrigerator or 15 minutes in the freezer.
Repeat the process using the other half of the dough and flavoring mixture.
When the dough is nearly done chilling, preheat your oven to 425 degrees F/220 degrees C. Using a sharp knife, cut the roll into ½ inch pieces.

Su-Style Red Bean Mooncakes (苏式月饼),Judy,https://thewoksoflife.com/red-bean-mooncakes-su-style/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/red-bean-mooncakes-24.jpg,"['1 recipe sweet red bean paste filling', '3 cups all-purpose flour ((415g))', '2 tablespoons sugar ((20g))', '¾ cup lard ((160g))', '1 cup lukewarm water ((250 ml, about 140 degrees F /60 degrees C))', '2 cups cake flour ((265g))', '⅔ cup lard ((140g))']","Start by making the red bean paste. You can either follow our instant pot red bean paste recipe, or our stovetop version.
Then make the soft dough. In a large mixing bowl, mix together 3 cups of flour and 2 tablespoons sugar. Form a well in the flour, and add ¾ cup of lard. Slowly add 1 cup of lukewarm water in 3-4 batches, mixing with a rubber spatula. Keep folding the lard into the flour with a spatula to form a smooth dough ball. Cover with clear plastic wrap and let it rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.
To make the pastry dough, combine 2 cups of cake flour with ⅔ cup lard. Knead and form the dough ball. Cover with clear plastic wrap, and chill in the fridge for 30 minutes.
To assemble the mooncakes: after both kinds of dough have chilled for 30 minutes, take them out and weigh each ball. Take the total weight of both balls of dough (we’ll be combining them), and divide it by the number of balls of red bean paste filling that you have (you will have made these balls of filling when following the recipe for the filling). This will give you the amount of dough needed for each mooncake. I needed 55 grams of dough to make 1 mooncake.
Now transfer the soft dough onto a clean and lightly-floured flat surface. Divide the soft dough as well as the pastry dough into two equal portions, and do the next step in two batches, especially if you don’t have a large surface.
On a floured surface, press the soft dough into a large disc, and add the pastry dough in the middle. Close all sides to form a large ball. Remember to keep flouring the work surface as needed to prevent it from sticking. With a rolling pin, roll it into a rectangle shape about ¼-inch thick. Then fold the rectangle shape into a tri-fold. Roll it out again into a rectangle shape that’s about ⅛-inch thick. Roll up the sheet on the long-side into a tube and do your best to roll it tight. Now cut the tube into cylinders, each weighing as much as you calculated with the help of a kitchen scale.
Now take one dough segment and stand it upright so that the swirls are facing up, and press it flat. With a rolling pin, roll the dough into a 4-inch disc (it should be slightly thinner around the outer edges and thicker in the middle). Add a ball of sweet red bean paste filling in the center, then close all the sides until it’s sealed tight and no filling is visible. Put the seam side down, gently flattening the ball into a round disc that’s 1-inch thick. Place it on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, seam side down, with at least an inch of space on all sides. Repeat until you’ve made all the mooncakes. At this point, you can also stamp the mooncakes with a design using 10 drops of red food coloring mixed with ⅛ teaspoon water. Simply dip your stamp (or a star anise pod) into the ""ink,"" shake off any excess, and stamp the center of the mooncakes).
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F, with a rack positioned in the middle of the oven. Bake the mooncakes for 15 minutes. Then carefully flip each mooncake, return to the oven, and bake for another 15 minutes.
