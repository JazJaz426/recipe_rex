Shrimp Fried Rice,Bill,https://thewoksoflife.com/shrimp-fried-rice/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/shrimp-fried-rice-2-1.jpg,"['2 cups uncooked jasmine rice', '1½ cups water', '1 tablespoon dark soy sauce', '2 teaspoons light soy sauce', '½ teaspoon turmeric', '3 tablespoons canola oil ((divided))', '2 eggs ((beaten))', '12 ounces shrimp ((340g, 51 to 60 size, peeled and deveined))', '1 medium onion ((diced))', '¼ teaspoon salt ((or to taste))', '¼ teaspoon sugar', '¼ teaspoon sesame oil', '¼ teaspoon ground white pepper', '1 cup snow peas ((chopped))', '1 scallion ((chopped))', '1 tablespoon Shaoxing wine']","First, wash the rice, and pour off the excess water. Combine the drained rice with 1 ½ cups water, the soy sauces and turmeric powder in a thick-bottomed pot or your rice cooker. Cook the rice per our instructions for perfect stovetop rice or press the button on your rice cooker! If you have not purchased a rice cooker yet and consider yourself a rice-lover, consider purchasing one! Check out our Chinese Cooking Tools page for more information and some useful links to products.
When the rice is cooked, fluff it with a fork or rice paddle. You will see that you now have a nice uniform golden brown rice. You can use this rice fresh or refrigerate it, and use it the next day. If you use cold refrigerated rice, you’ll have to break it up with your hands before cooking as well as add a sprinkling of water and cover your fried rice when cooking to heat it through.
Now onto the “fried” portion of this fried rice. Heat your wok over medium high heat. Add 1 tablespoon of oil, and add the eggs, scrambling them until they’re just cooked. Use your spatula to break up the large pieces into smaller chunks. You can start scooping them up when they look like they are almost done, and put them back into the same bowl you mixed them in. Set aside. You will cook them again in the rice.
Heat the wok until just smoking, and spread 1 tablespoon oil around the perimeter of the wok. Spread the shrimp out in a single layer, and let them sear for 20 seconds. Stir fry the shrimp until opaque, transfer them back to their bowl, and set aside. Again, they’ll get cooked again in the rice! For the record, when cooking large volumes of shrimp fried rice in restaurants, shrimp are usually pre-boiled (like they do for shrimp cocktail). Wok cooks then grab handfuls of the precooked shrimp for each order, which makes the process go quickly and smoothly, but at home, searing the shrimp definitely makes for better flavor!
With the wok over medium high heat, add the third tablespoon of oil, and sauté the onions until translucent.
Add the rice, using your metal spatula to flatten and break up any remaining clumps. If the rice is cold from the refrigerator, continue stir-frying until the rice is warmed up, which will take about 5 minutes, or sprinkle a tablespoon or two of water around the rice, lower the heat slightly, and cover for one minute to let the steam do some of the work.
Once the rice is warmed (this is very important or the sauce will not mix as well and the color of the rice will not be as uniform), add the salt, sugar, sesame oil, and freshly ground white pepper, and mix with a scooping motion until the rice is evenly coated with the seasonings. The rice should be hot by this time. Now add the shrimp and snow peas, and stir fry for another 30 seconds.
Add the eggs and scallions and continue stir-frying the rice for another 30 seconds. Gather all of the rice into the middle of the wok to let the sides of the wok heat up. After about 20 seconds, spread the Shaoxing wine around the perimeter of the wok, and stir-fry for another 20 seconds. This step gives that little extra wok hei that you taste when you get fried rice from a good Chinese restaurant!

Salmon Teriyaki Bowls In 30 Minutes,Bill,https://thewoksoflife.com/salmon-teriyaki-bowls/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/salmon-teriyaki-9-1.jpg,"['1 slice fresh ginger ((smashed with a cleaver))', '1/3 cup low sodium soy sauce', '¼ cup mirin', '¼ cup sake or rice wine', '3 tablespoons honey', '1 teaspoon cornstarch ((mixed into a slurry with 1 teaspoon water))', '4 salmon filets ((with skin, 4 to 6 ounces each))', '1/8 teaspoon salt', 'Fresh ground black pepper to taste', '1/8 teaspoon garlic powder', 'Wasabi ((optional))', '1 teaspoon vegetable oil', '6 cups cooked Japanese short grain rice', 'Toasted sesame seeds', 'Roasted seaweed sheets']","Start by combining the ingredients for the teriyaki sauce (except the cornstarch slurry) in a small saucepan and set aside. Next, prepare your salmon. Sometimes, salmon fillets will have scales still on them. I like to use a serrated knife to carefully scrape them off. Then rinse and pat the salmon dry with a paper towel.
Rub the salmon with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. If using wasabi, you can take a small dab of wasabi and rub it onto each piece of salmon now (you can also just serve it on the side later).
Preheat your oven to 400 degrees F. Take the saucepan you prepared earlier and bring the sauce mixture to a simmer. Stir in the cornstarch slurry, and continue to simmer for 5 minutes, or until the sauce is thick enough to coat a spoon. Turn off the heat.
Add a tablespoon of oil to a cast iron skillet or other thick, oven-proof pan, and place over medium heat. Place the salmon in the pan skin-side down, and brush with a small amount of teriyaki sauce. Be careful not to let the sauce drip down the sides to the pan; if it does get to the pan, it will burn and become bitter. Sear the salmon for 3 minutes.
Brush a bit more teriyaki sauce onto the salmon, again being careful to use just enough so that it doesn’t drip down to the pan, and transfer to the preheated oven. After 3 minutes, brush more sauce on the salmon and then again after another 3 minutes.Use a knife to poke the thickest part of the salmon and spread the meat to take a peek inside. Take the salmon out of the oven early if necessary because there is a world of difference between perfectly cooked and overdone salmon!
After a final 2 minutes of baking, remove the salmon from the oven. (The salmon will have been roasting for a total of 8 minutes). Note: If you like your salmon medium rare, you can reduce the cooking time by 2 or 3 minutes.
Serve the salmon over rice and drizzle with more teriyaki sauce. Sprinkle with toasted sesame seeds and roasted seaweed.

One trick for the noodles is to soak the whole bag (unopened) in hot water, which speeds up the warming process without making the noodles soggy.
If you can’t find lo mein noodles, you can actually substitute dried linguini. Just cook until al dente, drain, and immediately toss with 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil, working the oil into the pasta so the noodles don't stick together. Always prepare your noodles just before you are ready to make the dish, so they don’t dry out and remain at room temperature or warmer. This makes the stir-frying process much easier.
Combine the sugar, soy sauces, oyster sauce, sesame oil, and white pepper in a bowl until the sugar is dissolved and set aside. Heat a large wok over high heat until it just starts to smoke, and add 1 tablespoon of oil around the perimeter of the wok. Quickly spread the shrimp around your wok and let them sear for 10-15 seconds on each side. Immediately transfer the shrimp to a plate and set aside.
Return the wok to the highest heat possible and add 2 tablespoons oil, along with the garlic. After a few seconds, add the mushrooms, carrots, bamboo shoots, and water chestnuts and stir-fry for 30 seconds.
Next, spread the Shaoxing wine around the perimeter of the wok, and then add the napa cabbage. Stir-fry for another 30 seconds. Spread the noodles evenly over the vegetables and give everything a good stir for 1 minute.

At this point, the noodles should be softened, so add in the sauce mixture you set aside earlier and mix until everything is well combined.

Rinse it well in cold water. Cut the tentacles off using one cut, keeping about a 1/4 inch of the hood in order to end up with one piece of calamari that includes all the tentacles. If you're using larger squid, you can cut these pieces lengthwise in half in order to make them bite-sized. Having each piece be roughly the same size is important for achieving the same cooking time for each piece of calamari. Drain the squid pieces in a colander and transfer to a bowl.
Marinate the squid in the shaoxing wine and sesame oil. Toss gently and set aside.
In a medium deep pot, add enough oil so that the level of oil reaches 4 inches up the side of the pot. Heat the oil until the temperature reaches 325 degrees.
While you're waiting for the oil to heat, prepare your dry mixture. Combine the all-purpose flour, semolina flour, cornmeal, salt, and white pepper in a medium bowl. Set aside.
When the oil reaches temperature, you're ready to start dredging your squid. Work in batches of small fistfuls of calamari. Gently squeeze off any liquid and dredge the squid in the dry mixture.
Using a long-handled sieve or slotted spoon, lower the calamari into the hot oil. Gently move the calamari pieces back and forth. Let them fry until golden brown, about 2-2 1/2 minutes. Remove all the calamari and let drain on a paper-towel-lined plate. Taste one piece of calamari for saltiness (be careful, it's hot). You can sprinkle more salt immediately after frying to your taste. A necessary step, however, is to crack some fresh white pepper over the freshly fried squid. Continue frying in these small batches and seasoning with white pepper until you've fried all the squid.
Now the next phase: stir-frying the fried squid. Heat a wok over medium-high heat. Add a tablespoon of vegetable oil. Add the ginger and let it fry in the oil. After about 20 seconds, add the garlic. Stir the garlic around the wok quickly in order to prevent burning. When the garlic gets lightly golden in color, add the peppers. Continue to stir fry for another 30 seconds.

They should be as fresh as possible! After the crabs are prepared, pat them dry and dredge them with flour. Set aside.
In most restaurants, crabs are almost always deep fried first, so they are cooked quickly and the juices get sealed in. But since we're doing this at home, we don't have to get out the deep fryer. The way to do it is to sear the crabs on all sides to get the same effect. Heat the wok over high heat and add 3 tablespoons of oil. Sear the crabs, paying special attention to the open dredged areas in order to seal in the juices. Turn the heat to medium and fry until they've turned red-orange. This process should take about 5 minutes and the crab should be about 80% done. Set them aside.
There should be a tablespoon or more oil left in the wok and if not, add more until you have at least 1 ½ tablespoons. Add the ginger. Caramelize for 1-2 minutes on low heat, and then add the garlic, shallots, and the white portions of the scallion. Cook until softened.

The goal is to get pieces of fish with a lot of surface area, as they’ll shrink once cooked.
Next, marinate the fish. Add 3/4 teaspoon salt, ¼ teaspoon ground white pepper, and 1 tablespoon Shaoxing wine. Mix (best with your hand) everything well. Next, add the egg white and mix, followed by 1½ tablespoons cornstarch. Mix until the marinade starts to feel “slimy,” for lack of a better term. Finally, drizzle 1 tablespoon of oil over the top--there’s no need to mix it in, just drizzle it over the surface. Put the fish in the refrigerator, and marinate for about 20 minutes.
The active cooking time takes less than 10 minutes, so make sure the rest of the ingredients are prepped while the fish is marinating, and that you’re ready to eat right afterwards, because this dish is best served immediately.
In a wok set over high heat, add the chicken stock, water, ginger, garlic, scallions, ¼ teaspoon of white pepper, and 1 tablespoon of Shaoxing wine. Bring it to a boil. Now is a good time to add salt to taste. Next, add the bean sprouts, and bring to a boil once more. Cook for one minute. Now turn down the heat. Using a fine-meshed strainer, spider, or large slotted spoon, scoop all of the solids out of the soup and transfer to a heat proof serving bowl. It’s very important that your serving vessel be heat-proof, as you’ll be pouring very hot oil into it later.
Now, in a small pot, slowly heat up ½ - ¾ cup oil. It doesn’t have to be exact, but you should use at least a ½ cup. To test whether the oil is heated to the correct temperature, dip a wooden/bamboo chopstick into the oil and look for small bubbles forming around it, but no smoke.

The best way to do this is to follow the directions on your rice cooker and use a little bit less water so the rice comes out just slightly drier than usual. Let the rice cool uncovered and use a fork to break it up and fluff it. You can also refrigerate it the night before and when you're ready to use it the next day, rinse your hands in water and carefully break up the clumps of rice. The water should prevent or minimize the rice sticking to your hands.
Heat your wok until it just begins to smoke and add 1 tablespoon oil. Throw in the scallops and sear (without moving them) 60 seconds until they get some good color. Toss them around until they're just opaque and set aside on a plate. Beat the eggs with shaoxing wine and salt and set aside.
Wash and dry your wok and heat it over low heat, with 2 tablespoons oil. Add the garlic and spread it around evenly. Let the garlic fry very slowly until they just turn golden. If it goes brown, it's already burned and bitter, so keep a constant watch on it! It should take about 5 minutes for the garlic to get crispy and just start to turn light golden. When they are ready, transfer the crispy garlic to a paper towel to drain and set aside.
Leave the infused oil from the garlic in the wok, and raise the heat to medium high. Add the diced onions and stir-fry until translucent. Add in the rice to the onion mixture, and then pour the egg mixture evenly over all the rice. Immediately begin stirring constantly in a scoop and lift motion. This will leave all your rice coated in a thin layer of scrambled egg. After about 90 seconds of stirring, mix in the XO sauce. Season with salt and pepper to taste, and then add in the scallops and scallion.

For this dish, we used scallops, shrimp, and prepared frozen squid that was already cleaned and cut. You can also prepare fresh squid. Do this by cutting the cleaned squid open lengthwise and lightly scoring it with a diamond pattern. See the technique we used in our Stir Fried Squid with Pickled Vegetables.
Prepare the sauce by mixing together your hot chicken stock with the sesame oil, salt, sugar, oyster sauce, white pepper. Set aside. Separately, mix the cornstarch and water into a slurry and set aside.
Cut the ends of your choy sum, wash it them well in cold water, and set aside. These will be left whole as they are served in Chinese restaurants.
Pan-fry the noodles
Bring a large pot or wok filled with water to a boil. If using fresh noodles, blanch them for 30-60 seconds. If using dried noodles, follow the package directions for cooking times, but make sure they remain al dente. In both cases, place the noodles directly into a cold water bath to stop the cooking and drain thoroughly in a colander.
Next, heat your wok or nonstick frying pan until hot. Add a tablespoon of oil and swirl it around so it coats your cooking surface. Spread out the noodles in a thin, even layer, and fry for 3 to 5 minutes or until crispy.
Use a spatula to loosen the noodles. Take a peek under the noodles to ensure they’re golden brown. Use a spatula to flip the noodles over. If you can’t get it in one shot, flip it over in sections.
Add another tablespoon of vegetable oil around the sides of the pan, and crisp the other side to get the noodles evenly browned. Transfer the noodles to a serving plate.
Pre-cook seafood and choy sum
Bring 6 cups of water to a boil in your wok (you can also use the water you boiled the noodles in), and add a tablespoon of oil to the water. Blanch the choy sum for 30 seconds. Remove with a Chinese spider or strainer shaking off the excess water and place around the noodles.
Next, blanch the shrimp, scallops, and squid by slowly stirring them in the water until just opaque (about 20 seconds). Transfer to a plate. The seafood should be just 70% cooked, since they will be cooked again in the stir-fry step of the dish.
Assemble the dish
Start with a clean, dry wok over medium low heat. Spread 1 tablespoon of oil around the perimeter of your wok. Add the ginger and cook for 10 to 20 seconds.
Stir in the garlic, scallions, carrots and mushrooms, turning the heat up to the highest setting. Next, add the shrimp, scallops, and squid. Stir-fry for 10 seconds, and add the wine.
Next, add the sauce mixture, and bring to a simmer. Stir the cornstarch slurry to ensure it’s combined, and add ⅔ of it while stirring the contents of the wok. Cook for 15 seconds. The sauce should be thick enough to coat a spoon. Add the rest of the cornstarch slurry until the sauce is your preferred consistency.

Chinese Deep Fried Oysters,Bill,https://thewoksoflife.com/chinese-deep-fried-oysters/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/fried-oysters-2.jpg,"['1 pound shucked oysters ((450g))', '¾ cup all-purpose flour for the batter ((plus ⅓ cup for dredging the oysters))', '½ teaspoon baking powder', '⅛ teaspoon ground white pepper', '⅛ teaspoon garlic powder', '⅛ teaspoon onion powder', '½ teaspoon salt', '3-4 cups canola oil ((for frying))', '⅔ cup ice cold seltzer water', '½ teaspoon sesame oil', 'Iceberg lettuce ((shredded))', '1 scallion ((chopped, for garnish))', '1 tablespoon ketchup', '1 teaspoon soy sauce', '2 tablespoons rice vinegar', '¼ teaspoon salt', '2 tablespoons sugar', '1 teaspoon cornstarch ((mixed with ⅓ cup water))']","Drain the shucked oysters from the plastic container, and give them a gentle rinse with cold water. The oysters are very delicate, so be careful handling them. Place the oysters in a colander, and let the excess water drain for at least 10 minutes.
Prepare the batter by mixing ¾ cup flour, the baking powder, white pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and salt until well-combined.
Heat the oil to 350 degrees F in a small (to save oil) but deep pot (to prevent splattering). Check the oil temperature with a candy or oil thermometer for accuracy.
Right before you’re ready to fry the oysters, add the cold seltzer––it makes for a crispier oyster. Mix until your batter is smooth (a few small lumps here and there is fine). Then, mix in the sesame oil.
After the oysters have drained, lightly pat each of them dry with a paper towel, and dredge each oyster lightly with flour. I know it’s tempting to dredge all of the oysters at once in a glob, but it’s best to dredge each oyster individually just before you batter and fry them to ensure they are fully and evenly coated.
After dredging, dip each oyster into the batter so it is fully coated. Lift them out of the batter carefully--you can use the edge of the bowl to scrape off excess batter if needed.
Now you’re ready to deep fry the oysters. Check the temperature of the oil again with your thermometer. As you are frying, you should adjust the heat to maintain a temperature between 325 degrees F and 350 degrees F, because the oil will cool quickly as you drop in the battered oysters and then quickly heat again as they cook.
Lower the oyster halfway into the oil and slowly swirl it for 2 or 3 seconds so the batter cooks slightly, and then drop it into the oil. This process prevents the oyster from sticking to the bottom of the pot. Fry the oysters in batches, depending upon the size of your pot and the amount of oil you are using. For this recipe, we fried oysters in batches of 3 or 4 depending upon their size.
Use a slotted spoon to lift the oysters out when they are golden brown and transfer them to a metal cooling rack to drain. Repeat until all the oysters have been fried.
Now you can make the dipping sauce. In a small saucepan, add the ketchup, soy sauce, rice vinegar, salt, sugar, and cornstarch slurry and heat to a simmer. You can adjust the flavor by either adding vinegar to make it more tart, adding sugar if you like it sweeter, or adding more cornstarch and water if you like it thicker.
It’s best to serve these immediately, but if you are like us on Chinese New Year, you are preparing many dishes at the same time, and it’s inevitable that these won’t get eaten immediately! So just before serving, you can reheat your oil to 375 degrees F, and drop the oysters in 3 or 4 at a time, frying them for 30 seconds or until they are crisp again. Alternatively, you can heat them in a toaster oven at 400 degrees F for 5 minutes.
Serve these deep fried oysters on a bed of iceberg lettuce, and garnish with chopped scallions. The dipping sauce should be served warm, so reheat your dipping sauce if needed.",en-US,"{'calories': '145 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '17 g', 'proteinContent': '2 g', 'fatContent': '8 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '1 g', 'cholesterolContent': '2 mg', 'sodiumContent': '294 mg', 'fiberContent': '1 g', 'sugarContent': '4 g', 'servingSize': '1 serving'}",5.0,,The Woks of Life,45,8 serving(s)

Let it sit for 15-20 minutes at room temperature.
Prepare the rest of the ingredients. Slice up the onions and set aside. Chop the shallots and garlic for the edamame.
Heat a couple tablespoons olive oil in a pan over medium heat for the edamame. Add the shallots and garlic and cook for 2-3 minutes until fragrant. Add the edamame and sautee until they’re really tender and slightly browned, about 8-10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
Heat another cast iron or nonstick skillet over medium heat. Once it’s good and hot, add a couple tablespoons of olive oil. Season one side of the salmon with some freshly ground black pepper. Carefully place the salmon in the olive oil, pepper side down. Season the other side with pepper.
Sear for about 4-5 minutes on the first side until they’ve got good color. Flip them over and cook for another 2-3 minutes on the other side, depending on the thickness of the salmon.
Take the salmon fillets out of the pan and let them rest on a plate while you assemble the rest of the dish. Add the sliced onion to the pan you were cooking the salmon in, and sautee for a few minutes until golden and caramelized.
Meanwhile, transfer the edamame to a food processor. Add 1/2 cup fresh cilantro and the zest and juice of one lemon. Puree, gradually adding ¼ cup olive oil as the food processor runs. Then stream in some water gradually until it reaches a creamy consistency. A ½ cup to 2/3 of a cup should do it, but see what works for you.

Gently mix the fish and all of the marinade ingredients, spreading them out to a single layer on a baking sheet, uncovered. Let the fish marinate in the refrigerator for 4-6 hours. Overnight is best. The fish will dry out slightly, which is perfect for frying later.
For the sauce, add the water, ginger, star anise, cinnamon and bay leaves to a small pot, and bring it to a boil. Turn the heat down to low, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, remove the star anise and cinnamon. Add the brown rock sugar, Shaoxing wine, oyster sauce, light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, Chinese black vinegar, scallions, and orange juice. Simmer slowly over medium low heat until the sauce reduces to about 2 cups (about 20-30 minutes). If necessary, remove the lid towards the end to achieve a slightly thicker sauce, but do keep an eye on it to avoid over-reducing the sauce. Once it’s done, scoop out all the solid spices with a slotted spoon, and let the sauce cool completely. Then it’s ready to use.
Now, to fry the fish. Add 2-3 inches of canola or vegetable oil in a deep, small pot (to avoid using too much oil). Heat the oil to 375 degrees F, and fry the fish in batches of three to four pieces until they turn golden brown. Do not stir the fish around until there is a golden crust, or the delicate fish might fall part in the cooking oil. It’s also best to fry the fish once to get a golden brown color, and then fry the fish again until it’s a dark golden brown. There is no need to worry about over-frying the fish.
Next, put the sizzling fried fish directly into the prepared sauce. Ensure all of the pieces are totally coated. The golden brown crust on the fish will soak up the sauce and flavor the fish.

We used instant dashi, but if you want to make it yourself, we have detailed instructions in our Miso Soup recipe. At this point, you can also cook the rice you’ll serve with the tempura.
Next, prepare the vegetables, making sure everything is washed and trimmed. Nothing should be too wet ahead of frying, so if needed, pat the vegetables with a kitchen towel or let them sit at room temperature to dry off while you prep everything else.
Score the shrimp with a sharp knife so that they can lay flat (you can do this lightly if you don’t mind them retaining some of their curved shape). Refrigerate the shrimp until you’re ready to fry.
Next, make the batter. Stir together the ice water, cake flour, and egg yolks. No need to get rid of all the lumps—in fact, take care not to overmix it. Pop it in the refrigerator while you heat the frying oil.
In a small deep pot, heat enough oil to fill it about halfway, over medium-high heat. While that’s happening, set up a wire rack over a sheet pan or a platter lined with paper towels. When a drop of the batter sizzles vigorously but doesn’t brown too quickly, you’re ready to go.
To fry, swirl one piece of vegetable or shrimp in the batter (for the shrimp, hold it by the tail), and lower it gently into the batter. Fry everything in batches of 3-4 items for 45-90 seconds, turning each item 3-4 times. When the vegetables are lightly golden and the shrimp are lightly golden, orange, and floating, it’s ready to be transferred to the wire rack.

Pan Fried Fish: Chinese Whole Fish Recipe,Bill,https://thewoksoflife.com/pan-fried-fish/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/pan-fried-fish-2-1.jpg,"['2 porgies ((about 1 to 1½ pounds each; 450g-650g))', '1/4 teaspoon salt', '3 tablespoons vegetable oil', '5 slices ginger ((1/8-inch thick))', '1 teaspoon sugar', '2 tablespoons hot water', '2 tablespoons soy sauce', 'Pinch fresh ground white pepper', '¼ teaspoon sesame oil ((optional))', '2 tablespoons Shaoxing wine', '2 scallions ((chopped))']","Clean the fish, removing all scales, making sure to pay attention to scales on the belly, the head, and near the fins. Even if you have it cleaned at your fish market, fish mongers always tend to miss some scales. Make sure you clean out the inside of the fish as well.
Let the fish drain in a colander and pat both sides dry with a paper towel. Transfer to a plate. Sprinkle salt on both sides of both fish--use about 1/4 teaspoon in total. Set aside for 15 minutes.
Heat your wok over medium-high heat, and spread 3 tablespoons of oil around the perimeter. Add the ginger. After about 10 seconds, turn the ginger over for another 10 seconds and push them to the side. The wok should be hot but not smoking too much (an indication that the wok is too hot). The ginger should be slightly caramelized but not burned.
Use a paper towel to pat the fish dry again, and carefully place into the wok in one motion. Do not move the fish! After about 1 minute, turn the heat down to medium; you want to get a nice light crust on the skin without it burning. Tilt the wok carefully one side at a time so the oil distributes around the perimeter of the fish, including the head and the tail. You can add more oil around the perimeter of the wok if you want some extra insurance against sticking.
Continue frying the fish for 5 to 6 minutes on the first side. At this point, a light crust should have formed, and you can give the wok a little shake now--the fish should slide around easily. If not, you can use a metal spatula to lift the fish slightly and peek underneath to check the color and to make sure the fish is not sticking. The fish should be a nice golden brown.
If the fish still sticks, then you probably have the heat too low, so turn it up slightly, add a little more oil, and let it cook for another 1 to 2 minutes! Once you have the fish sliding around in the wok or pan and the first side is golden brown, then you are ready for the flip! Carefully slide the spatula under the middle of the fish on the side towards the middle of the wok and in one steady motion, lift and flip it towards the outside of the wok. Repeat the same “flip” for the other fish.
Let the fish fry on the second side for another 4 minutes and again, add some oil if you think it is necessary. While the fish is frying, dissolve the sugar and hot water in a small bowl, and add the soy sauce, white pepper, and sesame oil (if using). Set aside.
Shake the wok to make sure the fish is not stuck. Next, add the Shaoxing wine around the perimeter of the wok and let cook off for 30 seconds. Pour the soy sauce mixture around the perimeter of the wok and turn the heat back up until the sauce is simmering (about 30 seconds). Add in the chopped scallions.
Turn off the heat, and use your spatula to carefully transfer the fish to serving plates. Scoop up the rest of the remaining sauce, pour evenly over the fish and serve!",en-US,"{'calories': '300 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '2 g', 'proteinContent': '41 g', 'fatContent': '13 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '7 g', 'cholesterolContent': '110 mg', 'sodiumContent': '522 mg', 'fiberContent': '1 g', 'sugarContent': '1 g', 'servingSize': '1 serving'}",5.0,,The Woks of Life,45,6 serving(s)
Cantonese-Style Ginger Scallion Lobster,Bill,https://thewoksoflife.com/ginger-scallion-lobster-cantonese/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/ginger-scallion-lobster-14-1.jpg,"['2 live lobsters ((1 ¼ to 1 ½ pounds each))', '2 tablespoons all purpose flour', '1 tablespoon cornstarch', '2 cups oil ((for flash deep frying; plus 2 tablespoons))', '6 slices ginger', '3 scallions ((cut into 2-inch pieces))', '2 tablespoons shaoxing wine', '1 tablespoon soy sauce', '1/4 teaspoon sesame oil', '1/8 teaspoon sugar', '1/8 teaspoon ground white pepper']","Remove the head shell to dispatch the lobster. You can discard these, or trim them so that they can sit upright on the plate (if you want to keep them for presentation, which is what's done in most restaurants).
Cut off the mouth portion of the lobster head with a cleaver or chef's knife. Cut or twist off the lobster claws, and cut off the smaller legs. Set those aside.
Remove and discard the lobster gills, which are inedible. Remove the green mustard, innards and the sand tract. Rinse all the lobster pieces under cold running water. You can discard the mustard, use it in another dish, or include it in this dish. We left it out (some people don't like the strong flavor).
Split the lobster lengthwise from the head portion to the end of the tail, so you have two halves. Take each half and cut off the upper section, separating it from the tail portion (there's actually quite a bit of meat in that piece). Cut each tail half into 3 equal pieces, giving you 6 total tail meat pieces. You can adjust this according to the size of the lobster.
Separate the elbow joint from the claws and split each claw with a cleaver (using a mallet may help).
Let all of the lobster pieces drain of excess water after you rinse them and pat dry with a paper towel.
Mix the flour and cornstarch in a shallow bowl, and lightly dredge the lobster pieces. Dredge only the exposed meat to seal in the juices.
At this point, many restaurants deep fry the lobster in a large wok to quickly seal in the juices. This process only takes 20 seconds or so, but for home cooking, we'll use a smaller pot and fry in batches. This flash fry method cooks the lobster about 70% of the way through, enhances the lobster flavor, produces a rich color, and seals in the juices while preventing the tender meat from overcooking.
Heat 2 cups of oil in a small pot to about 350 degrees F, and drop the lobster into the pot a couple pieces at a time for about 10 seconds. Remove to a sheet pan to drain. The shells should turn bright red almost instantly.
To finish the dish, start with a clean wok over high heat. Add 2 tablespoons oil to the wok, along with the ginger. Let the ginger fry for about 30 seconds, until fragrant.
Add the white portions of the scallions and the lobster. Stir fry on for 20 seconds, keeping the heat cranked up as high as it'll go.
Pour the wine around the perimeter of the wok and immediately cover it. Let it cook for about 2 minutes. This step infuses or ""bakes"" the lobster with the ginger and scallion flavor.
Uncover the wok and add the soy sauce, sesame oil, sugar, white pepper, and the rest of the scallions. Stir fry for another minute. You can add a couple tablespoons of water if the wok is too dry.

This process entails chopping and folding the shrimp paste over and onto itself, and continuing to chop. Transfer the shrimp paste to a bowl.
Chop the scallions. Set aside half of the green portion for the sauce. Add the rest of the chopped scallion to the shrimp, along with 1 teaspoon salt, 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil, 1 1/2 tablespoons cornstarch, 2 teaspoons Shaoxing wine, and white pepper to taste. Use a fork to beat/whip the shrimp until it is smooth and all the ingredients are well-combined.
Pop the stems off the bell peppers and follow the lines of each pepper to cut into 3-5 segments. Remove the seeds. If using long hot green peppers, just cut them in half lengthwise and remove the seeds.
Stuff each pepper segment with the shrimp mixture until the filling is even with the edges of the peppers. You can also trim the ends of the peppers to ensure they are flush and at the same level of the filling. This will make the peppers easier to cook.
Heat a tablespoon of oil in a wok or skillet over medium high heat and place the peppers in the oil, stuffing side down. Cook until they are browned, about 2 minutes. Turn the peppers over to sear the bottoms for another 2 minutes, turning the heat down if they start to get too dark. If using the long hot green peppers or another variety of thin-fleshed pepper, simply transfer them to the serving plate.
If using bell peppers, which have thicker flesh and take longer to cook, add 2 tablespoons of water to the pan, cover, and steam for another 2 minutes, or until the peppers are just tender. Set aside on a serving plate.
It's time to make the sauce, which only takes a couple minutes. Heat the wok over medium heat and add the oil, garlic and fermented black beans. Stir-fry for a few seconds and add the shaoxing wine. When the wine is bubbly, add the rest of the sauce ingredients (except the cornstarch slurry) and bring to a simmer. Once simmering, add the cornstarch slurry gradually until the sauce is thick enough to coat a spoon.

When it's time to cook, bring 2 to 3 quarts of water to a rolling boil in a large covered stock pot (it should be about 3 inches of water). Rinse the lobsters thoroughly, and remove the rubber bands around the claws.
Place both lobsters in the pot, with tails curled, belly side down. The lobsters should be sitting upright in the pot when you place them, and they should not be fully submerged in water. The lobsters should be placed quickly in the pot, which should then be covered immediately. After 11 minutes, carefully remove the cover and verify that the lobsters are bright red. There should not be any dark spots on the shells; if there are, that means the lobsters aren’t yet cooked through.
Remove the lobsters from the pot with a pair for tongs, and place them into your sink. Give them a good rinse with water to help them cool down and to stop the cooking process.
Prepare a large bowl of water, which you’ll need to rinse the lobster after you extract the meat. Next, transfer the lobsters one at a time to the cutting board. Extract the meat from the lobster tail and claws (see post for more detailed instructions). Chop it up into large chunks.
Now you are ready to put together the lobster roll.
Start by heating three tablespoons of oil in a small pot using low heat. You can test the temperature by adding in a sliver of ginger, which should sizzle and bubble. Add 1 tablespoon of the finely julienned ginger and let fry slowly until golden brown, which should take about 2 to 3 minutes. Use a slotted spoon or strainer and transfer the crispy ginger to a plate lined with paper towels.
Fry 1/3 of the julienned scallion in the same way, and transfer the scallion crisps to a plate. Watch the heat closely, and turn the heat down during frying if needed so you don’t burn them.
Pour off the excess oil, leaving about 1 tablespoon in the pot, and add the remaining ginger and scallion. Stir for about 30 seconds until sizzling, and add 1 tablespoon butter and soy sauce. Once the butter is melted, remove from the heat.
Once the scallion ginger mixture is cooled completely, transfer to a bowl with the mayonnaise, rice vinegar, and half of the chives. Mix until everything is thoroughly combined. Fold in your lobster meat until everything is well coated. Add salt and pepper to taste and set aside.
Brush the brioche rolls with your last tablespoon of butter and lightly toast them in a skillet or cast iron pan. Split them open on a plate, and fill each one full of your Asian lobster salad.

Remove any scales from your fish using a serrated steak knife. The areas to look for are the belly and the edges of the fish including the top, near the dorsal fins, and the head. There is nothing worse than having to pick out scales while you’re having dinner.
Cut off any fins with kitchen shears. They are pretty tough, so be careful with this step. Leave the tail and head in tact for presentation.
Look at the cavity, and you should see the backbone. You may also see a membrane that you should pierce and cut, revealing a blood line near the bone. Run your finger or a spoon across it to clean it thoroughly.
Check the head and gills. You should not see any gills left, and if there are, remove them with the kitchen shears and rinse the area clean. Older Chinese folks who like dining on the fish head will appreciate this step.
Give the fish a final rinse, shake off the excess water (no need to pat it dry) and transfer to a heat-proof plate for steaming. No salt, seasoning, or wine should be used on the fish before steaming. Repeat. Nothing on the fresh fish before steaming!
Assembling the dish:
For steaming, I used an elongated heat-proof plate. To accommodate that, I needed to MacGyver a steaming apparatus that would fit said plate. It's simple enough. I used a wok and metal steam rack. If you need more height to keep the plate above the water in the wok, set a rack on top of a metal can with both ends removed. It’s a handy and cheap addition to your kitchen arsenal!
Steam for 9 minutes and turn off the heat. Use a butter knife to peek at the meat and confirm the fish is cooked through. The meat should be opaque down to the bone, but the bone should be slightly translucent and not fully cooked (remember, you will not be eating the bone. Trust me on this one!).
Next, carefully pour off all of the liquid accumulated on the plate from steaming and spread half of the ginger, the green portions of the scallion, and the cilantro over the fish.
Heat 2 tablespoons oil and the other half of the ginger in a saucepan until the ginger begins to sizzle. Next, add the water, salt, sugar, soy sauce, and fresh ground white pepper and heat the mixture until simmering.
Once simmering, add the rest of the oil and white portions of the scallion and stir until the liquid begins to simmer and sizzle once again. Spoon the entire mixture evenly over the fish and serve hot!",en-US,"{'calories': '307 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '3 g', 'proteinContent': '32 g', 'fatContent': '18 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '2 g', 'cholesterolContent': '136 mg', 'sodiumContent': '1075 mg', 'fiberContent': '1 g', 'sugarContent': '1 g', 'servingSize': '1 serving'}",4.92,,The Woks of Life,35,4 serving(s)

Next, heat a pan with 1 tablespoon of oil over medium-high heat. Stir-fry the carrots for about 1 minute, sprinkling with a pinch of salt. Transfer to a bowl and set aside.
Next, stir fry the bean sprouts using the same method as with the carrots.
Next prep your watercress. Cut each bunch in half and wash thoroughly.
In the same pan you used for the carrots, heat 2 tablespoons of oil over medium high heat. Add the garlic and let fry gently for about 15-20 seconds. Add the watercress, followed by a ½ teaspoon of salt, and stir-fry until completely wilted. Remove from the heat and toss with the soy sauce, sesame seeds, and sesame oil. Set aside.
Now for the salmon. Sprinkle with salt and pepper on both sides. Heat a pan over medium high heat with 3 tablespoons of oil. Add the salmon. Let brown for about 5 minutes. Flip, and let the other side cook for another 5 minutes. Our salmon steak was pretty thick, so cooking time may need to be adjusted depending on how big your piece of salmon is. When in doubt, just use a knife to gently cut into the center to check for doneness. Looks don't matter with this dish, as we'll be flaking the salmon anyway.
While the salmon is cooking, set aside the kimchi and seaweed flakes, cutting up the seaweed with kitchen shears if you're using roasted sheets. Also, cook one egg for each person you're serving.
When the salmon is finished cooking, you're ready to assemble your bibimbap.
Spoon a nice bed of rice into a bowl and top with a small handful of flaked salmon and your egg. Add as much watercress, carrot, bean sprouts, kimchi, and seaweed as your heart desires.

Ketchup Shrimp Stir-Fry: Bill's Mom’s Recipe,Bill,https://thewoksoflife.com/ketchup-shrimp/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/ketchup-shrimp-4.jpg,"['12 ounces large, shell-on headless shrimp ((340g, 15 to 20 size))', '2 tablespoons vegetable or canola oil ((divided))', '7 slices fresh ginger', '1 clove garlic ((sliced))', '2 scallions', '¼ cup ketchup', '1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce ((optional))', '⅛ teaspoon white pepper', '½ teaspoon sugar', '2 tablespoons Shaoxing wine', '1 tablespoon soy sauce']","Rinse your shrimp under running water, and thaw if frozen. Pat dry with a paper towel. If desired, you can peel the shells off for easy eating, but do leave the tails on, as they add extra flavor when seared in the wok. (Note: We cooked and photographed this ketchup shrimp with the shells on like my mom used to do, but I have to admit, this dish may be better if the shrimp are peeled with only the tails left on.)
Heat 1 tablespoon of canola or vegetable oil in your wok until it just starts to smoke. Fry the shrimp on both sides for 20 seconds on each side (15 seconds if you peeled the shells off), and set aside. The shrimp should be 80% cooked.
Turn the heat down to low, and add another tablespoon of oil to your wok. Add the 7 slices of ginger, and let it infuse the oil for 15 seconds. Add sliced garlic and the white parts of the scallions. Turn the heat up to medium high and stir-fry everything for 10 seconds.
Add ¼ cup ketchup and 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce if using. Stir into the oil and fry for 15 seconds. Next, stir in the shrimp and any juices on the plate, and add ⅛ teaspoon white pepper, ½ teaspoon sugar, and 2 tablespoons Shaoxing wine.
Stir for 10 seconds, and add 1 tablespoon soy sauce. Continue to stir-fry until the sauce begins the reduce and coats the shrimp. Finally, add the rest of the scallions (the green parts).
Stir for another 10 seconds and transfer to a dish. Serve this ketchup shrimp dish with white rice and a side of veggies.

Steamed Tilapia: Hunan-Style Whole Fish,Bill,https://thewoksoflife.com/steamed-tilapia-hunan-whole-fish/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/steamed-tilapia-hunan-style-16.jpg,"['1 fresh tilapia ((whole, 1¼ - 1½ pounds or about 650g, best from a live tank))', '16 ounces silken tofu', '⅛ teaspoon salt ((for the tofu, plus more to taste))', '3 tablespoons canola oil', '1½ tablespoons ginger', '6 tablespoons Duo Jiao', '3 cloves garlic ((minced))', '1 scallion', '⅔ cup hot water', '2 tablespoons soy sauce', '1 teaspoon sugar', '¼ teaspoon white pepper']","The fish market should have gutted the fish, trimmed off the sharp fins, and removed the scales, but there’s additional work needed to prepare your whole fish! First, use a knife to go over the fish and remove any scales that the market may have missed. Usually scales are missed along the fins, under the belly, and around the head.
You should also check the inside cavity of the fish and use a dull butter knife to remove/scrape any blood lines or membranes that were left behind. Sometimes there are also gills remaining and sharp fins, so use kitchen shears to help with cutting these sections off. Fish markets generally don’t bother with these cleaning and preparation details, but they make all the difference!
Next, start from the tail end of the fish, and cut it like you are filleting it from the tail to the front. When you reach the bones in the cavity, you can cut through them with a sturdy chef’s knife but be careful not to cut yourself! Kitchen shears could be helpful for the novice cook.
After cutting through the bones, continue splitting the fish up to the top fin as if you were filleting it, but *stop* short of cutting off the filet from the rest of the fish. Once you reach the head, split it in half, and now you have a split fish.
Give your fish a quick rinse, set it aside on a cutting board skin side up, and press on the fish slightly to flatten it out.
Prepare your silken tofu by cutting the plastic cover off, and pouring out any liquid. Next, turn the tofu container upside down on a cutting board, and carefully lift the container away from the block of tofu. Next, cut the tofu in half lengthwise, and slice it crosswise into ½-inch slices.
Use your knife or cleaver to lift each half of the cut tofu on a large heatproof plate or large bowl. The platter should be slightly deep enough to hold the steaming liquid and sauce. Lay your tofu bed down on the plate so the pieces are fanned across either side. Sprinkle ⅛ teaspoon of salt evenly over the silken tofu. Next, gently place the fish skin side-up on the tofu, and it’s ready for the steamer!
Use 4 cups of cold water in the wok, place your fish fish on a steaming rack inside, and cover the wok.
Turn the heat to medium-high. The water should boil in about 7 minutes. Steam for another 6 minutes––a total of 13 minutes. Check that the water is simmering after 7 minutes. If not, then the heat must be turned up. If you see the water boiling vigorously, then turn the heat down to a simmer/very low boil. After a total of 13 minutes, check the fish for doneness. It’s key not to overcook the fish for the best results!
Use a butter knife to press into the part of the fish that has bones underneath it. The knife should easily go through the meat like butter, right to the bone. If the meat feels a little tough or you encounter some resistance as you penetrate the fish (or you don’t hit the bone), then the meat is likely still raw and will need another few minutes.
Once your tilapia passes the doneness test, turn the heat off and carefully pour off the liquid that has pooled at the bottom of the plate, using a dry kitchen towel to grip the plate on one side, and if you need it, a spatula to gently hold the fish in place. You can do this directly in the wok, or if it’s too hot, pour it off into the kitchen sink. Either way, do it slowly and take care not to let the fish and tofu slide off the plate!
In a clean pan or wok set over low heat, add 3 tablespoons of canola oil, 1½ tablespoons minced ginger, and 6 tablespoons of duo jiao salted chilli peppers. Let the ginger and duo jiao peppers infuse the oil for about 1-2 minutes. The oil should start turning red and fragrant like chili oil!
Next, add 2 teaspoons minced garlic and the white portions of the scallion. Give it a stir for another 10 seconds, and add ⅔ cup hot water, 2 tablespoons soy sauce, and 1 teaspoon granulated white sugar, and ¼ teaspoon ground white pepper powder.
Let the liquid come to a boil, and turn it down to simmer. Season to taste with more salt––or the salty liquid from the duo jiao chili pepper jar. The sauce should be quite salty for this fish dish!
Stir in the green portion of the scallion, and take the pan off the heat. Immediately spoon the sauce onto the fish, making sure to evenly distribute the salted chili peppers, garlic, ginger, and scallions over the fish and tofu.
Sprinkle some additional ground white pepper powder over the top, and your Hunan steamed fish is ready!
Serve your Hunan Steamed Tilapia with plenty of rice, because a spoonful of fish + a big spoonful of this spectacular sauce over rice makes for the perfect bite! It’s also best served family style, perhaps with a stir-fried vegetable or an additional meat dish to give the meal some variety.",en-US,"{'calories': '304 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '11 g', 'proteinContent': '30 g', 'fatContent': '16 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '2 g', 'cholesterolContent': '57 mg', 'sodiumContent': '944 mg', 'fiberContent': '2 g', 'sugarContent': '5 g', 'servingSize': '1 serving'}",5.0,,The Woks of Life,60,4 serving(s)
"A Cheung Fun Recipe (Homemade Rice Noodles), Two Ways",Bill,https://thewoksoflife.com/cheung-fun-homemade-rice-noodles/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/homemade-cheung-fun-12-1.jpg,"['1 1/2 cups rice flour', '3 tablespoons tapioca starch', '2 tablespoons wheat starch', '1/2 teaspoon salt', '2 tablespoons canola oil ((plus more for greasing the pan))', '1 1/2 cups lukewarm water', '1 cup boiling water', '2 teaspoons light brown sugar ((or raw sugar))', '½ cup water', '2 tablespoons dark soy sauce', '2 tablespoons oyster sauce', '1/2 batch cheung fun batter', '¼ cup dried shrimp ((optional))', '1 tablespoon oil', '¼ teaspoon salt', '¼ cup chopped scallions', 'toasted sesame seeds', '1 batch cheung fun batter', '1 package Chinese crullers']","TO MAKE THE RICE NOODLES:
Combine the rice flour, tapioca starch, wheat starch, and salt in a mixing bowl. Add the canola oil and 1 1/2 cups lukewarm water and whisk until smooth. Whisk in the boiling water. Set aside and allow the batter to rest for 45 minutes.
We used an aluminum 10” square cake pan for steaming the rice noodles. You can also use a 9-inch round cake pan and simply adjust the amount of batter per batch. The noodles should be about 1/8” thick, so the batter should just cover the bottom of the pan in an even layer. This homemade noodle may come out a little thicker than what you get with dim sum in restaurants, but you can practice making them thinner!
Use a wok or a deep skillet for the steaming, but whatever you use, it must have a lid. Fill your chosen vessel with at least 2 inches of water. The cake pan with the batter in it should be able to float on the surface of the water, and then the entire cooking vessel should be able to be covered. Bring the water to a gentle simmer.
Very generously brush the bottom and sides of the cake pan with oil. Place the oiled pan on the simmering water to warm it up. Give your batter a good stir, and then carefully pick up the pan (it’ll be hot), and pour some batter in. Swirl it around quickly so it evenly coats the bottom of the pan. For my 10” square pan, I used a 1/3 cup of batter at a time. (Make sure that you give the batter a good stir each time before using it, because the rice flour and water tends to separate a bit).
Once the pan is coated, place it on top of the simmering water, cover the pan, and steam for 3 minutes.
TO MAKE THE DIPPING SAUCE:
Add the sugar and water to a saucepan and heat until all of the sugar is fully dissolved. Add the dark soy sauce and oyster sauce and let simmer very very gently until the sauce is thin but coats the back of a spoon in a translucent layer. Set aside.
TO MAKE THE SHRIMP & SCALLION ROLLS:
When your cheung fun batter is ready, you can start making these. In a strainer, rinse the dried shrimp (if using) under running water. Soak them in warm water for 10 minutes. Drain, and roughly chop the shrimp. Set aside.
Add oil and chopped shrimp to a small pan over medium heat, and sauté for about 2 minutes. Add the salt and scallions, and stir until combined. Remove from the heat and set aside. If you’re not using the shrimp, simply sauté the scallions with oil and salt for 1 minute, and set aside.
Cook your rice noodle according to the instructions above and take the cake pan off the simmering water (if using store bought rice noodle sheets, simply lay the noodle out in a flat layer on a clean surface).
Spread 2 tablespoons of the shrimp and scallion mixture all over the surface of the noodle, and sprinkle some toasted sesame seeds over it as well. Use a rubber spatula to carefully part one side of the rice noodle from the pan, and roll it up in a tight cigar.
Remove to a cutting board and slice into 1-2 inch pieces with a sharp knife dipped in warm water. Plate and garnish with sesame seeds, scallions, and serve with your dipping sauce.
TO MAKE THE FRIED DOUGH ROLLS:
To make this Chinese fried dough rice roll, toast 2 crullers in the oven until crispy (instructions on the package. Usually a few minutes at 350 degrees F will do the trick). Split each cruller in half, since they often come with 2 stuck together.
Take your cooked rice noodles, and roll each half of a cruller in a rice noodle sheet. Cut into pieces and serve with your dipping sauce. (Note: the rice noodle I used for the cruller in these pictures was a little bit too thick, but you can adjust the thickness with practice and to your own personal preferences).",en-US,{},4.8,,The Woks of Life,105,6 serving(s)

In a small pot over medium low heat, dry roast the whole peppercorns of your choice for 15 minutes, until very fragrant. Take care not to burn them, adjusting the heat as needed. Cool completely and use a spice grinder or mortar and pestle to grind the peppercorns down to a powder.
In the same pot over medium heat, dry roast the salt until it turns slightly yellow in color. Let it cool and combine it with the ground pepper.

Transfer to a bowl, and add Shaoxing wine, salt, white pepper and canola oil. Mix until all the fish is coated. Set aside for 10 minutes before adding the cornstarch and tossing to coat. There should be no standing liquid or any visible dry cornstarch. Add a bit more cornstarch or pour off excess liquid as needed. Set aside.
In a small bowl, mix the hot chicken stock, sesame oil, salt, sugar, white pepper and oyster sauce. Set aside.
Boil enough water to blanch the vegetables in your wok. Add the carrots, asparagus, red bell pepper, and celery if using. After 15 seconds or until the water begins to simmer again, stir in the snow peas for 10 seconds, and quickly transfer the vegetables to a cool water bath. Drain thoroughly in a colander.
Velvet your fish, cooking it until it’s just shy of totally cooked through (the final cooking will take place when everything gets stir-fried together).
Option 1 - Water velveting: If you prefer to blanch your fish, wait until the water comes back to a boil, and gently place the fish chunks into the water. Bring back to a simmer. Gently scoop out the fish after about 2-3 minutes, and set aside.
Option 2 - Oil velveting or searing: Oil velveting is another word for frying the fish in hot oil—the most common restaurant technique. But searing the fish is a healthier alternative that uses a fraction of the oil. Heat the wok to high heat. Spread 2 tablespoons of canola oil around the wok. Once the oil starts to smoke, add the fish filets, and let them sear for a minute on each side. Transfer them to a plate when done. To boost your confidence for this step, see Judy’s technique for how to keep food from sticking to your wok.
Clean and dry the wok, and set it over medium heat. Add 1 tablespoon of oil and the julienned ginger. After 10 seconds, add the garlic, red onions, and scallions. Turn the heat to high, stir-frying the mixture for about 20 seconds. The wok should be sizzling and super hot.
Add the blanched vegetables, and stir fry for 30 seconds. Pour in the sauce mixture you prepared earlier. If your stove burner and wok lacks heat, pop the sauce into the microwave to heat it up for 10 seconds on high, so it doesn’t cool the wok when you add it!
Drizzle in about half of the cornstarch slurry, while stirring your vegetables. Now, gently pour the fish on top and fold the fish in with the vegetables. Add a bit more cornstarch slurry if there is still standing liquid. All the sauce should be clinging to the vegetables and fish. Make sure you cook the dish for 20 seconds after adding the cornstarch slurry to ensure that there’s no raw cornstarch flavor.
One last restaurant chef’s trick to make your dish more attractive is to add a drizzle of oil at the end to finish the dish right before you plate it.

Next, rub the Shaoxing wine all over the fish on both sides. Mix together the salt and white pepper and rub it all over both sides of the flounder.
Next, lightly dredge both sides of the fish with cornstarch. I sifted the cornstarch over both sides of the fish to get a uniform, light coating. If you don’t have a sifter or fine-meshed strainer to do this, you may need to use a lot more than 3 tablespoons of cornstarch to dredge the fish. You can also try patting it all over the fish with your hands and then shaking off the excess.
Heat a carbon steel wok or very large frying pan over high heat until it just starts to smoke. Next, pour ⅔ cup canola oil around the perimeter of the wok to ensure it is fully coated and turn the heat down to medium high. Carefully place your fish in the wok.
A fish of this size will need 5 to 6 minutes on each side. You should be getting a good sizzle in the wok, and the oil should be bubbling as you cook the fish. Tilt the wok or pan so the oil reaches all parts of the fish, and soon the flounder will begin to slide around the wok with ease. At this point, you will have to use your wok spatula to hold the fish gently while you continue to tilt the wok to cook the fish evenly. Make sure that the side fins, tail, and fish head are fried evenly as well. This process takes some coordination, but it sounds harder than it is!
Note that this fried flounder recipe calls for ⅔ cup of oil, but if you double the amount, you can get better, crispier results and have a much easier time frying the flounder. However, keep in mind that all but a few tablespoons of oil will be discarded in the end.
You can check the fish by gently lifting up one side the flounder with a wok spatula (so it’s perpendicular to the fish) to see that it fried up to an even golden brown. If it’s ready, just continue the flipping motion steadily to turn it over. Flounder is large and unwieldy, so you can use two spatulas to do this. Another tip is to tilt the wok up on the side you are flipping to make things easier. If you are right handed, tilt the left side of the wok up and use your right hand to flip the fish to your left. Continue frying for another 5 minutes, tilting the wok as needed to make sure the edges fry up to a crispy finish.
Once the flounder is done on both sides, carefully scoop/slide it from the wok to a large plate. Before you do this, there’s a presentation decision--do you serve the flounder dark side (the “top” of the fish) or light side up (the “bottom” that skims the ocean floor)? Many restaurants like to serve it lighter side up, but I like to serve it dark side up. It’s the natural position of the fish, and it sits on the plate a bit better.
One you’ve plated the fish, scoop out the oil into a heatproof bowl, and wipe your wok clean with a paper towel.
Next, in a small bowl, mix the 2 teaspoons of hot water with the sugar, soy sauce and Shaoxing wine.
Use a spoon to skim out 3 tablespoons of oil from the bowl you set aside, taking care not to pick up any particles, and pour back into the wok, set over medium high heat. When the wok is just smoking, pour the sauce mixture in, stirring it until it comes to a boil, then turn off the heat.
Use the spatula to spread half of the sauce evenly over the fish, topping it off with the finely julienned scallions and chopped cilantro. Reserve the other half of the sauce for after you debone the fish. Alternatively, you can let your guests fiddle with the bones themselves, and spoon the sauce over as they like.

Take each of the crab halves and lightly dredge each large piece in a light coating of flour. Transfer to a clean plate along with the claws and shells. Sprinkle the remaining flour over the crab pieces.
Heat a wok with 4 tablespoons of oil, spreading the oil around the wok so it heats evenly. You know you have reached the right temperature when you start to see just a little (not a lot!) of smoke on the sides of the wok. Now quickly place each of the large pieces of crab in the oil and spread the claws and shells around the outside portion of the wok.

Clean the wok, add 2 tablespoons of oil and toss in the ginger pieces until they are just starting to caramelize (15 seconds) and then add half of the scallions – use the white pieces for this step.
Keep the heat on high and move quickly to add the crab to wok and toss the crab around with your spatula to get some good sizzle. After about 10 seconds, add the wine in a circle around the pan and immediately cover the wok and turn the heat down to medium. Let the crab cook for 2-3 minutes. During this process, it is best to hold the cover and tilt the wok so the liquid hits the hot sides of the wok and you hear and see a sizzle generating that elusive “wok hay” flavor.

Repeat the process once more before transferring the moss to a colander to drain.
Soak the dried mushrooms in hot water for at least 90 minutes. You may need to soak them longer if the mushrooms are large and meaty. Soaking overnight is recommended.

Shandong Pork and Fish Dumplings (Jiaozi),Judy,https://thewoksoflife.com/shandong-pork-fish-dumplings/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/pork-fish-dumplings-7-1.jpg,"['6 cups all-purpose flour ((780g))', '2 cups water ((475 ml; use slightly less for those in humid climates))', '2½ pounds mackerel ((a little over 1 kg––should yield about 19 ounces/540g fish meat))', '12 ounces ground pork ((340g, can also substitute ground dark meat chicken))', '3 ounces Chinese garlic chives ((85g, finely chopped))', '1½ teaspoons salt', '3 tablespoons vegetable oil', '2 tablespoons sesame oil', '½ teaspoon white pepper', '¼ teaspoon ground Sichuan peppercorns', '½ teaspoon sugar', '¼ cup Shaoxing wine', '3 tablespoons light soy sauce', '1¼ cup cold water', '3 tablespoons ginger ((finely minced))', '¼ cup scallions ((minced))', '2 cloves garlic ((minced))', '1 tablespoon light soy sauce', '1 teaspoon water', '½ teaspoon homemade chili oil']","Start by making the dumpling dough. Add the all-purpose flour to the bowl of an electric mixer. With the mixer on low, slowly add the water. Run the mixer until the dough comes together into a smooth ball. 2 cups of water is a baseline. You may need less water in humid climates and more in drier climates/times of year (i.e. winter).
The finished dough should be soft and pliable, but not wet or sticky. Cover with an overturned bowl or plate, and let the dough rest on the counter for 1 hour. This gives the flour more time to absorb moisture, which will make the dough smoother and easier to work with. While the dough is resting, make the filling.
Take a spoon and scrape the fish meat a little bit at a time, discarding the tough membrane that’s left behind. Coarsely chop the fish (no need to make it into a paste-like texture at this stage). Add the fish to a large mixing bowl along with the rest of the filling ingredients. Whip in one direction using chopsticks or a wooden spoon for a good 5 minutes until the filling becomes gooey and sticky. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for 15 minutes.
Now we are ready to assemble the dumplings! When the dough is done resting, cut it into eighths. Take one of your smaller pieces of dough, keeping the rest of the pieces covered to prevent them from drying out. Roll the small piece of dough into a thick cylinder on a clean and lightly floured surface. Cut the cylinder into 10-gram pieces using a kitchen scale. Now take one piece, and roll it from edge to center with a small rolling pin as you turn the dough in a circular motion. The end result is a 3-inch diameter dumpling wrapper that has thinner edges and a slightly thicker center.
Add about a tablespoon of filling to the center, and fold the wrapper in half. Position the dumpling so that each side is held in place by your thumb and index finger (this is a two-handed operation). Then with gentle pressure, press the two sides of the wrappers closed tightly. At the same time, press the filling slightly downward, by bringing your wrists slightly closer. Practice will make perfect! Place the dumplings on a sheet pan lined with parchment paper.
Before you go too far down the road of making the dumplings, now is a good time to pause for a taste test. Boil a small pot of water just as you’re beginning to assemble the dumplings, and cook 2-3 test dumplings according to the cooking instructions below. Taste and adjust the seasoning accordingly before proceeding with the rest of the batch! You may want more Shaoxing wine, more vinegar, more ginger, or more soy sauce, for example.
Before cooking the dumplings, assemble the dipping sauce by combining all the sauce ingredients in a small bowl.
To cook the dumplings, make sure to cook them in small batches, since the filling is somewhat wet and the dumplings will loose their shape when left sitting for too long.
Fill a large soup pot halfway with water. Bring it to a boil. Add the dumplings, stirring the water slowly as you add them to prevent them from sticking to each other. Keep the pot uncovered.
Bring the water to a boil again, and then add 1 additional cup of cold water to stop the boiling process. As the pot of water continues to rise in temperature, repeat this previous step 3 until the dumplings are floating to the surface. The dumplings are cooked once the water has boiled after three instances of adding cold water. Scoop them out with a strainer or slotted spoon, and enjoy them right away with the dipping sauce.

Baked Stuffed Lobster with Shrimp,Bill,https://thewoksoflife.com/baked-stuffed-lobster/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/baked-stuffed-lobster-8.jpg,"['2 cold water lobsters ((Maine or Boston, about 1¼ to 1½ pounds each))', '10 shrimp ((35-40 size, about 4 ounces/110g, peeled, and de-veined))', 'Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste', '2 tablespoons olive oil', '8 tablespoons salted butter ((110g, melted))', '1 cup panko or dried breadcrumbs ((50g))', '½ teaspoon paprika', '½ teaspoon dried thyme', '⅛ teaspoon garlic powder', '1 teaspoon fresh chopped dill ((optional))', '¼ cup flat Italian parsley ((chopped))', '1/2 teaspoon freshly grated lemon zest', 'Lemon wedges ((to serve))']","Always start with fresh live hard shell lobsters from your local market or fish store. Most of the time, you will find hard shell lobsters at your local store but sometimes lobsters have a softer shell just after molting and their shells are not yet fully hard. Soft shell lobsters contain more water and in my opinion, have a sweeter taste and a more tender texture but they do contain a lot of water and less meat so a good, live hard shell lobster is best for baking.
Refrigerate your lobsters in the wax bag you get from the market which will keep them alive and fresh until you are ready to process them. The cold temperature will also keep them less active so they are easier to prepare. Putting them into the freezer for a few minutes will also do the trick.
Put each lobster on its back on a cutting board, and use a sharp chef’s knife to split it in half lengthwise without actually cutting the lobster all the way in half. You can easily do this by holding the lobster down at the claws just above the head. Insert the tip of the knife where the shell is soft between the legs, and carefully cut down lengthwise to the tail of the lobster. Remember to stop cutting when you reach the hard shell so you don’t penetrate it.
After the lobsters are split, use a pair of kitchen shears to trim off the antennae and the heads. Use both hands to split and flatten the lobsters lengthwise until they lie flat.
Discard the stomach sack and intestines, which are usually transparent but filled with dark material, and the dark sand track that goes down to the tail. Use the kitchen shears to make a small cross cut in the shell (be careful not to cut the meat) about halfway up the lobster tail on each side. This will help prevent the lobster tail from curling up when it cooks in the oven.
Next, remove the green tomalley and the roe, and set aside for the stuffing if you enjoy it, or discard. Rinse out each lobster under running water until clean. Pat the shells dry, and transfer to a sheet pan.
Clean and rinse the shrimp, and toss with a pinch of salt and freshly ground black pepper. Set aside.
Mix 2 tablespoons olive oil with 1 tablespoon melted butter, and brush the entire lobster––including the outside of the shells. At this point, reserve 4 tablespoons of the clarified melted butter in a small bowl for serving (clarified butter is the melted butter without the milk solids that float to the top).
Using a fork, mix the remaining butter with 1 cup of panko/breadcrumbs, 1/2 teaspoon paprika. 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme, 1/8 teaspoon garlic powder, 1 teaspoon fresh chopped dill, if using, 1/4 cup fresh chopped flat Italian parsley (reserve 1 tablespoon of parsley for garnish), and ½ teaspoon freshly grated lemon zest.
Evenly distribute the breadcrumbs into the cavities of the split lobsters, making sure you don’t pack the stuffing. It should be loose so the stuffing has a light and flakey texture. Next, lightly press five whole shrimp on top of the stuffing in each lobster.
Drizzle 1 teaspoon of the reserved clarified butter on top of the shrimp. You can add more butter in this step if you like. Heck you can add more butter at any step if you like!
Preheat the oven to 425 F, and bake the lobsters on the upper rack for 12 to 15 minutes, or until the meat is translucent. Don’t overcook the lobster, and remember it will continue to cook after you take it out! You can always put it back into the oven for more time, but you can’t reverse overcooking.
Transfer your lobsters to plates and sprinkle chopped parsley on top. Serve your stuffed baked lobster immediately with fresh lemon wedges and the melted butter you set aside earlier.",en-US,"{'calories': '426 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '11 g', 'proteinContent': '24 g', 'fatContent': '32 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '16 g', 'cholesterolContent': '253 mg', 'sodiumContent': '935 mg', 'fiberContent': '1 g', 'sugarContent': '1 g', 'servingSize': '1 serving'}",5.0,,The Woks of Life,60,4 serving(s)

Lobster Sticky Fried Rice,Bill,https://thewoksoflife.com/lobster-sticky-fried-rice/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/lobster-sticky-rice-13-1.jpg,"['2 whole live lobsters ((1¼ to 1½ pounds each))', '1 tablespoon all-purpose flour', '2 tablespoons cornstarch', '1½ cups sticky rice ((300g, also called sweet rice, soaked in 2 cups water for 30 minutes to 1 hour))', '2 cups vegetable oil ((for frying))', '2 eggs ((whites separated from the yolks))', '6 cloves garlic ((coarsely chopped))', '1 teaspoon ginger ((finely chopped))', '2 ounces Jinhua ham ((finely chopped, or any other dry cured ham))', '½ cup red onion ((diced))', '2 teaspoons Shaoxing wine', '¼ teaspoon salt ((or to taste))', '1 teaspoon dark soy sauce', '1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper', '¾ cup scallions ((finely chopped with white and green parts separated))']","Prep the lobster by dispatching them and cutting them into bite sized pieces.
Next, put the lobster pieces in a large bowl. Mix the flour and cornstarch together in a bowl and sprinkle it over the lobster. Toss until all the lobster is lightly coated.
Add the sticky rice (after soaking and draining) to a pot of 8 cups of boiling water and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Strain into a colander and give it quick rinse with cool water, and set aside to drain. Use a fork to break the rice up a bit before you add it to the wok to make the stir frying easier.
Heat 2 cups of oil in your wok over medium high heat. When little bubbles form around a bamboo or wooden chopstick dipped in the oil, it’s hot enough! Beat the egg yolks, and drizzle them into the oil to fry. They’ll cook quickly, be ready to immediately pick out the egg using a fine meshed strainer, and set aside.
Using the fine-mesh strainer, make sure there are no egg debris in your frying oil. Turn the heat down to low and fry the garlic at a low temperature (200F), until it’s light golden brown in color. Transfer to a dish using your fine-meshed strainer and set aside.
Now crank up the heat to medium high. When the oil reaches about 375 to 380 degrees F or until *just* smoking, fry the lobster in batches for 30 to 60 seconds for each batch, gently moving the lobster around with your metal wok spatula or until the shells just turn pink. Make sure the lobster is cooked, but not overcooked, or it will be rubbery! You must also let the oil come back up to temperature after each batch since the cold lobster cools down the hot oil significantly.
Drain the lobster pieces of excess oil using a spider or steel strainer and set aside in a large bowl. You can also move them to a wire rack to drain further. You will have leftover oil from frying the lobster, egg yolk and garlic. Pour the oil through a fine mesh strainer into a heatproof bowl. We’ll use some of this for the fried rice, but for the rest, let it cool, refrigerate it, and use it for cooking other recipes! The infused flavors will add good umami to other dishes, and it’s what many restaurants do!
Now it’s time to bring all these elements together. If your wok is on the smaller side, you may want to cook the sticky rice in two batches!
Add 1 tablespoon of the frying oil to the wok set over medium-low heat, and add the chopped ginger. Gently caramelize the ginger, taking extra care not to burn it.
Next, add the Jinhua ham, and let it fry for 30 seconds. You can use dry-cured Virginia ham as a substitute for the Jinhua ham, which is much harder to find! Next, add the chopped red onion, and stir fry for 30 seconds, or until fragrant and just softened.
Add the par-boiled sticky rice and stir-fry for 2 minutes or until reheated. Beat the egg whites with a fork until frothy and pour on top of the rice. Continue stir-frying for another 1 to 2 minutes, or until the rice is coated in the egg white.
Spread the Shaoxing wine around the perimeter of the wok, and add the salt and dark soy sauce. Stir fry until combined, and add the fried egg yolks, the white pepper, and the white parts of the scallions,
Next, add the lobster and any juices from the bowl, and gently fold the lobster into the rice using your wok spatula until well combined. Then add half of the fried garlic and the green parts of the scallions.

The taro will be slightly wet and starchy after it is julienned, which is exactly what you want for maximum adhesion. Take another steel mesh strainer of the same size and place it over the top so the taro strands are sandwiched between the two strainers.
In a wok or pot, heat 6 cups of oil to 325 degrees F (use a thermometer to check the temperature), and place the “nest,” still sandwiched between the two strainers, in the oil. Fry until golden brown, tilting the basket in different angles so the entire taro basket is fried evenly. Using a wok for frying is ideal, as you will have more room without having to use excessive amounts of oil, but a deep pot large enough for the basket will work also. Be sure to place the taro basket in the pot slowly and use the utmost caution! Using a deeper pot or wok also makes frying safer since the taro basket, when first placed into the oil, will cause the oil to expand and overflow if your pot is too small and if your oil is too close to the top of the pot.
For the seafood, make sure your shrimp and scallops are cleaned.
Prepare the squid by separating the tentacles and body and removing the hard skeleton parts. Use the tentacles as is, and set them aside to drain. Cut the mantle so you have flat pieces, and remove the inside skeleton. Cut the flat pieces into 2 by 3 inch rectangles, and score them diagonally in a criss-cross pattern, making sure not to cut the squid all the way through.
Bring 6 cups of water to a boil in your wok, and blanch the shrimp and scallops by slowly stirring them in the water until just opaque (about 20 seconds), and transfer to a plate. The shrimp and scallops should be just 70% cooked, since they will be cooked again in the stir-fry step of the dish.
Add the squid to the hot water, and blanch until they are curled, or about 10 seconds, and transfer these to a plate. Asian grocery stores sometimes stock prepared squid that is cut and blanched into curls in the freezer section; if you have access, it’s a handy shortcut!
Heat your wok over medium-high heat, and coat the perimeter of the wok with two tablespoons of oil. Heat until the oil slides easily around the wok and starts to shimmer.
Add the ginger slices to the wok, and let fry for about 10 seconds. Add the scallion and garlic, and stir-fry for another 10 seconds.
Next, add the carrots, bamboo shoots, and peppers, and turn the heat up to high. Give everything a good stir-fry for 30 seconds, and then add the straw mushrooms, snap peas, and onion.
Next, stir in the seafood, and add the Shaoxing wine. Stir-fry everything for another minute and add the hot chicken stock. It’s important to add hot or even boiling chicken stock to keep the wok up to temperature, especially since most average stoves can have trouble generating enough heat for a good stir fry in the first place. You can also add more or less chicken stock depending on how much sauce you want in the dish.
While the mixture is coming up to a boil, add the salt, sugar, white pepper, and sesame oil, and stir everything until well combined. Taste the sauce with a spoon, and add more seasonings to your preference, but be quick about it, or your seafood may overcook!
Mix together the cornstarch and water so that it’s uniformly combined, and add to the wok slowly while stirring. Again, you can add more, less, or leave it out entirely depending upon your taste preferences, but it’s best to get to a consistency so that the sauce coats all of the ingredients.
Carefully spoon the mixture into your taro basket, and serve immediately!",en-US,"{'calories': '439 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '30 g', 'proteinContent': '18 g', 'fatContent': '28 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '2 g', 'cholesterolContent': '145 mg', 'sodiumContent': '866 mg', 'fiberContent': '5 g', 'sugarContent': '4 g', 'servingSize': '1 serving'}",5.0,,The Woks of Life,60,6 serving(s)

Now we’re ready to begin cooking! Heat the oil in a thick-bottomed soup pot over medium heat. Stir-fry the shrimp heads along with half of the julienned ginger for a couple of minutes, until they turn crispy and the oil turns a deep red color. Then add in the water, and bring it to a boil. Turn down the heat to medium low, and simmer for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, turn off the heat, and scoop out/discard the shrimp heads.
Next, add the frozen white rice and Shaoxing wine, bring to a boil again, and cook for 15 minutes over medium heat. The congee should be bubbling gently. Remember to stir from the bottom periodically to prevent the rice from sticking. After 15 minutes, add in the cleaned shrimp and crab.

Peel the shrimp, only leaving the small segment of shell that connects to the tail. Place the shrimp on its side with its underbelly facing you. Holding the shrimp with one hand, use the tip of your knife to split the tail shell.
Next, use a steady, yet light pressure to push the knife into the shrimp, splitting it evenly down the middle until it just reaches the outer membrane. No sudden or quick cutting motions, and if you’re a beginner, you can use a cut-proof glove. At this point, you should be able to spread the shrimp out flat on the cutting board. Press the shrimp lightly into the board to flatten it out further if needed, especially on the tail shell.
Next, carefully remove the vein from the middle of the shrimp that runs along the backside. There may also be a vein along the edges of the shrimp from the underside of the shrimp as well. You can use your knife to gently scrape these veins away if you see them. There you have it! A perfectly butterflied shrimp!
Assemble the Shrimp
Next, rinse the shrimp clean under running water. Pat the shrimp dry with a kitchen towel and return to the cutting board, backside down. Season the shrimp with a light sprinkle of salt. Cut the slices of bacon to match the length of the shrimp. Gently press them onto the shrimp.
Mix 1 tablespoon soy sauce, 1 teaspoon worcestershire sauce, 2 teaspoons tomato ketchup, ¼ teaspoon white pepper, and ½ teaspoon sesame oil in a small bowl. Set aside.
Heat your wok over medium high heat; don’t let the wok get to the point where it’s smoking. Spread 2 tablespoons of oil around the wok to coat it thoroughly. Dip the shrimp into the beaten egg. Let the excess egg drip off, and place the shrimp in the wok, bacon-side down. Work quickly to place all of the shrimp. Turn up the heat as needed to make sure the egg and bacon cook through.
Cook the bacon-side of the shrimp for 60-90 seconds or until the bacon is golden brown. Carefully use your wok spatula to turn the shrimp and cook for another 30-60 seconds, flipping them in the same order you placed them. Transfer the shrimp to a plate.
Heat the wok over medium heat and add 1 tablespoon of oil. Retain all of the flavor in the wok from frying the shrimp. Add the minced garlic and onions, and turn the heat up to high. Stir-fry the onions for 30 seconds, and add the Shaoxing wine. After another 30 seconds, add the sauce mixture, and stir until the onions are coated. Add the scallions.

Prepare your steaming set-up, and fill with 1-2 inches of water. Bring to a boil.
Rinse your fish fillet, and carefully lay it on an oblong heat-proof plate that will fit into your wok or steaming setup. Carefully place it in the steamer, and adjust the heat to medium.

Cover and steam for 7-10 minutes depending upon the size and thickness of your fish fillet. If you have extremely small, thin fillets (half an inch), cook for 4-5 minutes. Check for doneness using a butter knife. If it falls easily through the thickest part of the fillet to the bottom of the plate, the fish is done.

Add 1 tablespoon of Shaoxing wine to each bowl, and pour enough boiling water over the top to submerge the seafood. Soak the shrimp for one hour. Soak the scallops for at least 2 hours (up to 6 hours).
While that’s happening, prepare your shallots and garlic. I highly recommend using a food processor for this. Thinly slice the shallots first by hand, and then pulse into a fine dice. Pulse the whole garlic cloves until minced. Prepare the chili peppers and set aside as well.
When the soaking times have elapsed, drain the seafood. Heat your steamer over high heat, and steam the scallops and the ham in heatproof bowls for 15 minutes. Reserve any liquid that dripped into the bowl with the scallops.
When the 15 minutes have elapsed, remove both from the steamer and let cool. Shred the scallops into threads by breaking them up between your fingers. Using a food processor, pulse the scallops about 6-7 times, in 3 batches, until they resemble short, fine threads. Next, pulse the shrimp about 7-8 times, or until they resemble coarse crumbs. Mince the ham by hand--best to avoid your expensive jinhua ham from resembling cat food!
Collect the water from steaming the scallops (whatever dripped off into the bowl that the scallops were in while you were steaming––the amount will vary each time you do it, and that’s fine), and mix with 1¾ cups chicken stock and 2 tablespoons brown sugar. Set aside.
In a large wok, heat your 7 cups of oil to 225 degrees F--it’s hot enough when a chopstick dipped in the oil bubbles slightly. The oil temperature for the duration of the cooking process can vacillate between 200 and 250 degrees F, or on your stovetop, between medium-high and high heat, depending on what you are adding to the oil and how much. If your wok is too small for safe frying, use any other large, deep pot. A dutch oven would also work well.
Add all of the scallops and let fry for 5 minutes. Next, add the shrimp. Fry the mixture for 15 minutes. Next, add the ham and cook for an additional 3 minutes. Add the chopped chili peppers and cook for an additional 3 minutes.
Turn off the heat. Using a fine-meshed strainer, transfer the seafood mixture to another large skillet or wok, letting the oil drain off.
Turn the heat on again and let the oil come back up to 225F. Add the shallots. Let fry for 10 minutes. They should become slightly golden but not crispy.
While that’s happening, heat your second wok over medium-high heat. Add the last 6 tablespoons of Shaoxing wine, the 2 tablespoons of dark mushroom soy sauce, and the sugar/chicken stock mixture you prepared earlier. Stir to combine, and simmer to let the liquid cook off.
Next, add the garlic to the shallots and cook for 10 minutes, keeping an eye on your second wok. The garlic should get golden and slightly crisped.
When the liquid has cooked off in your seafood mixture and the shallot/garlic mixture is the correct color, carefully pour the seafood mixture back into the main wok. Lower the heat to medium and stir to combine. Add the fish sauce and chili flakes, stirring to combine.
Transfer to clean, sterile containers, and let cool on the counters before refrigerating. You can eat the XO sauce right away or you can let the flavors meld for 2 to 3 days before digging in!

The shrimp should be headless with the shells on, but make sure they are not deveined with the backs cut open. In order to butterfly the shrimp, the back of the shrimp should be intact. It will hold both sides of the butterflied shrimp together. You’ll also keep the shrimp tails in place for the final dish.
Peel the shrimp, only leaving the small segment of shell that connects to the tail. If you like, you can scrape the tails to remove the liquid inside the tails, since we are deep-frying the shrimp.
Place the shrimp on its side with its underbelly facing you. Holding the shrimp with one hand, use the tip of your knife to split the tail shell.
Next, use a steady, yet light pressure to push the knife into the shrimp, splitting it evenly down the middle until it just reaches the outer membrane. Be sure to remove any sand tracts and give the shrimp a quick rinse if needed.
Pat the shrimp dry on both sides and use ¼ teaspoon of salt to lightly salt them (or salt to taste).
Making the batter:
Mix 3/4 cup all purpose flour and the rest of the dry ingredients together in a bowl. Add ice water and vegetable oil. Mix until a batter is formed, and set aside for 5 minutes.
Making the sauce:
In a small saucepan over medium heat, add 1 teaspoon oil and add the ketchup. Fry for 30 seconds on low heat until it just begins to caramelize, and stir in white vinegar, soy sauce, sesame oil, white pepper, and the cornstarch mixture.
Continue to stir the sauce until it is simmering. Once it is thick enough to coat a spoon, remove to a serving bowl and set aside.
Frying:
Heat 3-4 cups of oil in a small pot to 325 degrees F (the oil level should be about halfway up the pot).
Place ¼ cup of all-purpose flour on a small plate, and lightly dredge the shrimp, shaking off any excess. Dip the shrimp into the batter, and let any excess batter drip off. You can use your own discretion here on how much batter to use. Some like a light batter and some like it heavier.

It will take a while for the oil to heat up. The oil should be between 350-375F. You can use a spare piece of potato to check if the oil’s ready (if it sizzles right away when inserted into the oil, then you’ve got the right temperature) or use a trusty kitchen thermometer.
To make the potato wedges, prepare your potatoes. Soak them in a large bowl of water, drain, then dump them onto a kitchen towel to blot them dry. Then, in a separate bowl, combine the flour, paprika, black pepper, and salt. Add the potatoes and toss thoroughly to coat.
The potato wedges should be fried first for about 10 to 11 minutes until golden brown. Transfer to a plate lined with paper towels or a good old paper plate. If you like the wedges really crispy, you can then refry them for 1 to 2 minutes when ready to serve.
While the potatoes are cooking, whip up your tartar sauce. Combine the mayonnaise, lemon juice, chopped pickle, shallot, salt and pepper in a bowl and stir to combine. Set aside until you’re ready to eat!
To make the fish batter, mix all of the dry ingredients in a medium-sized bowl. Add the oil and beer and stir until well-combined. Next, fold in the finely-crushed white or yellow corn tortilla chips, and let the batter rest for 20 minutes.
Make sure the oil is still hot after frying the potatoes. It’s important to maintain a nice solid bed of hot coals that will take you through the cooking process from start to finish, or you can use a portable gas burner.
Make sure the fish fillets are well drained and patted dry with paper towels if necessary. Lightly dredge them with the last ¼ cup of flour. Next, grab the end of one filet and dip both sides in the batter until well coated, letting the excess drip back into the bowl.
Lower the fillet into the oil carefully, slowly swishing the lower half of the filet once or twice so the oil cooks it partially; then lower the rest in one steady motion. This ensures the batter cooks just enough so that it won't stick to the pot when you drop in the rest of the filet. The key to frying is to not be afraid of the hot oil. Dropping the fish in with a splash is dangerous, so be sure to use a slow and steady hand.
Ideally, you want the initial frying temperature to be 375F since the first batch will cool the oil immediately. The temperature will drop to 350F which is okay, but any lower than 350F, and you'll get a soggy piece of fish. Any higher, and your batter may burn. Fry the fish for a total of 4 to 5 minutes on each side, but do turn them frequently. A pretty good proxy is when the batter is golden brown and crisp.
Transfer the fried fish to a plate lined with paper towels and serve hot with the potato wedges and tartar sauce on the side. It will be the best camping meal you’ll ever have!",en-US,{},4.88,,The Woks of Life,35,8 serving(s)

Add the lemongrass, cilantro (coriander), shallots, and garlic to a mortar and pestle, and pound until pulverized. You can also use a food processor for this step.
Add the oil, sugar, salt, black pepper, Thai soy sauces, fish sauce and turmeric (if using). Mix until well-combined.
You can butterfly or spatchcock your chicken for grilling like it’s done on the streets of Thailand. However, I cut the chicken into individual pieces to ensure they’d cook properly. This way, I can pull each piece off the grill once cooked. Rub the chicken with the marinade paste, ensuring every piece is thoroughly coated. Cover and place in the refrigerator to marinate overnight (or at least 12 hours).
The next day, take the chicken out 1 to 2 hours before you’re ready to grill.
Make the sauce:
In a small bowl, mix the sugar and hot water until the sugar is dissolved. Mix in the rest of the sauce ingredients and set aside.
Cook the chicken:
Place the chicken on the grill, and use any remaining marinade to baste the chicken while grilling. Leave the marinade paste on the chicken, including any chunks of herbs as they will caramelize and add flavor. Turn and baste the chicken often to create a nice flavorful outer crust. Baste the chicken with the leftover marinade in the first half of the grilling process, but do not do this towards the end of cooking. The raw chicken marinade needs enough time to fully cook.

Let the noodles cook for 1 to 2 minutes, and adjust the heat as needed--lower if the noodles start to scorch or higher to lightly brown the noodles. The wok should not be smoking at this point!
Flip the noodles over, and add another tablespoon of oil around the perimeter of the wok to let the other “side” of the noodles crisp. Don’t stress if you can’t turn the noodles over in one shot, The goal here is just to get an even, light crispiness during this cooking stage. After 90 seconds, flip the noodles again and you should start to see a light browning of the noodles, with some areas where the noodles are crispier. Cook for another 2 minutes, flipping the noodles again, and transfer them to a plate.
Heat the wok to medium high, and add 1 tablespoon of oil to coat the wok. Stir-fry the mushrooms for about a minute, then push the mushrooms to the side, and turn the heat down to medium.
Add another ½ tablespoon of oil in the middle of the wok, and add the julienned ginger to the oil. Let the ginger caramelize for about 15 seconds. Next, add the shrimp and stir-fry for 15 seconds. Turn the heat up to high, and add 1 teaspoon of Shaoxing wine. Stir-fry for another 45 seconds, until the shrimp are about 80% done.
Add the noodles, and pour the soy sauce mixture over the top. Quickly stir-fry the noodles with a lifting motion until the sauce is well-incorporated--about 30-45 seconds.
Toss in the scallions and the mung bean sprouts, and stir-fry everything for another minute. The wok should be at its hottest now to help you achieve that wok hay flavor. Transfer the noodles to a serving dish (before the scallions and bean sprouts wilt--they should still be somewhat fresh and crunchy).

Shanghai Shrimp Stir-fry - You Bao Xia (油爆虾),Judy,https://thewoksoflife.com/shrimp-stir-fry-shanghai/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/shanghai-style-shrimp-15.jpg,"['1 pound medium shrimp ((450g, size: 21/30))', '1 cup oil ((for frying))', '2 scallions ((white portion only, save the green portion for another day))', '3 slices ginger', '1 tablespoon Shaoxing wine', '1/2 cup chicken broth', '1 teaspoon sugar', '1/4 teaspoon Chinese black vinegar', '1 teaspoon sesame oil', 'Salt ((to taste))']","Start by preparing the shrimp. Using kitchen shears, trim off the legs and the sharp pointy part at the top of the head. Then devein the shrimp by using a toothpick to carefully expose and pull it out, without damaging the shell (see the photo!). Rinse the shrimp thoroughly, drain, and pat dry with a paper towel.
Heat the oil in a wok over high heat until it just starts to smoke. Carefully lower the shrimp into the oil in two batches, frying gently for about 5 - 10 seconds with each batch. The shrimp will go opaque very quickly. Immediately scoop them out into a metal strainer, to drain excess oil back into the wok. Set the shrimp aside.
Now, let the oil heat up again until it's smoking. Lower the shrimp into the oil again (in two separate batches), and fry for another 5 - 10 seconds. The frying time varies depending on shrimp size––over frying will dry out the shrimp.
Turn off the heat and scoop out the oil into a heat-proof bowl, leaving about 1 tablespoon of oil in the wok. Turn the heat on to low and add in the scallion whites and ginger. Cook for 2 minutes, until fragrant. Add the Shaoxing wine, chicken broth, sugar and vinegar. Turn up the heat, so the mixture comes to a simmer. Stir for 30 seconds.
At this point, you can choose to remove the scallions and ginger from the wok, or simply leave them in there! Finally, add the shrimp back to the wok along with the sesame oil. Stir-fry for 5-10 seconds, until the shrimp are coated in the sauce.

Wrap the fish in fresh paper towels while you prepare the rest of the ingredients. The goal is to make the fish as dry as absolutely possible. Use a sharp knife to score both sides of the fish three times.
Once the prep work is done, unwrap the fish and dust it with a thin, even layer of cornstarch on both sides. This step will help keep the skin in tact during pan-frying.
Heat the wok until it starts to smoke, and immediately add the oil and ginger slices. Reduce the heat to medium. Once the ginger slices start to brown, remove them from the wok and set aside. Carefully lay the fish in the wok, and DO EVERYTHING IN YOUR POWER NOT TO MOVE OR TOUCH THE FISH for the next 5 minutes. You can tilt the wok around so the oil glides around to evenly brown the fish.
After 5 minutes, shake the wok slightly to see if the fish has seared enough to stop sticking to the wok. This is when you can carefully flip the fish over and do the same process for the other side.
Once both sides are nicely browned, add the ginger back to the wok along with the scallions, shaoxing wine, sugar, vinegar, dark soy sauce and light soy sauce. Keep the heat at medium low, and cook the fish by continuously spooning the cooking liquid over the fish. Cook on each side for 4-5 minutes. By now, the sauce should be cooked down and almost syrupy.

While the dried peppers are soaking, de-stem and de-seed the Holland peppers, removing the membranes as well. You can leave the seeds in if you like your sauce very spicy. Cut each pepper into 3 pieces. If using, chop the Thai chilies.
Take half of your shallots and finely chop them. With the other half, thinly slice them. (You can also chop them, but I think slices add another textural dimension to the final sauce.
Drain the dried chili peppers, and set aside the soaking water. To the bowl of a food processor or blender, add the dried peppers, Holland peppers, Thai chilies (if using), half of the shallots (i.e. your chopped shallots, setting aside the slices for later), and garlic. Pulse until the mixture is smooth, or if you prefer, a coarse paste. Use a rubber spatula to scrape down the sides of the bowl to ensure the mixture is evenly processed.
Heat a frying pan or wok over medium heat. Add the oil and chopped dried shrimp. Fry over medium to medium low heat for 3-5 minutes.
Put the belacan in a mortar and pestle to break it up (you can also put it in a small bowl and break it up with a fork). Add it to the pan. Cook for 3-4 minutes, until the belacan is melted into the sauce.

Using your spatula, spread the rice out into an even layer along the surface of the wok. Pour the beaten egg evenly over the rice. Stir the rice until all of the egg is cooked and incorporated.

Take a 1-pound salmon fillet, and cut it into large chunks. If it has skin, remove it. (We saved the skin and seared it to a delicious crisp and proceeded to have an impromptu chef’s snack with white rice and roasted seaweed. Epic. Don’t be that person who throws away perfectly delicious salmon skin.)
Divide the salmon into 2 portions--one-third and two-thirds. For one-third of the salmon, pulse 6 times. For the other two-thirds, pulse 4 times. This ensures that the patties have a nice texture. Transfer to a mixing bowl, and add the panko, egg, 2 tablespoons of olive oil, dijon mustard, and tarragon. Form into 3 patties, ½-inch thick.
In a separate small bowl, make the seasoning. Combine the salt, black pepper, paprika, cayenne, garlic powder, and onion powder. Sprinkle on both sides of each patty. Transfer the patties to the refrigerator while you prepare the rest of the burger components.
To make the green goddess dressing, combine the mayonnaise, Greek yogurt, herbs, anchovies, lemon juice, salt, and black pepper in a food processor or blender and blend until smooth. Easy, right?
Next, you’re ready to cook your salmon patties. Heat a cast-iron skillet over high heat with 2 tablespoons of oil. When it’s really hot, carefully place the salmon patties in the pan and cook for 2-3 minutes. When golden brown, flip the patties, and cook for another 2-3 minutes on the other side.

This is why the recipe calls for a range of 3 to 4 cups. When the oil reaches 325 degrees F, fry the walnuts for about 4 minutes. They are ready when they start to turn a golden brown color. Some people like their walnuts more or less toasted, so you can experiment to your own taste. The difference is really in the last 30 to 60 seconds, so make that decision quickly!
While the oil is heating, pour 2 tablespoons of water, granulated sugar and a pinch of salt into a small saucepan over low heat to make your simple syrup. Stir occasionally to reduce, 3 to 5 minutes. Once the walnuts are done, scoop them out quickly with a slotted spoon, draining as much oil off as possible. Transfer them to the saucepan with your simple syrup.
Continue stirring the walnuts in the simple syrup over medium low heat until there is no remaining liquid in the saucepan, and the syrup is completely coating the walnuts without dripping off. This step is important, because you want a thin and hard candy coating on your walnuts. If you take them out too early, they will be chewy rather than crunchy. When they are ready, transfer them to a parchment lined sheet pan, spreading them out so they are not touching each other.
Next, combine the mayonnaise, condensed milk, rice vinegar, and salt in a small bowl, and stir until smooth. Set aside. You want this sauce to be at room temperature.
Prepare the cleaned shrimp by first making the cuts on the back of the shrimp deeper, so they get a nice coating and will open up into a nice shape when fried.
Dredge the shrimp in cornstarch lightly and set aside. Keep the remaining cornstarch handy, because you will probably have to lightly dredge again just before frying.
Bring a pot of water to a boil for your broccoli, and add 1 teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon oil to the pot. Blanch the broccoli florets for 30 seconds, and immediately scoop them out. Transfer to a bowl of cold water to stop the cooking process. After 10 to 15 seconds in the water, drain into a colander. The broccoli should still be very warm, but the shock of the cold water will keep them green. Next, arrange them around the perimeter of a serving plate. Cook the broccoli just before you fry the shrimp, as the broccoli should be warm when served.
Next, bring your frying oil (the same oil you used for the walnuts) up to 350 degrees F and dredge the shrimp for a second time in the remaining cornstarch, since the shrimp may have absorbed some of the cornstarch from the first dredging. Drop the shrimp one at a time into the oil carefully, but quickly in succession. You will have to do this in several batches, depending on the size of your pot. Keep in mind, you don’t want the shrimp to stick together, and you want to move quickly to drop in each batch of shrimp at around the same time so that they cook evenly and are done at the same time.
Fry the shrimp in batches until golden brown, about 2 to 3 minutes. Gently roll them around in the oil so they fry evenly, but take care so none of the oil splashes out of the pot.
Transfer the fried shrimp to a large stainless steel mixing bowl. When all the shrimp have been fried, pour the creamy sauce mixture on top of the shrimp, and gently toss the shrimp in the sauce until coated. This process should be quick!

Add the ginger and allow it to caramelize (about 20 seconds), taking care not to burn it.
Next, add the garlic, scallion, peppers and fermented black beans, and stir fry the mixture for about 10 seconds. Add the clams. Pour the Shaoxing wine around the perimeter of the wok, and immediately cover the wok. Cook until the clams begin to open. At this point, the liquid in the wok should be boiling and generating steam when the wok is covered. The time for the clams to cook and open up depends upon the size and type of the clams you are using and how hot you can get your stove. Once a good number of them have opened, remove the cover and give everything a stir.
Stir in the sugar, sesame oil, pepper. Discard any of the clams that didn't open. Now taste the sauce. If it's not salty enough, you can add a little bit of soy sauce. Once your satisfied with the flavor of the sauce, add about half of the corn starch slurry to the liquid in the wok and stir. Add more slurry if needed to further thicken the sauce.
Stir in the chopped cilantro and gently stir the mixture so the sauce coats the clams.

Use a fork and mix everything together vigorously until the pork mixture becomes sticky and smooth––almost like a paste. Set aside to marinate for 1 hour.
Transfer the meat to a deep dish plate, forming a kind of thin patty. You must use a deep dish because liquid will pool in the bowl (it's almost like a thin broth or sauce, and it's great over rice!).
Distribute the slices of salted fish on top of the meat. If you put a lot of fish on top, then you may want to eliminate or reduce the salt from the ground meat in the previous step. If you put only a few slices of salted fish, then the fish will likely provide enough salt for the dish. It’s definitely about personal preferences when it comes to how salty you like it!
Spread the julienned ginger across the top of the meat and salted fish and then sprinkle the chopped scallion evenly over the top. Steam for 10 minutes starting with a pre-heated steamer. You'll see quite a bit of liquid in the plate after cooking. Turn off the heat and let the dish rest for 2 to 3 minutes. Some of that tasty liquid will be reabsorbed into the meat.

Shrimp Rice Noodle Rolls (Shrimp Cheung Fun or “Ha Cheung”),Judy,https://thewoksoflife.com/shrimp-rice-noodle-rolls-cheung-fun/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/shrimp-rice-rolls.jpg,"['8 ounces shrimp ((16 total 31/40 size shrimp, peeled and deveined))', '2 tablespoons water', '1/2 teaspoon sugar', '1/8 teaspoon baking soda', '1/4 teaspoon sesame oil', '1/8 teaspoon salt', '1/2 teaspoon cornstarch', '1/4 teaspoon white pepper', '1 scallion', '6 slices ginger', '2 ½ tablespoons light soy sauce', '2 teaspoons dark soy sauce', '5 teaspoons sugar', '1/3 cup water', '1 teaspoon oyster sauce', '1 teaspoon oil', 'Salt ((to taste))', '5 tablespoons rice flour ((40g))', '1 tablespoon mung bean starch ((9g))', '2 tablespoons wheat starch ((18g))', '2 tablespoons cornstarch ((18g))', '1/4 teaspoon salt', '1 cup water ((235 ml))', 'Vegetable or canola oil (for brushing)']","To Prepare the Shrimp:
Toss the cleaned shrimp with 2 tablespoons water, 1/2 teaspoon sugar and 1/8 teaspoon baking soda. After the shrimp have been coated, cover and refrigerate for 2 hours.
After 2 hours, rinse the shrimp under a gentle stream of cold running water for 5 minutes to wash away the sugar and baking soda and pat thoroughly dry with a paper towel. This will greatly improve the texture of the shrimp!
Marinate the shrimp with 1/4 teaspoon sesame oil, a pinch of salt, 1/2 teaspoon cornstarch, and 1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper. Cover and return to the refrigerator while you prepare the rest of the ingredients.
To Make the Sauce:
Prepare the sauce by adding all the ingredients to a small saucepan over medium low heat. Heat the sauce until it begins to simmer, and turn off the heat. Cool completely and remove the ginger and scallion. You can store this sauce in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.
To Prepare the Rice Noodle Rolls:
Combine the rice flour, mung bean starch, wheat starch, cornstarch, and salt in a large mixing bowl. Add the water and stir for at least three minutes until dry ingredients are well dissolved. Set aside and allow time for any air bubbles to dissipate.
Soak the cotton cloth in water so it’s completely saturated. Prepare a large assembly station by brushing some oil on a clean, smooth surface like a non-porous countertop, a large flat plate, or a smooth cutting board.
Pre-boil water in your steamer with the lid on (more on how to set up a steamer here), and make sure your steamer fits the flat-bottomed pan you will use to steam the rice noodles. I used a 9 x 13 non-stick sheet pan. This recipe makes 2 full sheets of rice noodles in this sized pan (equivalent to almost 3 dim sum orders).
First, place the shrimp in a single layer on a plate, and steam them for 2 minutes. Remove them immediately and set aside.
Now lift the soaking wet cotton cloth out of the water and line the bottom of the pan with it. (Do not wring out the water.) Stir the rice-flour liquid mixture well again before adding just enough to cover the cloth at the bottom of the pan completely. Too much will make the rice noodle too thick. With the water in your steamer boiling, use the plate gripper and carefully lower the pan into the steamer, immediately cover the lid and steam on high for 2 minutes. (MAKE SURE THE PAN IS PERFECTLY LEVEL, or the noodle will be too thick on one side and too thin on the other.)
Then remove the pan from the steamer with the plate gripper and position it next to your assembly station.
Carefully lift the cloth out of the pan, and place (rice noodle side down) onto the oiled surface. Use the dough scraper and carefully scrape the rice noodle sheet off the cotton cloth onto the oiled surface. Scrape and peel off the cotton cloth at the same time. This step must happen quickly while the noodle and cotton cloth are still hot. The noodle might have a small hole here or there––don’t fret. It does not affect the overall end result.
Cut the rice noodle in half crosswise and line up four cooked shrimp along the edge of each piece. Roll the rice sheet using the plastic dough scraper to wrap up the shrimp. At this point, you’ll have two long rolls. Cut each in half, drizzle with the prepared sauce, and eat it while it’s hot.
Rinse the cotton cloth in clean water (no soap or detergent necessary) to remove rice residue before making the next one. These are best when fresh. In this case, we discourage leftovers!

After a few minutes, live mussels with their shells opened should close up. Discard any mussels whose shells remain open. Scrub any loose barnacles off each mussel shell. Transfer to another clean bowl of water.
Pull off any visible “beards” of seaweed that are attached to the mussels, using a kitchen cloth to grip the seaweed and firmly pull until they come off. After all the mussels are cleaned, toss them in a fresh bowl of water to clean any remaining loose particles. Pour them into a large colander to drain.
Repeat this procedure of soaking and draining if you see there’s sand at the bottom of the bowl. Soaking the mussels longer helps the mussels expel more sand. Once there’s no sand remaining, transfer the mussels to a colander to drain.
Prepare your sliced bread, mixing the extra virgin olive oil, salt, and a pinch of minced garlic together to spread / brush over the bread. You can prepare the garlic toast ahead of time on a sheet pan and place them under a broiler so they toast quickly.
Add 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil to a large thick-bottomed pot on medium low heat. Add 4 cloves chopped garlic, 2 sprigs fresh thyme, ½ cup chopped onions or shallots, and saute until transparent and fragrant (about 5 minutes).
Turn the heat up to high, and add the cleaned mussels, ¼ teaspoon salt and ¼ teaspoon sugar (this balances the acidity in the wine). Stir well. Add ⅓ cup dry white wine, and half of the parsley or carrot greens. Give everything a good stir with a large metal spoon, scooping from the bottom up. Cover the pot tightly. After 1 minute, give everything another stir. You should start to see some mussels opening.
Cover tightly, and let your mussels cook until the liquid boils--about 2 minutes. Give everything another stir so the mussels cook evenly. Put the cover back on and let the mussels cook for another 2 minutes. Check to see all mussels have opened and at this point, you can discard any that have not opened their shells.
Stir in the rest of your chopped parsley or carrot greens and fresh pepper to taste.
Carefully pour your steamed mussels and broth into a large serving bowl (we serve them right out of the pot to keep them hot!), and serve immediately along with the toasted garlic bread––perfect for dipping into the flavorful broth.",en-US,"{'calories': '243 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '10 g', 'proteinContent': '21 g', 'fatContent': '11 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '2 g', 'cholesterolContent': '49 mg', 'sodiumContent': '646 mg', 'fiberContent': '1 g', 'sugarContent': '1 g', 'servingSize': '1 serving'}",5.0,,The Woks of Life,60,4 serving(s)

Heat 3 cups of oil in a small pot (to conserve oil) to 380 degrees F. You can use a thermometer or check the temperature by putting a drop of batter into the oil. The batter should not turn brown right away. Instead, it should rise immediately to the surface and turn a very light golden brown.
To make the batter, mix together all the dry ingredients––the flour, baking powder, cornstarch, salt, turmeric, and white pepper. When you’re ready to fry, mix in the sesame oil and cold seltzer water until the batter is smooth.
Next, drop the fish fillets into the batter. Ensure they are evenly coated, but allow the excess to drip off (if there’s too much batter on the fish, you’ll end up with dough balls!). Carefully place the fish into the oil one piece at a time, ensuring that they don’t stick to each other. Fry in batches so that the fish pieces aren’t overcrowded, frying for 3-4 minutes or until golden brown.
Scoop the fried fish out and transfer to a cooling rack placed over a baking sheet to drain. Repeat until all the fish has been fried.
Next, put two teaspoons of the frying oil in a separate wok or skillet over high heat, and toss in the onions, and peppers. Stir-fry for 30 seconds, and then stir in the ketchup. Fry for another 20 seconds––frying the ketchup brings out the color and makes for a better depth of flavor in the sweet and sour sauce.
Mix in the pineapple, pineapple juice, red wine vinegar, water, salt, and sugar, and bring the liquid to a low simmer for 2 minutes. With the sweet and sour sauce still simmering, slowly stir in the cornstarch slurry until the sauce is thick enough to coat a spoon.
At this point, if the fried fish fillets have softened, you can refry them in the oil heated to 400F for 30 seconds in larger batches. The higher heat is needed because the oil will cool immediately after putting in a larger batch of fish in the oil.
