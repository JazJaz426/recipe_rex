How to Make Soy Milk at Home,Kaitlin,https://thewoksoflife.com/how-to-make-soy-milk/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/how-to-make-soy-milk-6-1.jpg,"['10 ounces soybeans ((285g, soaked overnight))', '12 cups water', '1/8 teaspoon salt', 'Sugar ((to taste, optional))']","First, rinse your soybeans, put in a large bowl, and completely submerge with cold water. Set aside and let soak overnight.
The next day, rinse the soybeans a couple of times and transfer to a large pot. Add 12 cups of water to the beans, and bring to a boil using high heat and continue to cook for 10 more minutes using medium heat.
Next, blend the soybeans and water in batches until completely smooth. We used our Blendtec’s “smoothie” setting. Transfer the blended soybean mixture to another pot and let simmer for 40 minutes. Watch it carefully, as it’s easy for the soymilk to boil over! Towards the end of the 40 minutes, add salt and sugar to taste (if using), stirring to dissolve.
After 40 minutes, strain the soymilk through a fine cheesecloth. It’s ideal to use cheesecloth, which will result in the cleanest and smoothest soy milk, but you can also use a fine-meshed strainer, as we did. If you use a fine-meshed strainer, you’ll want to let your soy milk settle before using it, as there will be some soybean solids at the bottom of whatever bottle or container you use to store it. This is especially important if you’re using the soymilk for coffee. If you’re using it for baking or to make a Chinese dish like Dou Jiang, a few solids are just fine.
Transfer the soymilk to a bottle, jar, or other airtight container and store in the fridge on the top shelf in the back to preserve it for longer! It’s best to finish it as soon as you can--we wouldn’t recommend keeping it for longer than a few days. As with all homemade staples like pickles, tomato sauce, etc. it’s best to exercise caution!",en-US,"{'calories': '133 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '10 g', 'proteinContent': '9 g', 'fatContent': '6 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '1 g', 'sodiumContent': '203 mg', 'fiberContent': '1 g', 'sugarContent': '7 g', 'servingSize': '1 serving'}",4.5,,The Woks of Life,740,8 serving(s)

After it reaches a rolling boil, turn off the heat and let sit for 10 minutes or so. Apparently, Chinese tea gurus say that intensely hot boiled water zaps all the nutrients out of the tea leaves, ergo the short cooling process prior to brewing the tea. (As with most things related to Chinese cooking that my mother says that other people say, I can't really confirm whether or not this is actually true, but better safe than sorry...)
Put the tea in your favorite kettle (or a large mixing bowl), making sure that it's either in a tea bag (you can actually buy these and fill them with your own selection of teas!) or a few metal tea infusers. (If you haven't got any of this equipment, you can also just strain the tea prior to adding the half and half.) Add the hot water and let steep for 15 minutes.
Now you're ready to add the sugar. Mix the tea and sugar thoroughly until the sugar is completely dissolved. Then add the half and half. For anyone who's squeamish about higher fat dairy, it's really not a lot per serving, as this serves four. If you want to sub in regular milk, go right ahead, but the flavor of the finished product is truly authentic with the half and half!
Put the tea in the fridge to chill for at least 1 hour. This is preferred over adding ice, so that the tea doesn't get diluted. Also, more authentic! When your tea is close to the optimal temperature, break out your bubbles. Preparing the bubbles entails boiling them in water; you can follow the package instructions.

Our Phin Vietnamese coffee filters are the 6-ounce size, but they come in different sizes depending upon your brewing needs. Alternatively, you can use a French coffee press or your favorite drip coffee method.
Measure 3 tablespoons of ground coffee, and distribute it evenly into the filter.
DO NOT shake the filters or compress the coffee, or the coffee grounds will drop into the holes of the coffee filter and plug up the holes! The result will be that the coffee takes forever to drip, or the grounds may clog the filter entirely. Place the metal filter gently on top of the coffee.
Pour your desired amount of condensed milk into a mug or heatproof glass.
Measure out 6 ounces of near boiling water. Use 8 ounces if you don’t like your coffee with such a strong kick in the pants.
With the filter placed over the glass, pour two tablespoons of hot water into the filter and wait for 5 seconds to ""bloom"" the coffee. The bloom is the part of the coffee brewing process when the water releases CO2 from the coffee, and the grounds expand.
Next, press on the filter gently to compress the bloomed coffee. This helps slow down the drip rate when you use all of your water, and also makes for a more flavorful coffee.
With these steps, you’ll be able to achieve the optimum brewing time. That said, now slowly pour the rest of the water into the filter, and the coffee will begin dripping into your cup or glass.
Wait about 5 minutes for the coffee to finish drip brewing!
Remove the filter, and stir to mix in the condensed milk.",en-US,"{'calories': '129 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '22 g', 'proteinContent': '3 g', 'fatContent': '3 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '2 g', 'cholesterolContent': '14 mg', 'sodiumContent': '60 mg', 'sugarContent': '22 g', 'servingSize': '1 serving'}",4.5,,The Woks of Life,25,1 serving(s)

Cut the peach in half around the pit, and give it a light twist. Remove and discard the peach pit. We decided not to peel the peaches when we made frozen peach daiquiris for this post, because the skin adds color and also fiber to the drink. Who says it a peach daiquiri can’t be healthy?
If you do want to peel the peaches, when they are in season and ripe, you may be able to peel them by hand without blanching the skin or using a peeler. If you decide not to peel the peach, make sure you give the skin a good scrubbing to remove pesticides. Note that if you’re having a party, you can prepare a batch of halved peaches and keep them in the refrigerator or freeze them in advance.
Place the halved peaches in a blender along with the agave syrup and lime juice. You can squeeze the lime juice ahead of time but always use fresh lime juice for the best tasting daiquiri.

Add the all-purpose flour to the bowl of an electric mixer. With the mixer on low, slowly add the water. Run the mixer until the dough comes together into a smooth ball. 2 cups of water is a baseline. You may need less water in humid climates and more in drier climates/times of year (i.e. winter).
The finished dough should be soft and pliable, but not wet or sticky. Cover with an overturned bowl or plate, and let the dough rest on the counter for 1 hour. This gives the flour more time to absorb moisture, which will make the dough smoother and easier to work with. While the dough is resting, make the filling.
Take a spoon and scrape the fish meat a little bit at a time, discarding the tough membrane that’s left behind. Coarsely chop the fish (no need to make it into a paste-like texture at this stage). Add the fish to a large mixing bowl along with the rest of the filling ingredients. Whip in one direction using chopsticks or a wooden spoon for a good 5 minutes until the filling becomes gooey and sticky. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for 15 minutes.
Now we are ready to assemble the dumplings! When the dough is done resting, cut it into eighths. Take one of your smaller pieces of dough, keeping the rest of the pieces covered to prevent them from drying out. Roll the small piece of dough into a thick cylinder on a clean and lightly floured surface. Cut the cylinder into 10-gram pieces using a kitchen scale. Now take one piece, and roll it from edge to center with a small rolling pin as you turn the dough in a circular motion. The end result is a 3-inch diameter dumpling wrapper that has thinner edges and a slightly thicker center.
Add about a tablespoon of filling to the center, and fold the wrapper in half. Position the dumpling so that each side is held in place by your thumb and index finger (this is a two-handed operation). Then with gentle pressure, press the two sides of the wrappers closed tightly. At the same time, press the filling slightly downward, by bringing your wrists slightly closer. Practice will make perfect! Place the dumplings on a sheet pan lined with parchment paper.
Before you go too far down the road of making the dumplings, now is a good time to pause for a taste test. Boil a small pot of water just as you’re beginning to assemble the dumplings, and cook 2-3 test dumplings according to the cooking instructions below. Taste and adjust the seasoning accordingly before proceeding with the rest of the batch! You may want more Shaoxing wine, more vinegar, more ginger, or more soy sauce, for example.
Before cooking the dumplings, assemble the dipping sauce by combining all the sauce ingredients in a small bowl.
To cook the dumplings, make sure to cook them in small batches, since the filling is somewhat wet and the dumplings will loose their shape when left sitting for too long.
Fill a large soup pot halfway with water. Bring it to a boil. Add the dumplings, stirring the water slowly as you add them to prevent them from sticking to each other. Keep the pot uncovered.
Bring the water to a boil again, and then add 1 additional cup of cold water to stop the boiling process. As the pot of water continues to rise in temperature, repeat this previous step 3 until the dumplings are floating to the surface. The dumplings are cooked once the water has boiled after three instances of adding cold water. Scoop them out with a strainer or slotted spoon, and enjoy them right away with the dipping sauce.
