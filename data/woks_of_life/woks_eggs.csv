Ji Dan Bing: The Chinese Breakfast of Champions,Bill,https://thewoksoflife.com/chinese-breakfast-jidan-bing/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/chinese-breakfast-jidan-bing-18-1.jpg,"['1¼ cups all-purpose flour ((170 grams))', '1/8 teaspoon salt', '½ cup warm water', 'vegetable oil', '4 eggs', 'Sweet bean sauce', 'Hot chili bean sauce', 'Hot chili oil', 'Toasted sesame seeds', '2 scallions ((finely chopped))', '1 handful cilantro ((finely chopped, optional))', '4 leaves romaine lettuce ((washed and dried))']","Mix together the flour, salt, and ½ cup of warm water with a rubber spatula until a sticky dough forms--about 2-3 minutes. The dough should be sticky, but should also come together in a ball. Coat the dough with 1 teaspoon of vegetable oil and cover with plastic wrap so it is completely sealed. Allow to rest for 1 hour.
After the dough has rested, ready the other ingredients--this will be the filling of the Ji Dan Bing. Next, divide the dough into four equal portions, drizzling additional vegetable oil on the dough and your hands to prevent it from sticking. The dough will be less sticky after resting, but it should still be quite moist.
Next, lightly coat your rolling surface and rolling pin with oil, but if you feel things sticking. Most street vendors use a stainless steel surface like you see in the video, but a marble or granite countertop or wooden cutting board will also work nicely.
Use a standard non-tapered rolling pin for this recipe, and roll the dough out into a thin layer until it is almost translucent.
Heat a large skillet or frying pan over medium-high heat. Add 1 teaspoon of oil, which should thin out and spread out easily on the skillet when it is added. The skillet should not be smoking, however!
Lift the rolled out dough in one steady motion and place it in the pan, doing your best to lay it down in one even layer. The dough should sizzle in the skillet to indicate that your pan is hot enough.
Immediately crack one egg in the center of the dough. Lightly beat the egg with a few strokes using a fork or your spatula, spreading it across the dough. There is no need to meticulously try to cover the entire area of the dough, and don’t worry if the egg overflows either. The dough and egg will become one!
Drizzle another teaspoon of oil on top of your Ji Dan Bing. Flip it, and let the egg side cook for about 10 seconds, then flip it again. Let the Ji Dan Bing cook for another minute, or until parts of it are golden brown, and transfer to a cutting board or plate, egg side up.
Spread any combination of sweet bean, hot bean sauce, and hot chili oil on the Ji Dan Bing. Sprinkle toasted sesame seeds on top, along with scallions and cilantro--if using. Place a large leaf of romaine lettuce on top, roll up the pancake, and enjoy while it’s piping hot!",en-US,{},4.88,,The Woks of Life,85,4 serving(s)

Lotus Mooncakes with Salted Egg Yolks,Judy,https://thewoksoflife.com/lotus-mooncakes-egg-yolks/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/lotus-mooncakes-32.jpg,"['8 ounces granulated sugar ((1 cup plus 2 tablespoons, 225g))', '½ cup water ((120 ml))', 'Juice of ½ a lemon', '12 ounces dried lotus seeds ((340g, pre-halved is ideal if you can find it; we used whole))', '4 cups water ((950 ml))', ""1⅔ cups powdered sugar ((210g, aka icing sugar or confectioner's sugar))"", '1¼ cups peanut oil or corn oil ((300 ml))', '12 salted duck egg yolks', '140 ml sugar syrup (that you made or bought)', '⅓ cup peanut oil or corn oil ((80 ml))', '1 teaspoon lye water ((available at your Chinese grocery store))', '1 ⅔ cups flour ((about 250g, plus more for dusting))', '1 egg yolk', '3 tablespoons water']","Making the Syrup: Heat the sugar and water in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir to dissolve the sugar. Once it’s boiled, add the lemon juice, stir, and immediately turn the heat down to low. Keep the lid off, and let the syrup simmer for about 60 to 70 minutes until the sugary liquid turns a light amber color. Do not stir during this time frame! By now, the liquid might look too watery, but it will thicken once it’s cooled. Try not to overcook it, because it will become thick like caramel (it should be the consistency of honey). Just in case you do overcook the syrup, and it’s too thick, add a few drops of hot water to thin it out. Keep adding the hot water until you get the right consistency. Now pour the sugary liquid into a heatproof container, and let it cool completely before storing it in the refrigerator.
Making the Lotus Paste: Using a butter knife, gently split the lotus seeds in half through the top opening. Remove and discard the green center. Wash and soak them overnight. The next day, wash and drain the lotus seeds. In a pot, add the lotus seeds and 4 cups of water (the water level should be above the lotus seeds). Bring the mixture to a boil over high heat. Once the water reaches a boil, turn the heat to low, and let the seeds simmer for 30 minutes. It’s done once the lotus seeds are softened but have maintained their shape. Turn off the heat, let cool, and then drain the liquid. In a food processor, puree the cooked lotus seeds (it’s best to do this in two batches). Transfer the lotus puree to a non-stick pan (or a cast-iron pan, or a pan with a thick bottom to avoid sticking and burning). Turn the heat to medium low, and stir/flip/turn the puree using a rubber spatula non-stop for about 30 minutes (nice to have the TV or an audiobook on as you're doing this). In between, add in the powdered sugar and oil in 3 alternating batches. With each batch, make sure the sugar and oil is well incorporated before adding more. The lotus filling is done once the lotus paste is slightly firmer/can hold its shape. Let it cool completely before storing in the refrigerator in an airtight container. You can make this one day ahead of time, and I found that it’s easier to work with when the filling has been chilled.
Making the salted duck egg yolks: There are a couple of ways to go about preparing the salted duck egg yolk: The ones I bought are already cooked, so they were ready to use, and you can buy the same. But I did find them to be slightly drier than I would normally like. You can also buy whole cooked salted duck eggs, and extract the whole yolk. You can buy raw salted duck eggs, crack the eggs open, and take out the yolks. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Dip each yolk in baijiu (白酒, a clear Chinese liquor made from grain), just briefly to coat it, then put the egg yolks on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake for 8 minutes, let them cool completely, and they are ready to use. You can also prepare this ahead of time...just make sure to store them in an airtight container and in the fridge.
Making the dough: First mix the sugar syrup, oil, and lye water together. Then add the mixture to the flour, and use a rubber spatula to fold and combine everything into a soft dough. Do not overwork the dough--this step should only take about a minute or two. Cover the dough in an airtight container or wrap in plastic wrap. Let it rest in the refrigerator for an hour. Chilled dough is much easier to work with. (Side note: you may also leave the dough in the refrigerator overnight if you'd like to make it ahead of time.)
Assembling the mooncakes: While the dough is resting, let’s start assembling the filling. My mooncake mold was marked 100 grams, which means each mooncake should weigh about 100 grams after assembly. This recipe makes 18 mooncakes total: 12 mooncakes with salted duck egg yolks and 6 mooncakes without. Separately weigh out twelve 58-gram scoops of lotus filling and six 70-gram scoops of lotus filling. Shape each portion of filling into balls. Next, take one of the 58 gram lotus balls, make a deep well in the middle, and insert one salted duck egg yolk into the middle. Then close the top and re-shape it into a ball. Repeat for the remaining 11 pieces. It’s good to separate the “with” and the “without.” It’s also a good idea to put them back into the refrigerator, covered, until you are ready to assemble the rest of the mooncakes. Once the dough has finished resting, it’s time to prepare the mooncake mold. My mooncake mold came with four pattern plates––one plate should be attached to the mold itself. Wrap another one with clear plastic, because we will use it to press the mooncake from the bottom;, Now dust the inside of the mold with plenty of flour and shake off the excess. You’ll need to repeat this process before pressing every mooncake to avoid sticking. Divide and weigh the dough into eighteen 25-gram pieces, plus 1 smaller dough ball for scraps/mending, which I will get to. Shape each piece into a ball. Lightly dust the dough balls with flour. Take one dough ball and roll it out on a lightly floured surface into a 4-inch round. Put one piece of filling in the center. Carefully lift it up and turn it upside down, and gently press out the air bubbles around the lotus ball, without breaking the dough. Now turn the opening facing up, and slowly press the dough together to close the opening, keeping the distribution of the dough as even as possible. The dough feels like Play-doh, so it’s easy to break, but it’s also easy to squish back together. These instructions might sound confusing, but follow along with the pictures and keep in mind that the chief goal here is to close the dough around the filling without capturing air inside. Now lightly dust the assembled ball with additional flour. Place it inside the mooncake mold with the mold opening facing up. Now press in the bottom piece (with the clear plastic-wrapped plate that you prepared). With some pressure, gently press it inward. Quickly sit the mold down, and press the mooncake out with the top pressure bar. The bottom piece will come out no problem, but use your other hand to VERY GENTLY guide the mooncake out of the mold. When and if a small piece of dough gets stuck and does not come out, get a small piece of the “scrap”/“mending” dough to patch up the area. Then clean the mold and dust it well with flour again. Then gently flatten all sides of the mooncake to make it smaller, so it can go back in the mooncake mold for re-shaping. Use slightly more flour for dusting if this becomes a persistent issue. Place the mooncakes on a baking sheet as you make them.
Baking the mooncakes: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees when you are almost finished assembling the mooncakes. Once the oven is preheated, gently mist the mooncakes with a food-grade spray bottle (if you have one) filled with water. But since I didn’t have one, I just used my fingers, and it worked fine! Dip your fingers into a bowl of water, and fling the water on your fingers onto the mooncakes a couple of times. This prevents the dough from cracking. Then, immediately put the mooncakes in the oven and bake for 5 minutes. (Remember to set the timer!) Now prepare the egg wash by whisking the egg yolk and water together. After the mooncakes have been baking for 5 minutes, take them out of the oven and immediately lower the oven temperature to 300 degrees. Now lightly brush each mooncake with egg wash, and put them back in the oven. Bake them for another 15 minutes and remember to set the timer. When the time has elapsed, take them out and let them cool completely.
When the mooncakes first come out of the oven, the dough looks dry like bread, and not oily like what you are used to when opening packaged mooncakes. This is normal. Store the cooled mooncakes in an airtight container for a day or two, and the outside will get that nice shiny sheen that you recognize and love.
After this last step, any uneaten mooncakes can be kept in the refrigerator for a week or two.",en-US,"{'calories': '308 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '51 g', 'proteinContent': '6 g', 'fatContent': '9 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '2 g', 'cholesterolContent': '141 mg', 'sodiumContent': '16 mg', 'fiberContent': '1 g', 'sugarContent': '29 g', 'servingSize': '1 serving'}",4.85,,The Woks of Life,840,18 serving(s)

Add ¼ cup oil to the wok and heat over medium-high heat. Add the ginger and fry until fragrant (the color will darken, but the ginger will not necessarily become crisp). Next, add the garlic. It should be lightly toasted; if it’s still white in color, it needs more cooking time. In total, it will take about 10 minutes time to cook the ginger and garlic.
Next, turn the heat up to high and add the rice to the wok. Stir-fry the rice so the ginger/garlic mixture is evenly distributed. Spread the rice out in one layer so it can evenly toast. Occasionally stir-fry the rice and re-spread it. Next, season the rice with the soy sauce, Shaoxing wine, and white pepper. Continue to stir-fry for another 3-5 minutes.
Next, pour the eggs evenly over the rice, and stir-fry quickly to distribute. The egg will coat the grains of rice, and you’ll have egg throughout instead of large clumps. If you’d prefer to pre-scramble the eggs and then stir them in at this step, you can do that too.

This is a simple dish, but things move quickly once the heat is on, so be prepared. Pour the oil into a nonstick pan over medium heat. Place the frozen pancake into the pan and let cook for about 15 seconds then flip over. This makes it so that both sides of the pancake pick up an equal amount of the oil right away, and you don’t have to unnecessarily add more.
Having an ancient yellow Labrador hogging the space around the oven is totally optional.
Cook the pancake until it starts to get nice and golden. Cook it a little longer on one side so it’s fully golden brown.
Lift the pancake with a spatula or chopsticks and pour the egg into the pan. Swirl the egg around the pan evenly and then place the pancake back in the pan with the more cooked side hitting the egg. Let it cook for another 30 seconds or so.
Flip the pancake so the egg side is facing up. Take your spicy bean sauce and spread it over the egg evenly with a spoon. Then sprinkle the cilantro and scallion evenly over the top. By this time, the bottom of your pancake should be nice and browned.
Finally, turn off the heat and transfer the pancake to a cutting board.

This will give the soup that rich restaurant-style yellow color, but it is optional. Taste the soup, and adjust the seasoning if needed.
Next add the cornstarch and water mixture. Make sure the cornstarch and water is mixed well, as the cornstarch settles very quickly. Stir the soup continuously as you drizzle in the slurry, or you'll get clumps of cooked starch in your soup. Use more or less starch if you like a thicker or thinner soup. You can also add the starch in a couple small batches, let the soup simmer for a couple of minutes, then check to see if the consistency is to your liking.
Now we're ready for the most exciting part: the egg. This recipe calls for the egg to be lightly beaten, which results in both white and yellow egg swirls. The speed at which you stir the soup when adding the egg also determines whether you get large “egg flowers” or small egg flowers (i.e. swirly bits of egg).

Salted Duck Eggs,Judy,https://thewoksoflife.com/salted-duck-eggs/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/homemade-salted-duck-eggs-6.jpg,"['12 duck eggs', '1 quart water ((about 1 L, depending on the size of your container and the size of your eggs))', '1/4 cup sea salt ((70g))', '1/2 cup baijiu ((120ml, 55 proof Chinese hard liquor; can substitute whiskey))']","First, wash the eggs in plain water until clean.
Carefully arrange the eggs in the container they’ll be brined in. Add enough water to cover the eggs so they are completely submerged. This step is to find out how much water you need, so do not discard the water.
Carefully remove the eggs from the water, and let them sunbathe for 3-4 hours in the early morning sun; reduce the sunbathing time to 1-2 hours if the temperature is higher than 65F, but it should still be early morning sun! Turn the eggs every hour. The late morning hot sun may result in cracked eggs during the salting process.
Meanwhile, transfer the water in the container to a clean pot—I used about 1 quart of water (if you’re using aromatics, it’s time to add them now!). Stir in ¼ cup salt and bring to a boil.

Pour ½ cup of Chinese baijiu (or whiskey) into a large bowl, carefully take the eggs, and turn them over in the baijiu. ½ cup of baijiu isn’t enough to submerge them, so you’ll have to roll them around every 10 minutes so they are soaking at all times. Soak the eggs in the baijiu for 1 hour.
Once the salt water is completely cooled and your container is dry, add the eggs back to the glass container one by one. Pour in the baijiu used to soak the eggs along with the cooled salt water. Arrange the eggs with a clean utensil to make sure they are all completely submerged.
Cover tightly so that the container is thoroughly sealed, and store in a cool, dry place for 30 to 60 days. Egg sizes vary, so brining time will vary as well. You can cook one after 30 days to see if it’s done. Try again in 10-15 days if it's not quite there!

Bring another pot of water to a boil for the eggs. Once boiling, gently and quickly lower the eggs into the boiling water using a large spoon. You want to avoid dropping them and cracking them on the bottom of the pot. Let the eggs cook in the boiling water for 7 minutes (it’s a good idea to set a timer). Once the timer goes off, turn off the heat, quickly scoop out the eggs, and transfer to an ice bath. Allow them to sit in the ice bath until they are completely cool to the touch. The purpose here is to stop cooking the eggs any further.
Once the eggs are cooled, lightly crack the egg shells. The goal here is to make enough cracks to allow the flavor of the sauce base to seep into the egg. I like to use a small spoon to tap the eggs, but be careful! It you tap or crack too hard, you might crack open the egg since the egg yolk is still very soft.
Soak the cracked eggs in your sauce base for 24 hours in the refrigerator, making sure all the eggs are completely submerged in the sauce base. After 24 hours, they’re ready!

Add the scallions and toasted sesame seeds to the batter, and mix until evenly distributed. Let the batter sit for 5 minutes.
Heat your waffle iron to the highest setting, and once it’s hot, pour enough batter in to cover. Most waffle irons are non-stick and do not require any additional oil, but if you have an old cast iron one, you can brush the iron with some oil or melted butter, especially if you want an extra crispy waffle.
How much batter you use for each sesame scallion waffle and the length of time the waffle needs to cook depends upon the waffle iron you are using, but you will know what to do after you make the first one. Most Belgian waffle makers can accommodate about ¾ cup of batter per waffle and will take 6 minutes to cook up a brown and crispy waffle. When the steam subsides, you can be pretty confident that your waffle is done.
If you have a waffle iron that flips, flip it once after you have poured in the batter and once more halfway through the cooking – or about 3 minutes. Check your waffle after 6 minutes and let it cook longer if you like your waffles darker and crunchier. Flipping helps to release the steam from the batter makes your sesame scallion waffles crispier. You can make adjustments as needed according to your setup!
Take the waffle out of the iron when done, taking care not to burn yourself because they are really hot.

Add the butter and break it up roughly with your fingers, making sure to keep visible little chunks of butter in the dough. Add 2 tablespoons of cold water and bring the dough together. Add a tiny bit more water if necessary, but not too much. Cover the dough and refrigerate for 20 minutes.
Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured board, knead gently, and form into a neat rectangle. Roll the dough away from you (not back and forth), forming a 20 x 50cm rectangle (about 8x20 inches). Try to keep the edges even, and don’t overwork the butter streaks. Flecks of butter should still be visible in the dough.
Fold the top third of the dough down to the center, then the bottom third up and over that. Give the dough a quarter turn (left or right) and roll out again to three times the length. Fold the same way as before, cover, and chill for 30 minutes.
While the dough is resting, make the filling. Dissolve 1/2 cup sugar into the cup of hot water, and allow to cool to room temperature.

Add 1 teaspoon soy sauce and 1 teaspoon cornstarch until well combined, and set aside.
Next, make the gravy. In a medium pot or saucepan, heat 1 tablespoon of oil over medium heat. Add 1 tablespoon of flour to make a roux, and cook for 15-20 seconds. Stir in the turmeric, paprika, garlic powder, and onion powder. Let fry for 15 seconds, and whisk in the chicken stock.
Bring the mixture to a simmer, and add the soy sauce, oyster sauce, sesame oil, and freshly ground white pepper to taste. The gravy should be slightly thickened from the roux. Mix the cornstarch with the ¼ cup of chicken stock or water to make a slurry (i.e. until the cornstarch is completely dissolved), and slowly stir in two-thirds of the mixture. Let cook for 30 seconds. Add more of the cornstarch slurry if necessary, until the gravy is thick enough to coat a spoon. Add salt or more soy sauce to your own taste. Be careful not to over-salt the gravy. Cover and set aside.
Next, sear the chicken. Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in your wok until it just starts to smoke, and add in the marinated chicken cubes. Sear for 1 minute on each side, and then stir-fry for another minute until just cooked through. Transfer back to the marinating bowl, and set aside to cool.
In a wok or deep pot, pre-heat your 6 cups of frying oil to 350F. Use a candy thermometer to check the temperature––too high a temperature will result in burned Egg Foo Young patties, and too low a temperature will give you greasy patties or will make your patties fall apart!
Meanwhile, place the cooled chicken, diced onion, and bean sprouts into a mixing bowl. Add the eggs, sesame oil, and second teaspoon of cornstarch. Do not add any salt or seasonings to this mixture, or your Egg Foo Young patties may not hold together when frying!
Use a large soup ladle or hoak (a Chinese ladle that’s often used together with a Chinese spatula) to fold the mixture together until just combined. The eggs should look like they are slightly beaten and only just mixed with the rest of the ingredients. If you over-mix the eggs, the whole mixture will become too watery and will not form a patty during frying.
Using your ladle, work quickly to slowly drop three separate scoops of the mixture into the wok for the first batch (you can also work in batches of 2 if your wok is smaller). Each scoop should be about 3/4 cup of the mixture. The correct technique is to tilt your ladle close to the oil, and pour the mixture starting from the edge where the oil meets the wok. Pour it slowly so the ladle barely touches the oil. Don’t let the egg cook while it’s in the ladle, or it will stick to the ladle, and you won’t have a smooth drop for the next Egg Foo Young patty.
Let the patties fry for about 40 seconds. You can also use your wok spatula to gently flip some hot oil on top of the uncooked patty to speed the cooking time. When each patty is solid and turning golden brown, use your wok spatula to turn them over in the same order that you dropped them into the oil.
After another 60 seconds, scoop each patty onto a mesh strainer, giving it a few gentle taps to remove excess oil. Place each patty on a wire rack over a sheet pan to drain until all of your patties are cooked.
Transfer the Egg Foo Young patties from the cooling rack to a serving plate (ideally these are served individually, rather than on a big family-style platter), pour the gravy over the top, add a sprinkling of scallions and toasted sesame seeds, and serve with additional gravy on the side.",en-US,"{'calories': '420 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '20 g', 'proteinContent': '28 g', 'fatContent': '26 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '11 g', 'cholesterolContent': '299 mg', 'sodiumContent': '455 mg', 'fiberContent': '2 g', 'sugarContent': '4 g', 'servingSize': '1 serving'}",4.99,,The Woks of Life,50,4 serving(s)

Add the peas and stir fry continuously for another minute. Next spread the salt, sugar, and black pepper over the rice and mix. You should now see some steam coming off the rice, which means it is heated through.
If the rice looks a little dry, feel free to sprinkle in some water or chicken stock. Adding some liquid directly to any remaining clumps of rice will also help to break them up. Mix in the scrambled eggs and scallions and serve!",en-US,"{'calories': '308 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '42 g', 'proteinContent': '9 g', 'fatContent': '11 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '2 g', 'cholesterolContent': '136 mg', 'sodiumContent': '637 mg', 'fiberContent': '2 g', 'sugarContent': '2 g', 'servingSize': '1 serving'}",4.78,,The Woks of Life,25,6 serving(s)
