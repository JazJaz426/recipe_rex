Combine the cumin, cayenne, garlic powder, salt, black pepper, and Sichuan pepper powder, if using, and rub it all over the lamb. Set aside to marinate in the fridge while you assemble the buns.
To make the buns, start by dissolving the sugar in the hot water in a medium bowl. Once the water has cooled slightly (it should be warm, but not hot), stir in the yeast until dissolved and let stand for ten minutes. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
Once the yeast mixture is foamy, whisk in the milk and yogurt. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix it all together to form a dough. Knead until the dough comes together into a soft, slightly sticky ball (add a little more flour if necessary, but the dough should still be relatively sticky). Cover with a damp towel and let rise in a warm place for 1 hour.
Roll the dough out until it’s about an eighth of an inch thick (it will puff up quite a bit while cooking). Cut circles in the dough (about 4 inches in diameter. We just used a small rice bowl to cut out the circles). Continue to re-roll and cut more circles until all the dough is used up. Brush one side with butter and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Leave the dough circles on a floured board and cover with a damp towel.
Now heat a cast iron pan or skillet until almost smoking. Add 2 tablespoons oil and sear the lamb on all sides, until you get a nice, dark crust on the outside of the meat. Lower the heat to medium and continue cooking for another 7-12 minutes until it reaches your desired doneness. Set the meat aside on a plate to rest.
While that’s happening, make the drizzle by heating a tablespoon of oil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add the honey, vinegar, and soy sauce and allow it to bubble until it becomes syrupy. Set aside.
Now, cook your buns (this doesn’t take long at all!). Heat a pan over medium heat and brush the pan lightly with melted butter. Add the dough circles to the pan, sesame side facing up. Cook for 1-2 minutes and flip. Cook for another 1-2 minutes on the other side and take out of the pan.
To assemble, grab one of your buns, add some sliced lamb, carrot, scallions, mint, cilantro, and a drizzle of sauce.",en-US,"{'calories': '375 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '41 g', 'proteinContent': '19 g', 'fatContent': '15 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '5 g', 'cholesterolContent': '51 mg', 'sodiumContent': '441 mg', 'fiberContent': '2 g', 'sugarContent': '6 g', 'servingSize': '1 serving'}",5.0,,The Woks of Life,150,6 serving(s)
Xinjiang Lamb Rice,Judy,https://thewoksoflife.com/lamb-rice/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/lamb-rice-12.jpg,"['2 cups uncooked white rice', '2 pounds fatty lamb ((900g, cut into 1/2 inch chunks, separate out the fatty pieces from the lean meat))', '4 cups water', '3 slices ginger', '3 tablespoons oil', '1 medium onion ((diced))', '2 teaspoons salt', '2 teaspoons soy sauce', '1 teaspoon cumin powder', '1 pound carrots ((cut into thin strips))', '¼ cup raisins ((optional))']","Soak the rice for 30 minutes. Drain and set aside.
While the rice is soaking, blanch the lamb by boiling 4 cups of water in a pot along with the lamb and ginger. Let it boil for a couple of minutes, and then turn off the heat. Use a slotted spoon to pick out the lamb pieces and set them aside, making sure to drain off any excess water. Then use a fine mesh strainer to strain the cooking liquid. Reserve that liquid to cook the rice.
Now heat the oil in a wok over high heat. Add ONLY the fatty lamb pieces, and stir-fry to get a nice crust on them. Turn the heat down to medium low, and render the fat until the pieces start to turn golden brown, about 6 to 8 minutes.
Turn the heat to medium, and add the onion. Cook until the onion is translucent. Now turn the heat back up to high and add the blanched lamb in a single layer so as to brown the meat on all sides. This will take a few minutes. Add 2 1/2 cups of the cooking liquid you reserved earlier, along with the salt, soy sauce, and cumin, and mix everything well. Cover and simmer for 20 minutes.
Now add in the carrots and raisins (if using), and cover for another minute to bring the mixture back up to a boil. Turn off the heat. (Don’t worry, the carrots will finish cooking in the rice cooker. Also, at this point, the taste will be on the salty side, but remember that it will mellow up once mixed in with the rice.)
Pour everything into the rice cooker (or a pot), and add the rice. The rice should be spread out evenly. There should be enough liquid to see peeking through the rice grains (you may need to add more water if needed), but the liquid level should not be above the rice. Cover and start the rice cooker. If you are using a pot, turn the heat up to medium high to bring the mixture to a simmer, cover, turn the heat down to low, and cook for 15-20 minutes.

Spicy Cumin Lamb Biang Biang Noodles,Sarah,https://thewoksoflife.com/cumin-lamb-biang-biang-noodles/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/biang-biang-noodles-22-1.jpg,"['1 1/2 cups bread flour', '1/4 teaspoon salt', '1/2 cup ((plus 1 tablespoon water))', '8 oz. fatty lamb shoulder or chuck ((225g, thinly sliced))', '1 tablespoon vegetable oil ((plus 3 tablespoons, divided))', '1 tablespoon rice wine ((plus 2 tablespoons, divided))', '1 teaspoon cornstarch', '1 1/2 tablespoons cumin seeds', '2 teaspoons coriander seeds', '1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper', '1 tablespoon grated ginger', '2 scallions ((chopped, white parts and green parts separated))', '7 cloves garlic ((minced))', '1 long hot red or green chili pepper ((de-seeded and thinly sliced))', '3 tablespoons chili oil ((preferably homemade))', '1 teaspoon sugar', '1 teaspoon black vinegar or rice vinegar', '1 tablespoon soy sauce', '1/2 teaspoon salt', '1 small red onion ((thinly sliced))', '1/2 cup finely diced Chinese celery or regular celery ((optional))', '3 cabbage leaves ((roughly chopped))', '1/2 cup garlic chives ((roughly chopped, optional))']","First, make the noodle dough. In the bowl of a stand mixer, add the bread flour, salt and water. Combine the mixture with your hands or a fork until it starts to form a scraggly dough. Once the dough has come together a bit, attach the bowl to the mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment, and turn it on low speed (setting “2” on a KitchenAid). Allow the mixer to knead the dough for 20 minutes. By the end, the dough will have formed a ball that: doesn’t stick to the sides of the bowl, is smooth and elastic, and isn’t too dry.
You’ll know the dough is done when you can rip off a piece of it and stretch it slowly by a couple inches without it breaking apart. If the dough breaks, knead for another 3-5 minutes (to allow the dough to absorb more moisture). If it still won’t stretch, try adding a tablespoon of water and kneading by hand to incorporate the water. Then transfer it to the mixer once again and allow the dough hook to do its work for another 5 minutes. You need to give the dough time to absorb the moisture uniformly.
If, on the other hand, your kitchen is humid and the dough is a bit sticky, sprinkle in some more flour and knead for another 3-5 minutes.
Once the dough has reached the right consistency, cover it with plastic wrap or an overturned bowl (as long as the bowl is not touching the dough) and allow it to rest for 1 to 2 hours.
Now, get the rest of your ingredients ready. Combine the sliced lamb with 1 tablespoon vegetable oil, 1 tablespoon rice wine, and 1 teaspoon cornstarch. Set aside to marinate.
In a clean, dry pan over medium heat, add the cumin seeds, coriander seeds, and white pepper. Toast the spices until fragrant, about 5 minutes. Coarsely grind the spices in a spice grinder or mortar & pestle. Set aside. Prepare all your vegetables, and set those aside as well.
Now you’re ready to make the noodles. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper, and transfer the rested dough to a clean, oiled surface. Press the dough into a half-inch thick, relatively even rectangle about 10 inches in length. Cut the rectangle into 10 equal strips. Take each strip and lay flat on the counter. Use your palm to flatten the strip into a long, wide, flat noodle––don’t worry about it being perfectly straight or even.
Now, the next step is how this noodle got its name. Pick up the noodle on both ends, lift it, and gently slap it repeatedly on the counter while stretching it out. You can also use your hands to flatten it out further so that the noodle has a relatively uniform thickness. The noodles should be about the thickness of spaghetti––if they are translucent at all, they’re too thin. Lay them onto your parchment-lined baking sheet, and repeat the process until you have all 10 noodles. If you run out of space on the parchment paper, just put another layer of parchment on top. You can keep the noodles this thick, or if you like thinner ones, you can slice each noodle in half lengthwise using a sharp knife. Cover the noodles with plastic wrap so they don’t dry out.
Bring a large pot of water to a boil. The noodles will take approximately 90 seconds to cook, so make sure you time it right so that they’re cooked and drained around the same time that your sauce is done.
To make the sauce, heat 3 tablespoons of vegetable oil in a large wok over medium heat. Add the ginger and scallion whites and cook for 1 minute. Add the garlic and chili pepper, and cook for another 30 seconds. Crank up the heat to high and add the marinated lamb. Stir-fry the lamb until just browned, and immediately add 2 tablespoons rice wine, along with your prepared spice mixture, the chili oil, sugar, vinegar, soy sauce, salt, onions, and celery (if using). If things are starting to stick to the bottom of the wok, add a ¼ cup or so of water to deglaze it.
While that’s going, throw your noodles and the cabbage into boiling water, and cook for 90 seconds to 2 minutes.
Transfer the cooked noodles and cabbage to the wok along with the garlic chives and scallion greens, and toss until everything is completely coated in the sauce.
