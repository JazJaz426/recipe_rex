In a skillet over medium high heat, add 2 tablespoons oil and brown the ground meat. Add the onion and garlic, and cook until translucent. Add the tomato sauce, raisins, pecans, smoked paprika, chili powder, cinnamon, and salt.
Let cool as you prepare the other items. Once cooled, mix in the shredded cheese.
Prepare the peppers and salsa:
Broil the peppers and onion on a sheet pan, with the broiler on high, until they are blackened on one side. Flip and broil until entirely charred. Watch them closely! Set them aside, covered with a clean kitchen towel, to loosen the skins.
Blend the charred onion, tomatoes, serrano chilies, garlic, and cilantro. Process the salsa to your preferred consistency—it can be very smooth or a little chunky.
Heat a skillet with 1 tablespoon oil over high heat. Add the salsa to the pan and simmer. Season to taste with salt and pepper and cook until it has reduced a bit and the salsa’s color has changed from light pink to red-orange.
Now use a paper towel or clean kitchen cloth to gently remove the skins from the poblano peppers. Slice an opening lengthwise on each pepper, leaving the rest of the pepper intact. Remove the excess inner membranes and seeds (it doesn’t have to be perfect).
Gently stuff each pepper with filling, sealing the seam with toothpicks.
Fry and serve:
Heat your frying oil to 375 degrees F/190 degrees C
Beat the egg whites with an electric mixer on high speed until soft peaks form. With the mixer running on medium, add the egg yolks one at a time, and beat for 3 more minutes.
When the batter is smooth, light, and fluffy, and coats the back of a wooden spoon without dripping, it is ready to use.
Dredge the peppers in flour, then dip in the batter. Carefully place the pepper in the hot oil. When the bottom of the chile is golden brown, carefully turn it over with a spatula, without damaging the batter. Fry until golden brown.
You can fry 1-2 peppers at a time depending on the size of your skillet, but it’s best not to crowd the pan, so you can easily flip them without damaging the batter. We fried one pepper at a time.

Toss in the cauliflower and fold together until the cauliflower is well coated. Sprinkle the remaining ¼ cup of rice flour over the cauliflower, and stir until everything is sticking to the cauliflower. There should be no more batter at the bottom of the bowl. If there is, just add a little bit more rice flour. If the batter looks dry or crumbly add a teaspoon or two of water.

Steamed Vegetable Buns,Judy,https://thewoksoflife.com/steamed-vegetable-buns/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/vegetable-buns-11-1.jpg,"['1 pound baby bok choy ((450g, washed thoroughly))', '8 fresh shiitake mushrooms', '3 tablespoons vegetable oil ((divided))', '4 ounces dried bean curd ((115g))', '1 teaspoon light soy sauce', '½ teaspoon sugar', '½ tablespoon sesame oil', '⅛ teaspoon ground white pepper', 'Salt ((to taste, in this case, it’s ok to taste the filling as you’re mixing it, because everything is cooked))', '¾ cup warm water', '1 teaspoon instant yeast ((3 grams))', '1 tablespoon sugar ((granulated, 15 grams))', '1 tablespoon vegetable oil ((plus 1 teaspoon, divided))', '2 cups all-purpose flour ((300 grams))', '2 tablespoons cornstarch ((20 grams))', '¼ teaspoon salt', '⅛ teaspoon baking soda']","Making the filling
Prepare a pot of boiling water and an ice bath. Once the pot of water is boiling, blanch the bok choy for a quick 10 seconds in two separate batches. With each batch, the water should be at a rolling boil before you add the bok choy. With a large slotted spoon, scoop out the blanched bok choy and immediately transfer to the ice bath to stop the cooking process.
Strain the bok choy once it’s cooled completely in the ice bath. Do your best to squeeze out as much water as you can. This step is very important for preventing soggy buns!
Next, finely chop the bok choy; a food processor is a great time-saver. Transfer to a mixing bowl. Chop the mushrooms finely. Cook them in a wok over medium heat with 2 tablespoons of oil for about 3 to 4 minutes, until they become fragrant. Cool completely.
Next, finely chop the dried bean curd and set aside.
To finish the filling, first pour off any visible liquid in the bowl of chopped bok choy before adding in the cooked mushrooms and dried bean curd. Next, add 1 tablespoon of oil, the light soy sauce, sugar, sesame oil, and white pepper. Mix well. Salt to taste, and put the filling in the refrigerator to marinate. Chilling also helps to keep the bok choy green.
Making the dough
In a bowl, whisk together the water, yeast, and sugar until the yeast dissolves. Let the mixture sit until the yeast “blooms” and foams (about 15 minutes). Stir in 1 tablespoon of oil, and set aside.
In the meantime, whisk together the flour, cornstarch, salt, and baking soda in a medium bowl. Stir in the yeast mixture using a spatula. After the dry and wet ingredients are incorporated, knead the dough with your hands (or using a mixer) until the dough becomes smooth and soft. If the dough looks sticky, add a bit more flour 1 tablespoon at a time. If the dough feels dry, add a few drops of water at a time, and continue kneading until the dough is smooth and soft. The dough should be soft, but not sticky.
Brush the dough with 1 teaspoon of oil and cover with plastic wrap. Let the dough rest until it doubles in size (about 1 hour). Once the dough has risen, punch it down, and knead it for a few minutes to get rid of all air bubbles. Portion the dough into 14 equal dough balls. Cover with a clean kitchen towel to prevent them from drying out.
Assembling and cooking the buns
Cut 14 pieces of parchment paper into 3”x3” squares, and set aside. On a clean and lightly floured flat surface, take a dough ball, roll it out from edge to center, rotate, and repeat until it forms a 4-inch circle. The center should be slightly thicker than the edges. Your buns need solid footing, after all.
Add about 2½ tablespoons of filling to the center, then pleat and twist the bun repeatedly until the top is closed. Sit the bun on a piece of the prepared parchment paper and place it on the rack of your steaming vessel of choice, with at least 1 cm of clearance on all sides. Repeat until all the buns are assembled.
Check our Chinese cooking tools page for steamer setup options. You could use a steamer rack in a wok, a multi-level metal steamer or a bamboo steamer. Just make sure the steaming rack is at least 1½ inches above the water so the boiling water doesn’t touch the buns during the cooking process. Carefully put the buns inside the steamer, cover the lid, and let the buns rest for about 20 minutes (do not turn on the stove yet!).
When the buns are ready to be cooked, turn the heat on high to start the steaming process. Once the water starts to boil and steam is visible, turn the heat down to medium, and steam the buns for another 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, shut off the heat, and let the buns rest inside the steamer for 5 minutes. DO NOT REMOVE THE COVER. This is an important step, because if you remove the cover too early, the buns will collapse and lose their fluffiness! And if you are steaming buns in multiple batches, be sure to start each batch with cold water!
These buns can be enjoyed immediately. You can also store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator or freezer. Reheat in the microwave for about 1 minute or re-steam for about 6-8 minutes.",en-US,"{'calories': '127 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '17 g', 'proteinContent': '3 g', 'fatContent': '5 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '3 g', 'sodiumContent': '270 mg', 'fiberContent': '1 g', 'sugarContent': '2 g', 'servingSize': '1 serving'}",4.84,,The Woks of Life,150,14 serving(s)

Heat your wok over medium heat, and add 1 tablespoon of the oil left from tofu-frying, and add the ginger. After 10 seconds, add the garlic and the whole dried chili peppers, and stir for 15 seconds. Next, stir in the red bell peppers and Shaoxing wine.
Now add the water or vegetable stock, and let the mixture come up to a boil. Add the broccoli florets.
Immediately add the soy sauces, rice vinegar, salt, sugar, and sesame oil. Let the mixture come up to a boil. Immediately add the cornstarch mixture slowly while stirring.
The sauce should be thick enough to coat a spoon. Feel free to add more or less of the cornstarch mixture depending on how thick you like your sauce, but give it 30 seconds to 1 minute between additions, as it does take some time for the sauce to thicken.
Toss in your fried tofu and give everything a quick stir to make sure the tofu is coated.

Transfer them to a container that allows air to circulate around them, such as a mesh colander, or a baking rack set on top of a baking sheet. Do not overcrowd the mushrooms.
Place them in a well ventilated area (any area of the house with a ready supply of fresh air), preferably in the sun if possible. Allow them to air dry for 7-10 days, until they do not give when squeezed. Drying time will vary based on humidity levels and the size of the mushrooms.
To expedite the process, you can partially dehydrate them in the oven before air drying. Place in an oven heated to 175 degrees F/80 degrees C for 2 hours, flipping them halfway through. Then transfer to a colander to air-dry for another 3-5 days.

Veggie Pizza and Kaitlin's Perfect Pizza Method!,Kaitlin,https://thewoksoflife.com/veggie-pizza-2-variations-kaitlins-perfect-pizza-method/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/pizza-4-1.jpg,"['2 1/2 cups warm water', '1 tablespoon sugar', ""2 1/4 oz. packets active dry yeast ((if you're using bulk yeast, use 4 1/2 teaspoons))"", '1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil', ""7 cups bread flour or all-purpose flour ((or a blend of the two! I've achieved excellent results with all combos))"", '1 level tablespoon fine sea salt', 'Your favorite jarred or homemade tomato sauce ((warmed))', '1 small onion ((sliced thinly))', ""1 block of mozzarella cheese ((grated, we prefer regular ol' mozz over fresh for these pizzas but feel free to go with fresh!))"", '1 cup grape tomatoes ((halved))', '1 small potato ((sliced into extremely thin rounds and tossed with olive oil, salt and pepper))', '1/3 of a Japanese eggplant', '3 cups spinach leaves (roughly chopped)', 'Large handful of fresh basil ((torn))', 'Salt', 'Freshly ground black pepper', 'Extra virgin olive oil', '2/3 cup ricotta cheese', '1/4 cup sun-dried tomatoes ((roughly chopped))']","To make the dough:
In a large bowl, dissolve the sugar in the warm water. Mix in the yeast with a fork, breaking up big clumps, and follow with the olive oil. Give it a quick stir and allow to sit for 15-20 minutes, until it's uber- foamy and puffed up in the bowl!
When it's good and foamy, start adding your flour one cup at a time, stirring with a wooden spoon or spatula. After the first cup, sprinkle the salt over the mixture evenly. Keep adding flour. After adding the fifth cup, assess your consistency--if it's still quite wet, inch towards 6 cups. If it's dry enough to start kneading, dive in with floured hands. I always leave some flour allowance between what I add during the mixing phase and the total stated because you're going to add flour as you knead.
Knead the dough for 5-10 minutes, adding flour to make the dough smooth and elastic. It will stick to your hands in the beginning; just scrape it off and add more flour as you go. It's helpful to measure out your remaining amount of flour (so 7 cups minus what you've already added before kneading) so you don't surpass the maximum amount required as you marvel over your lovely dough.
When the dough is smooth and elastic, and there are no more excess dough bits at the bottom of your bowl, sprinkle some fresh flour in the bottom of the bowl and on top of your dough, cover with a warm damp cloth, and let rise in a warm room or a closed oven for 1 hour, or until doubled in size.
At this point, you can punch the dough down, or cover the bowl with plastic wrap and put it in the fridge until you’re ready to use it. I like to use it right away because a dough that sits in the fridge too long starts to develop an unpleasant yeasty flavor, though others would probably contradict me.
When you’re ready to roll out the crust, preheat your oven to 500 degrees. If you're using a stone, make sure that's in the oven. Liberally flour your board prior to rolling out your dough. I can't emphasize this enough, because if you'll be sliding your pizza onto a stone in the oven, it will need to be jiggly enough on your cutting board when weighed down with toppings to slide oh-so-effortlessly onto the stone. Seriously. You've been warned. You should be using a wooden board, will which act as your MacGyver-ed pizza peel, if you're going the pizza stone route. If you're using a sheet pan, just roll the dough out on the pan.
Okay, now comes the tricky part. Rolling out the dough. Seems simple--just grab your rolling pin and squidge the hell out of it until it's a neat circle, right? WRONG.
When you start with your gob of dough, you want to roughly shape it with floured hands into a flattish circle. At this point it will be thick--about an inch. Then you want to go in with the fists. We're talkin' pizzeria level technique here--but it's seriously not hard! Just place the dough on your two fists and imagine that your making tiny little vertical fist pumps with your hands rotating slightly. As you do this, the dough will naturally stretch by its own weight. Better yet, the dough will stretch from the center (i.e. where your fists contact the dough), which means that you'll end up with a slightly thicker edge. That's your crust! Now your job is to make sure the dough stretches evenly and that no holes are allowed to punch through your lovely dough. You'll want to do this until the dough is about a quarter inch thick. Unevenness within a range of 1/8""-1/4"" is totally fine. In fact, it's your friend. Lay the dough down on your liberally floured board.
If you're one of those people that is adamant about your pizza being, in fact, a circle, now is when you grab the rolling pin. Use the pin to roll out from the center, never allowing the pin to squish your crust. Rolling the dough out shouldn't be in a traditional Paula-Deen-pie-crust way, but with the pin angled to follow the radius of the dough until you've achieved a circle with a raised crust. So you're not rolling out from the center, you're rolling around to follow the circle of the dough. Again, never letting the pin crush the crust. This means the pin should be angled ever so slightly at about 15-20 degrees to preserve crust height. If you see air bubbles--excellent, use the pin or your hands to gently push them to the edges (THESE WILL BE CRUST BUBBLES!).
Now. You're ready for toppings.
To make the Veggie Supreme Pizza:
Grab your sauce. Spread it evenly on your pie. Sprinkle over the sliced onions, followed by half of the mozzarella cheese you want on the pizza. Sprinkle over some grape tomatoes, followed by the potato and eggplant rounds, spinach, and basil. Sprinkle with more mozzarella, season with salt and pepper, and drizzle with olive oil. Bake for 10-14 minutes at 500-550 degrees F.
To make the Spinach and Sun-Dried Tomato White Pizza:
Spread a thin layer of olive oil over your crust. Spread on a layer of ricotta cheese, and sprinkle with onion and cherry tomatoes. Sprinkle on half the mozzarella you want on the pie, followed by the spinach, basil, and chopped sun-dried tomato. Sprinkle with more cheese, season with salt and pepper, and drizzle with olive oil.

We used lotus paste.
Make sesame ball dough. Place 1/2 cup (60g) glutinous rice flour and sugar in a bowl. Pour ¼ cup (60g) of boiling water into the flour and sugar. Mix with a rubber spatula until smooth. Let sit for 5 minutes. Add ¼ cup + 1 tablespoon (70g) room temperature water and the rest of the glutinous flour (1 cup, 120g). Mix with a spatula until it forms a dough, and all the flour has been incorporated. Cover with an overturned plate or put it in a reusable silicone bag. Set aside to rest for 30 minutes.
Prepare your sesame seeds by pouring them in a fine-meshed strainer and rinsing them until they're completely soaked. Let the excess water drain and place the sesame seeds on a plate. Spread them out evenly with enough space for rolling the sesame balls. You can use a paper towel if the sesame seeds are very wet. They should be moist, but not dripping wet.
Your filling should be half the weight of your dough ball. Use your kitchen scale to measure out 8 pieces of lotus or red bean paste that weigh 24g each. Roll them into balls and set aside.
Weigh the dough ball on a digital kitchen scale – it should weigh about 370 to 380 grams. Whatever your weight is, divide it by 8 to get the weight for each dough ball (in our case, we got 47g). Using the kitchen scale, separate the dough into 8 equal pieces, and roll them into balls. Set them aside on a plate, and cover them so they don’t dry out.
To assemble, flatten the dough ball until it is 3 inches in diameter – the middle should be slightly thicker. Place 1 ball of filling in the center of the dough, wrapping the dough around the ball. Pinch the dough together so it covers all the filling, making the thickness of the dough as even as possible. You can pinch excess dough from the point where the sesame ball is sealed to fill empty spots or reinforce areas that look thin.
After the filling is completely covered, gently press it all together to form a ball, rolling it between the palms of your hands until the seams disappear, and you form a uniform round ball.
Roll the ball in the moistened sesame seeds until the entire ball is thoroughly covered. Roll the ball again in your hands to press the sesame seeds into the dough and place on parchment paper until they are ready to deep-fry.
Heat 4 cups of peanut or canola oil in a medium deep pot to a stable 320°F/160°C. (Use a thermometer for accuracy, as achieving the right oil temperature is extremely important.) The oil should fill the pot about halfway.
Add 4 sesame balls into the oil, and immediately use a slotted spoon to gently move them in a circular motion so they do not stick to the pot. This is a necessary step throughout the entire process to ensure even frying. Don’t leave them unattended. Adding the sesame balls will lower the oil temperature down below 300°F/150°C, but shouldn’t take it below 290°F/143°C. Adjust the heat slightly higher or lower to maintain the oil temperature at 300°F/150°C.
After 10 minutes, your sesame balls will begin to float to the top of the oil. Now, your technique changes to keep them rolling in the oil so all sides get the same frying time. You can also occasionally press all four sesame balls down using a slotted spoon or small spider to keep them submerged in the oil. Do this for 2-3 minutes.
At this stage, increase the heat to bring the oil temperature gradually up to 350°F. Fry them for another 5 minutes, for a total of 17-18 minutes, or until they turn a light golden brown. This last stage of frying at a higher temperature browns them. The sesame balls will expand and grow slightly at this higher oil temperature. The outer crust is now strong enough such that they should not burst, as long as you don’t have any weak or thin spots in the dough.
Transfer the finished sesame balls to a strainer, cooling rack or plate lined with paper towels for the oil to drain. Repeat with the second batch.

Drain the rice noodles in a colander and set aside.
Prepare the vegetables and set them aside. The dish comes together quickly, so it helps to put them on plates ready to go by the stove. If using dried mushrooms, soak them for at least 30 minutes in hot water. (For other tips, see our Chinese Dried and Preserved Ingredients page.)

Cover the wok for 1 minute if you feel it’s not hot enough or if the noodles are not lightly sizzling. A quiet wok at this point means there’s not enough heat! If your stove heat is not very strong, warming the noodles may take longer, and they may start to dry out. If this happens, add 2 tablespoons of water around the perimeter of the wok.
When steam starts rising from your noodles and they’re nearly done, add the other ⅓ of the leeks to the mixture. Stir fry for another minute, incorporating the leeks.

Scoop the veggies into a colander and rinse the bowl clean of any sand. Repeat the process until you don’t see any dirt on the leaves or at the bottom of your bowl.

Once you have the ginger and garlic in the pan, add the veggies and turn the heat up to the highest setting.

We used instant dashi, but if you want to make it yourself, we have detailed instructions in our Miso Soup recipe. At this point, you can also cook the rice you’ll serve with the tempura.
Next, prepare the vegetables, making sure everything is washed and trimmed. Nothing should be too wet ahead of frying, so if needed, pat the vegetables with a kitchen towel or let them sit at room temperature to dry off while you prep everything else.
Score the shrimp with a sharp knife so that they can lay flat (you can do this lightly if you don’t mind them retaining some of their curved shape). Refrigerate the shrimp until you’re ready to fry.
Next, make the batter. Stir together the ice water, cake flour, and egg yolks. No need to get rid of all the lumps—in fact, take care not to overmix it. Pop it in the refrigerator while you heat the frying oil.
In a small deep pot, heat enough oil to fill it about halfway, over medium-high heat. While that’s happening, set up a wire rack over a sheet pan or a platter lined with paper towels. When a drop of the batter sizzles vigorously but doesn’t brown too quickly, you’re ready to go.
To fry, swirl one piece of vegetable or shrimp in the batter (for the shrimp, hold it by the tail), and lower it gently into the batter. Fry everything in batches of 3-4 items for 45-90 seconds, turning each item 3-4 times. When the vegetables are lightly golden and the shrimp are lightly golden, orange, and floating, it’s ready to be transferred to the wire rack.
Adjust the heat as needed between batches as you add cold food to the oil. The oil should be hot enough that it doesn’t take too long to cook the tempura, but not so hot that the food immediately turns golden when it hits the oil.
To assemble the tempura donburi bowls, spoon a base of steamed rice into each bowl. Top with with vegetables and a few shrimp per bowl.

Sear for 30 seconds. Turn the heat down to medium, and cook the pork until it’s no longer pink. Add the grated ginger and mix for 30 seconds until combined.
Next, stir in the grated carrots and add 1 tablespoon of Shaoxing wine. Stir-fry the carrots for another 30 seconds, and add 2 cups warm water. Bring the mixture to a simmer.
Stir in 1½ teaspoons salt, ½ teaspoon fresh ground white pepper, and 1 teaspoon sesame oil. Simmer for 3 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in the chopped scallions, bring back to a simmer, and turn off the heat.
Scoop out the pork, carrots and scallions into a mixing bowl, leaving behind as much liquid in the wok as you can. Pour the rest of the remaining liquid into a measuring cup, and add more water until there is a total of 1⅔ cups (395ml).
Add the rice flour and cornstarch to the carrot mixture and mix in the 1⅔ cups of liquid until everything is well combined, and there are no visible lumps of flour. Set aside. Spread 2 teaspoons vegetable oil in a 9-inch glass loaf pan, ensuring all sides are evenly coated.
Prepare your steamer or wok with a steaming rack, ensuring there is enough water. 2 to 3 quarts for 60 minutes of steaming should do the trick. Bring the water to a slow boil.
Stir your carrot and rice flour mixture again until combined (it will have settled), and pour the batter into the oiled loaf pan. Immediately place the loaf pan on top of the steaming rack. Cover and steam at medium heat for 60 minutes.
You can double-check that your carrot is done when a thin chopstick can easily penetrate to the bottom of the loaf and the chopstick is not coated in batter. Transfer the loaf pan to a cooling rack. Let rest for 30 minutes. It is normal to have some water on the surface of the carrot rice cake after steaming. It will reabsorb into the loaf.
At this point, you can prepare your carrot rice cake to eat or refrigerate it for later. When you are ready to serve your carrot rice cake, remove it from the loaf pan. It’s best to run a knife around the loaf to separate the sides from the pan, then turn the loaf pan over onto a cutting board.

This process entails chopping and folding the shrimp paste over and onto itself, and continuing to chop. Transfer the shrimp paste to a bowl.
Chop the scallions. Set aside half of the green portion for the sauce. Add the rest of the chopped scallion to the shrimp, along with 1 teaspoon salt, 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil, 1 1/2 tablespoons cornstarch, 2 teaspoons Shaoxing wine, and white pepper to taste. Use a fork to beat/whip the shrimp until it is smooth and all the ingredients are well-combined.
Pop the stems off the bell peppers and follow the lines of each pepper to cut into 3-5 segments. Remove the seeds. If using long hot green peppers, just cut them in half lengthwise and remove the seeds.
Stuff each pepper segment with the shrimp mixture until the filling is even with the edges of the peppers. You can also trim the ends of the peppers to ensure they are flush and at the same level of the filling. This will make the peppers easier to cook.
Heat a tablespoon of oil in a wok or skillet over medium high heat and place the peppers in the oil, stuffing side down. Cook until they are browned, about 2 minutes. Turn the peppers over to sear the bottoms for another 2 minutes, turning the heat down if they start to get too dark. If using the long hot green peppers or another variety of thin-fleshed pepper, simply transfer them to the serving plate.
If using bell peppers, which have thicker flesh and take longer to cook, add 2 tablespoons of water to the pan, cover, and steam for another 2 minutes, or until the peppers are just tender. Set aside on a serving plate.
It's time to make the sauce, which only takes a couple minutes. Heat the wok over medium heat and add the oil, garlic and fermented black beans. Stir-fry for a few seconds and add the shaoxing wine. When the wine is bubbly, add the rest of the sauce ingredients (except the cornstarch slurry) and bring to a simmer. Once simmering, add the cornstarch slurry gradually until the sauce is thick enough to coat a spoon.

In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar, and salt. Cut in the butter with a pastry cutter or two knives until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Whisk together the egg yolk and water, and add it to the flour mixture. Mix everything together with a fork until the dough comes together. Flatten into a disk, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and place in the refrigerator to chill for at least an hour. Take out of the refrigerator about a few minutes before you’re ready to roll it out.
Roll out the dough and fit it to your tart pan. You may have to patch it up a bit, but don’t worry, it’ll turn out great. Pierce the dough all over with a fork and place the tart shell in the freezer for 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the chopped leeks and cook for about 10 minutes. Add the kale, crushed red pepper flakes, and a couple drizzles of olive oil. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Cook for another couple minutes, just until the kale is wilted. Remove from the heat.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (210 degrees C). Blind bake the tart shell for 10 minutes, and remove from the oven. If you see it starting to puff up at all, poke the dough with a fork again!
Prep your potato by peeling it and slicing it paper-thin. A mandolin helps, but a sharp knife will do the job. Add the thyme and ricotta (or cream cheese) to the kale mixture. Place a layer of sweet potato slices in the bottom of the tart shell. Spread the kale and cheese mixture evenly over that, and top with another layer of sweet potato slices.

Scrub the radishes clean and rinse. Do NOT peel them. Trim the top and bottom of each radish, and trim away any blemishes or dark spots. Cut them into ½ inch x 2.5 inch pieces (1.25 cm x 6.25 cm). Transfer to a large stainless steel or glass container.
Toss the daikon pieces with 1 ½ tablespoons salt, and set aside for 2 hours.
After 2 hours, squeeze as much liquid out as you can from the daikon pieces. Spread them in a single layer on a baking sheet, or better yet, a wide colander, to allow for airflow. Place in the sun and cover with cheesecloth. Allow to sun dry for 2-3 days (move it indoors at night and keep it at room temperature).
You’ll know that your daikon has reached an ideal level of dryness when they have reduced in size by half. They should feel soft and dry to the touch, and not release any kind of liquid when squeezed.
At this point, you can store them in a glass container and refrigerate as you would with other condiments. Use them in stir-fries and noodle soups––any dish that can use a bit of salt and crunch. Just wash and chop them before cooking.
Seasoning Preserved Daikon:
If you'd like to season your daikon, boil a large pot of water, cover, and allow to cool completely. Use the boiled, cooled water to wash the dried daikon pieces, rubbing them between your palms as you wash to re-hydrate slightly and remove excess salt. Squeeze out as much water as you can.
In a clean mixing bowl, combine the daikon pieces with 1 teaspoon sugar, 1 ½ teaspoons sesame oil, 2 teaspoons light soy sauce, 1 heaping tablespoon of pickled chili sauce, and a small pinch of dried chili flakes. Mix well, cover, and allow to sit in the refrigerator overnight.

Add the ginger, letting it caramelize and infuse the oil. Take care not to let it burn. Add the minced garlic, and give it a stir. Immediately add the watercress (if you wait too long, your garlic could burn). Turn the heat up to high.
Stir-fry the watercress for 20 seconds to evenly distribute the ginger, garlic and oil. Once mixed, move all of the watercress to the center of the wok in a small pile, and cover the wok.
After 45 seconds, uncover the wok. There should be plenty of steam at this point. Use a circular stirring motion to drag the pile of watercress and some of the liquid around the sides of the superheated wok. Stirring the watercress against the hottest and driest part of the wok will generate that wok hay flavor. Gather the watercress back in the middle of the wok.

Use it per your own tastes and perspectives!)
Stir-fry the mixture again to mix in the seasonings, once more stirring the watercress and the liquid so it hits the sides of the wok to generate more wok hay.
Use your wok spatula to scoop the watercress onto a shallow rimmed bowl, making sure to get the remaining liquid, as it’s super-infused with garlic, ginger, and those vitamins from the watercress.

To remove any dirt or sand, soak them in a large bowl of water for 10 minutes. Shake the vegetables to loosen the grit. Lift the vegetables out of the dirty water and rinse. Rinse the bowl, fill with fresh water, and repeat this process two more times. This cleaning step is very important.
In a large pot, add 10 cups (2.4 liters) of water, bring to a boil, and turn the heat down to medium low. Stir in 1 ½ tablespoons (26g) of salt, until dissolved.
Place the mustard greens into the simmering water 1 or 2 at a time, so they’re completely submerged. Blanch for 30 seconds, rotating them to evenly heat them on all sides. Lift the mustard greens out of the water and transfer to a clean sheet pan to cool.
Next, put the sliced ginger into the blanching water and bring the water back to a simmer. Once simmering, turn off the heat, and allow the liquid to cool to room temperature.
Once the vegetables are cool enough to handle, pour off any excess water from your sheet pan and rub salt (2 ¼ teaspoons/13g per pound of mustard greens) all over the greens, getting into the inner stems and rubbing the salt evenly across each stem/leaf until it has dissolved.
Place into a non-reactive bowl—stainless steel, enamel, ceramic, or glass work—and pour the ginger-infused blanching liquid over the vegetables. Place a large plate on top of the vegetables with a heavy pot (or a pot filled with water) on top to press them down and keep them submerged. Allow the greens to sit in the salted water for 24 hours at room temperature, covered with a clean towel or paper.
Disinfect the jar by first washing it thoroughly. Wash your hands, and rinse the jar with boiling water. With clean hands or tongs, lift the mustard greens out of the brine solution and let any excess liquid drain for a few seconds.
Squeeze the vegetables tightly. This removes spaces where air bubbles can form, and also makes them more compact. Place them into the jar along with the ginger slices. Do your best to squeeze the vegetables into the jar and distribute the ginger evenly. Reserve the brine, as you will be adding it to the jar momentarily.
Measure 1 teaspoon (6g) salt and ¾ teaspoon (3g) sugar per pound of greens, and sprinkle on top of the vegetables in the jar. Measure out 2 tablespoons (30 ml) white vinegar per pound of vegetables, and pour it over the salt and sugar in the jar.
Next, use a clean ladle to carefully transfer the brine into the jar until it is almost full. Check for air pockets that may be trapped near the bottom of the jar. Use a chopstick to move the mustard greens around to release any air bubbles. You can also cap the jar and move it around to coax air bubbles up to the top. Once you feel all air bubbles have been eliminated, fill the jar to the top to ensure that all of the greens are completely submerged in liquid.
Take a 10- to 12-inch square piece of plastic wrap and fold it in half twice to make a neat smaller square. Place it over the jar, making sure there are no air bubbles under the plastic wrap. Screw the top on over the plastic wrap to create an airtight fit.
Use a clean kitchen cloth to wipe any liquid from the jar and place a label on it with the date. Place the jar in a cool dark place for about 2 days, or until the mustard greens have turned from a bright green to a dull green.
After the mustard greens turn a dull green (2 days), put them in the back of the refrigerator, and they should be ready to eat in 7 days.",en-US,"{'calories': '40 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '7 g', 'proteinContent': '4 g', 'fatContent': '1 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '1 g', 'sodiumContent': '987 mg', 'fiberContent': '4 g', 'sugarContent': '2 g', 'servingSize': '1 serving'}",5.0,,The Woks of Life,14505,12 serving(s)

Time to make the mini sticky rice balls. Mix the sweet rice flour with ¼ cup of water in a bowl using your hands. Then add ½ teaspoon water at a time until the dough turns into a play-doh-like consistency—not too wet but pliable.

Next, place the tofu on a flat surface lined with clean kitchen towels or paper towels and pat the sides dry. Transfer to a cutting board.
Cut the tofu into ½-inch cubes and allow them to continue to drain for a few minutes.
Meanwhile, in a mixing bowl, combine 1/3 cup cornstarch, garlic powder, onion powder, 5 spice powder, salt and water until a thick batter forms. Add the tofu and gently toss in the batter until thoroughly coated.
Prepare the sauce by mixing together the soy sauce, dark soy sauce, sugar, salt, rice vinegar, sesame oil, 2 teaspoons cornstarch and 2/3 cup warm water. Stir the sauce until everything is dissolved and combined.
Add 1/4 cup of peanut oil (or vegetable oil) to a medium to large nonstick frying pan over low heat and add 1 cup of the blanched shelled peanuts. Stir the peanuts in the wok for 5 minutes until they are golden brown. You’ll notice the peanuts releasing more oil into the pan. Remove the peanuts from the pan, and set aside, leaving behind any oil in the pan.
Next, adjust the heat to medium, and gently place each cube of tofu in the pan. Let the tofu fry for about 5 minutes, or until the bottoms are browned. Turn the tofu with a spatula (they’ll stick together slightly, which may make it easier to flip a bunch of pieces all at once) and let the other side fry for another 5 minutes until the bottom is browned again. At this point, use a spatula to gently separate any tofu pieces that may be sticking together. Set the tofu aside.
Use 1 ½ tablespoons of the remaining oil from frying the peanuts and tofu to coat your wok. Add the carrots and stir-fry over medium heat for 1 minute. Add the ginger and dried chili peppers.
Toast the ginger and chili peppers for about 20 seconds and add the garlic and scallions. Stir-fry for another 20 seconds. Stir up the pre-mixed sauce with a chopstick or spoon since the cornstarch is likely to have settled, and add the sauce to the wok.
Turn the heat up to high, and bring the sauce to a simmer. Once the sauce begins to thicken and reduce, add the tofu and peanuts.
Toss the tofu and peanuts into the sauce until everything is coated. Keep stir-frying until the sauce has reduced and is clinging to the tofu and peanuts. At this point, you can stir in the Sichuan peppercorn powder, or you can sprinkle it on top.

Add ¼ cup oil to the wok and heat over medium-high heat. Add the ginger and fry until fragrant (the color will darken, but the ginger will not necessarily become crisp). Next, add the garlic. It should be lightly toasted; if it’s still white in color, it needs more cooking time. In total, it will take about 10 minutes time to cook the ginger and garlic.
Next, turn the heat up to high and add the rice to the wok. Stir-fry the rice so the ginger/garlic mixture is evenly distributed. Spread the rice out in one layer so it can evenly toast. Occasionally stir-fry the rice and re-spread it. Next, season the rice with the soy sauce, Shaoxing wine, and white pepper. Continue to stir-fry for another 3-5 minutes.
Next, pour the eggs evenly over the rice, and stir-fry quickly to distribute. The egg will coat the grains of rice, and you’ll have egg throughout instead of large clumps. If you’d prefer to pre-scramble the eggs and then stir them in at this step, you can do that too.

Put all of the meat filling ingredients in a mixing bowl. Stir in one direction for about 5-10 minutes until the meat mixture becomes a very sticky paste. Set it aside.
Step 2: Assembly
Peel, wash, and cut the lotus roots into 1/8-inch slices. Rinse the lotus root slices in cold water to wash away excess starch and so they don’t turn black (again, they're similar to potatoes). Drain. It’s best to spin them in a salad spinner to get rid of all the excess water.
Take one slice, and spread on a thin layer of meat filling. Top it with another slice of lotus root to create a sandwich. Gently press the two slices together so the meat filling fills the holes of the lotus root on both sides This step will “lock” the two slices together. Repeat until you've used all of the slices. You should be able to make about 15-18 pieces.
Step 3: Make the batter
Add both flours, salt and the five-spice powder to a mixing bowl. Slowly add the water, stirring constantly. Stir thoroughly until any lumps have dissolved. Then stir in the beer. This batter is pretty light. You can thicken it by adding a bit more flour if you like a heavier batter. Also, stir the batter between dipping each lotus root piece, as sweet rice flour tends to settle quickly.
(Don’t coat the lotus roots until right before frying. If too much liquid gets in between the meat and the lotus roots by coating too early, they will fall apart in your pot of oil.) Speaking of which...
Step 4: Frying
Now it’s time to prepare the oil for frying. I like to use a small, deep pot because it requires less oil and its depth helps contain the oil, avoiding splatters and burns.
Fill the pot about 1.5” deep with oil, and heat it to 275 degrees. Once the oil reaches 275 degrees, coat the lotus in the batter and slowly lower into the oil. Fry a few pieces at a time, frying each side for about 6 – 7 minutes. Take them out and set them aside on a plate lined with a paper towel. Repeat until all the lotus sandwiches are fried. Now turn up the heat to bring the oil up to 325 degrees. Re-fry each piece for 3 minutes to really get the color and crunchiness that we are looking for.",en-US,"{'calories': '385 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '30 g', 'proteinContent': '14 g', 'fatContent': '23 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '5 g', 'cholesterolContent': '41 mg', 'sodiumContent': '608 mg', 'fiberContent': '6 g', 'sugarContent': '1 g', 'servingSize': '1 serving'}",5.0,,The Woks of Life,90,6 serving(s)

Transfer to a bowl, and stir in the egg, cornstarch, and half of the chopped scallions. Set the mixture aside in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.
Cut each eggplant into 1 1/2-inches thick slices on the diagonal. Take each slice and carefully slice through the middle, but don’t cut all the way through. The pieces should still be attached on one side. This will help keep both halves of the eggplant together.
Fill the middle of each eggplant slice with the shrimp and pork filling. Once all the slices are stuffed, heat a tablespoon of oil in a skillet over medium-high heat, and fry the slices on both sides until golden. Add a little more oil whenever the pan starts to look a little dry (you’ll only need a tablespoon at a time).
Remove from the pan and place on a heatproof plate for steaming. Prepare your steamer with 2-3 cups water (you can also use a wok with a steaming rack placed in the bottom). Heat until the water is simmering. Turn off the heat, carefully place the plate in the steamer. Cover the steamer and turn the heat back on to medium-high. Steam for 7-10 minutes. The eggplant should be very soft. Nothing worse than an under-cooked eggplant!
While the eggplant is steaming, make the sauce. Heat a saucepan over medium heat, and add 1 teaspoon oil, sesame oil, and minced garlic. Cook for 30 seconds, and then add the chicken stock, oyster sauce, soy sauce, and sugar. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Bring the sauce to a simmer, and stir in half of the cornstarch slurry. Cook for a minute to thicken. Set aside.
After the eggplant is done, pour any liquid left on the plate into the sauce. Heat the sauce and add more cornstarch slurry if it needs thickening. Stir in your reserved scallions, pour over the eggplant, and serve.",en-US,"{'calories': '350 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '20 g', 'proteinContent': '17 g', 'fatContent': '23 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '14 g', 'cholesterolContent': '163 mg', 'sodiumContent': '966 mg', 'fiberContent': '7 g', 'sugarContent': '9 g', 'servingSize': '1 serving'}",5.0,,The Woks of Life,60,4 serving(s)

"Stir-Fried Lettuce, A Healthy Cooked Lettuce Recipe",Bill,https://thewoksoflife.com/stir-fried-lettuce/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/stir-fried-lettuce-5-1.jpg,"['1 head iceberg lettuce', '2 teaspoons soy sauce', '2 tablespoons oyster sauce', '¼ teaspoon sesame oil', '½ teaspoon salt', '¼ teaspoon sugar', 'ground white pepper (to taste)', '2 tablespoons vegetable oil', '1 slice ginger ((⅛-inch thick, smashed with the side of a knife))', '1 clove garlic ((chopped))']","Take the lettuce and firmly hit it on the counter to remove the core. (One of the first of many tricks I learned when working in the restaurant industry!)
Remove the first outer layer of the lettuce and any discolored leaves and discard. Tear the lettuce with your hands into large 4 to 5-inch pieces.
Place the lettuce in a large bowl of very cold water and give it a good stir. This washes your lettuce and rehydrates it. Next, drain the lettuce in a colander and give it a good shake to remove the excess water from the surface of the lettuce. Iceberg lettuce already contains a lot of water, so removing the excess water is important, or you’ll end up with too much liquid. Feel free to use a salad spinner, which is a good idea if your stove and wok does not generate enough high heat.
Combine the soy sauce, oyster sauce, sesame oil, salt, sugar, white pepper into a small bowl and set aside.
Heat your wok over low heat, and add 2 tablespoons of oil and the fresh ginger slice. Make sure to smash the ginger with the side of a knife to release the juices and flavors before you add it. Infuse the oil for 15 seconds, being careful not to burn the ginger.
Turn the heat up to the highest setting, and stir in the chopped garlic. Then mmediately add the iceberg lettuce. Stir-fry everything together, using a scooping motion to coat the lettuce uniformly with the oil. After about 20 seconds, gather the lettuce in the middle of the wok in a pile, so you can see the liquid pooling around it in the wok.
Let cook uncovered for another 15 seconds, and while this is happening, pour the soy sauce mixture over the lettuce. At this point, the sides of the wok will start to super-heat. This may be tough to achieve on your average stove burner, but do your best!
Now in a single motion, stir the lettuce in a circular motion while spreading the lettuce out across the wok. The idea is to get the lettuce and the liquid searing along the sides of the wok to get that wok hei flavor. After the searing has stopped, repeat the process of gathering the lettuce in the middle of the wok again and letting the sides of the wok heat up again.
After this second round of searing, your iceberg lettuce should be tender, with the green parts wilted. Stir fried lettuce should be slightly crunchy, so be sure not to overcook it. This whole process from start to finish takes less than 2 minutes in the wok.",en-US,"{'calories': '90 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '6 g', 'proteinContent': '2 g', 'fatContent': '7 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '6 g', 'sodiumContent': '718 mg', 'fiberContent': '2 g', 'sugarContent': '3 g', 'servingSize': '1 serving'}",5.0,,The Woks of Life,12,4 serving(s)

Heat 6 tablespoons of butter in a small saucepan over low heat until it’s just melted. Remove from the heat. Next, use a brush to lightly brush the mushroom caps with melted butter, turning them over afterwards so they are top-side down.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. While the oven is preheating, make the stuffing. Stir ½ teaspoon onion powder, ½ teaspoon granulated garlic, 1 teaspoon dried thyme, ½ teaspoon paprika, and ¼ teaspoon salt (or to taste) into the butter until well combined. Use a rubber spatula to mix in ¾ cup plain or Italian breadcrumbs until all the breadcrumbs are saturated with butter. Next, add 1/3 cup grated parmesan cheese and 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh parsley, and stir to combine.
Stuff a spoonful of breadcrumb mixture into each mushroom cap but don't pack or compress the stuffing which will keep your stuffed mushrooms light and flaky, then bake them for 9-12 minutes. The mushrooms should be cooked through, but firm enough to pick up with your hands. You don’t want to overcook them, or they’ll be droopy and hard to handle.

Chop the soaked dried shrimp, and add it to a mortar and pestle along with the ¼ cup of water it soaked in. Also add the belacan, sliced shallot, garlic, dried chili, and holland chili. Mix and grind until well-combined. The belacan should dissolve into the other ingredients and be well-incorporated. Set aside for 15 minutes.
Add 1 ½ tablespoons oil to a wok or saucepan over medium heat, and add the sauce mixture. Fry for about 5-8 minutes, or until fragrant, stirring occasionally and adjusting the heat as necessary so it doesn’t burn. Set aside.
Trim and Wash the Water Spinach (Kangkung)
Trim the 1-2 inches from the tough ends of the water spinach and discard. Pick out and discard any leaves that aren’t fresh and vibrant green.
Cut the remaining water spinach into 2 to 3 inch (5-8 cm) lengths. Transfer them to a large basin of cold water. They should be fully submerged to clean them properly. Use your hands to agitate the water and the vegetables to shake out any grit. Soak for 5 to 10 minutes to allow any dirt or sand particles to settle.
Gently lift the water spinach out of the water to a colander. Discard the sandy water, and repeat the process 1-2 times, until the vegetables are clean.
Drain completely, giving the colander a few good shakes to remove excess water. You can also run the clean water spinach through a salad spinner to make sure it’s really dry.
Prepare Other Ingredients in Advance
Prepare and measure out the julienned ginger, chopped garlic, Shaoxing wine, sugar, MSG, and white pepper.
Cook!
Heat your wok over medium high heat until it begins to smoke. Immediately add 3 tablespoons of oil, along with the ginger and garlic. Stir for 5-10 seconds, and add the belacan sauce. Cook for another 10 seconds, and add the water spinach.
Immediately turn your heat up to the highest setting, and use a scooping motion to mix the vegetables, oil, and sauce together. When the vegetables are half wilted, gather them together in a pile in the center of the wok.
Pour the Shaoxing wine around the perimeter of the wok, and cover it. This will allow the sides of the wok to heat up, while the vegetables are protected from burning by the liquid pooled in the center. It’s a classic Cantonese technique, and can help you achieve a wok hei seared flavor even if you don’t have a large burner.
Depending on how hot your stove is, wait 30-60 seconds before removing the cover. Toss in the sugar, MSG, and white pepper.
Spread the vegetables out onto the sides of the wok, and mix in a circular motion to get them seared on the heated wok perimeter.
Gather the vegetables to the middle again, let the wok heat up for 30 seconds (uncovered), and repeat the process. Taste and add salt if needed.

Place your dried Shiitake mushrooms in a bowl of hot water. Cover and soak for 1 hour or until fully hydrated.
Once hydrated, cut off the stems and sliced them into strips. You can also use fresh shiitake mushrooms, but dried mushrooms are more fragrant!
Prepare your mung bean glass noodles
Soak the mung bean noodles in lukewarm water for 10 minutes until rehydrated. Use Kitchen shears to cut the noodles into 1 to 1½-inch lengths.
Cook the vegetable egg roll filling
Heat your wok over medium-high heat. Add 2 tablespoons peanut oil to the wok, and add the minced garlic and Shiitake mushrooms. Stir-fry for 15 seconds. Next, add the carrot and the red bell peppers. Stir-fry for another 15 seconds.
Turn up the heat to high, and add both of the cabbages. Toss everything together for 1 minute. Next, add the mung bean glass noodles, Shaoxing wine, salt, sugar, sesame oil, white pepper and five spice powder, if using. Stir-fry for another minute, mix in the chopped scallions, and transfer to a large bowl. Cool completely. NOTE: If your wok is smaller, you may have to cook the filling in two batches.
Fold the egg rolls
Place one egg roll wrapper flat with a corner toward you, so it looks like a diamond shape.
Measure a spoonful of filling (55g), placing it near the corner closest to you.
Fold the corner closest to you over the filling, and press the wrapper in so it hugs the filling.
Fold the two opposite corners inwards so it looks like an envelope.
Brush some egg wash on the opposite corner, and don’t miss any spots!
Fold the egg roll forward, ensuring the roll stays tucked tightly. The egg wash should keep the egg roll together.
To Fry the Egg Rolls:
In a small pot, heat your frying oil to 325 degrees F/160 degrees C. You don't need too much––just enough to submerge the egg rolls. Whatever size pot you’re using, make sure you only fill it halfway, so oil does not overflow when you are frying. Hot oil near open flames can be extremely dangerous and flare up!
Carefully place a couple egg rolls at a time into the oil. Fry for about 5 minutes until golden brown. Keep them moving in the oil to make sure they fry evenly.
Once the egg rolls are done, place them on a wire rack to let them drain and cool slightly.
To Bake the Egg Rolls (instead of frying):
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F/220 degrees C. Place the egg rolls on a baking sheet coated with oil or non-stick aluminum foil.
Lightly brush the egg rolls all over with peanut oil or vegetable oil, and bake until golden brown for 15-20 minutes.

On a sheet pan lined with parchment paper, add 24 dollops of peanut butter, each about 1 teaspoon. Place in the freezer and allow to harden for at least 1 hour, but preferably 3 hours. You can also do this overnight.
Preheat your oven to 425 degrees F. In a food processor, pulse the dry ingredients together (2 cups all purpose flour, 1 tablespoon baking powder, ¼ cup sugar, ½ teaspoon salt). Sprinkle in the butter cubes and pulse until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs with a few slightly larger butter lumps, about 12 pulses. If you don’t have a food processor, whisk the dry ingredients together in a bowl, and cut in the butter using 2 butter knives or a pastry blender. Transfer to a large mixing bowl.
Next, process the peanuts until you have a mix of fine and coarse crumbs. Mix with 1 tablespoon of sugar and set aside.
Mix the beaten egg yolk with the sour cream and stir into the dry mixture to make the dough. At this point, if the dough is still dry and not coming together, drizzle in 3 tablespoons of milk 1 tablespoon at a time until the dough is formed (you may not need all 3 tablespoons). Just before the dough fully comes together, sprinkle over the frozen peanut butter chunks.
Gently mix with your hands to bring the dough together and distribute the peanut butter chunks. They’ll smear a little bit, but try to keep them as whole as possible. Do not overwork the dough. As soon as the dough is cohesive enough to form into scones, you’re good to go.
On a floured surface, shape the dough into a square, about 1 inch thick. Cut the large square into 4 smaller squares, and then cut each small square in half on the diagonal to form 8 triangles. Transfer the scones to a parchment lined baking sheet, spaced a couple inches apart.
Using your fingers, make a crosshatch in each scone with your finger. You’re making a “well” to put the jam into. Using a spoon, carefully spoon the jam into the well. If you need to soften your jam to do this, microwave it for 15 seconds to loosen it up. Brush the scones with the 2 tablespoons of milk, avoiding the jelly, and sprinkle with the peanut sugar.

In the meantime, make the filling. In a wok or large skillet over medium high heat, add 3 tablespoons oil and add the ginger. Cook for 30 seconds, until fragrant. Add the onions and stir-fry until translucent.
Add the chopped mushrooms and stir-fry for another 3-5 minutes, until the mushrooms are tender and any liquid released by the mushrooms has cooked off.

To the bowl, add the chopped chives, white pepper, sesame oil, shaoxing wine, soy sauce, and sugar. Season with salt to taste (though the soy sauce will usually add enough salt to the filling), and stir in the last 1/4 cup of oil.
To assemble the dumplings, cut the dough into small tablespoon-sized pieces. Roll each out into a circle, and pleat the dumplings (see this post for step-by-step photos on how to fold a dumpling). Continue assembling until you've run out of filling and/or dough.
To cook the dumplings, steam them or pan-fry them. To steam, put the dumplings in a steamer lined with a bamboo mat, cabbage leaf, or cheese cloth, and steam for 15-20 minutes.
To pan-fry, heat 2 tablespoons oil in a non-stick pan over medium high heat. Place the dumplings in the pan and allow to fry for 2 minutes.

You want to leave the more tender parts of the stems, because part of the experience of eating water spinach is the hollow stems, which complement the tender leaves, giving a nice overall crunchy texture.
We like to wash our veggies thoroughly (3 times), and after the last rinse, we give everything a good shake in a large colander to drain the excess water. See our Chinese leafy green vegetables page for a complete description, and tips on how we like to wash our veggies!
Heat your wok over high heat, and add the oil and ginger. Stir for about 10 seconds to let the ginger infuse the oil, and then add the garlic and the XO sauce.
Give the mixture a quick stir--your wok should be close to smoking now, and add the Ong Choy, immediately moving the vegetables around with your spatula. The vegetables should cool the wok a bit, but it is important to stir the vegetables right away, and use a folding motion with your spatula to mix the oil and sauce evenly in with the vegetables.
If the vegetables get too tightly tangled into a ball, just use your wok spatula to spread the vegetables out in an even layer so each piece gets its fair share of oil and sauce. Season with sugar and salt.
After about a minute of stir frying, your vegetables should be coated evenly with the oil and sauce. Next, move the vegetables into a mound in the middle of the wok, keeping the heat on high. This technique is to allow the sides of the wok to super heat, so you can get that elusive “wok hay” signature flavor you taste at your favorite Chinese restaurants.
After about 30 seconds of high heat, there should be some liquid building up at the bottom of the wok--this actually protects your vegetables from burning and produces some steam to help the vegetables cook nicely. Next, use your wok spatula to spread your vegetable mound in a circular motion around the wok to get that searing “wok hay” effect for another 15-30 seconds. An essential technique is to turn your wok spatula upside down when spreading the water spinach around the side of the wok to get that sear.
Plate and serve immediately. If you’re feeling generous, add a bit more XO sauce on top for extra flavor and garnish.",en-US,"{'calories': '187 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '6 g', 'proteinContent': '3 g', 'fatContent': '18 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '1 g', 'sodiumContent': '420 mg', 'fiberContent': '3 g', 'sugarContent': '1 g', 'servingSize': '1 serving'}",5.0,,The Woks of Life,35,4 serving(s)
