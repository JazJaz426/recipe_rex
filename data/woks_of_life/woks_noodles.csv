Hainanese Chicken Rice,Judy,https://thewoksoflife.com/hainanese-chicken-rice/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/hainanese-chicken-rice-10.jpg,"['1 fresh or organic chicken ((3-3½ pounds))', '1 tablespoon salt', '12-14 cups water', '4-5 slices ginger', '2 whole scallions', 'Ice', 'Chicken fat ((taken from the back cavity of the chicken))', '4 cloves garlic ((minced))', '3 cups uncoooked white rice ((preferably jasmine rice, washed and drained))', 'Chicken stock ((from cooking the chicken))', '2 teaspoons salt', '4-inch piece ginger ((roughly chopped))', '1 clove garlic', '3 tablespoons oil', 'pinch of salt', '1/3 cup water', '3 tablespoons rock sugar ((about 3 sizable chunks, or just measure out granulated sugar))', '1/3 cup dark soy sauce', '6 fresh red chilies ((we used Holland chilies))', '3-inch piece ginger', '3 cloves garlic', '½ teaspoon sesame oil', '1 teaspoon salt', '½ teaspoon sugar', 'The juice of 1 small lime', '1 teaspoon rice vinegar ((or white vinegar))', '3-5 tablespoons chicken broth from boiling the chicken ((or until a saucy consistency is achieved))']","To Make the Chicken:
Wash the chicken clean and remember to set aside the piece of chicken fat at the back cavity. Transfer the chicken to a plate and pat dry with a paper towel. Lightly rub the chicken with the salt. This will give the chicken skin a nice sheen. Set it aside.
Bring the water, along with the ginger and scallions, to a boil in a large stockpot. Before adding the chicken to the pot, rinse the chicken under running water to wash away the salt. Carefully lower the chicken into the boiling water, positioning the chicken breast-side up. Now is a good time to adjust the water level so the chicken breast just pokes above the water (so you aren’t left with dry white meat).
Once the water boils, carefully lift the chicken out of the water to pour out the colder water that is trapped in the cavity. Carefully lower the chicken back into the pot. Bring the water to a boil again, and cover the lid. Turn off the heat, and leave the pot covered on the stove for 45-50 minutes (set a timer). To check if the chicken is done, stick a toothpick into the thickest part of the drumstick. If the juices run clear, it’s cooked through.
When the 45-minute timer (for the chicken) is almost up, prepare a large ice bath. Once the chicken is cooked, carefully lift the chicken out of the pot, drain the water from the cavity and lower it into the ice bath. Take care not to break the skin. After 15 minutes in the ice bath, the chicken should be cooled completely, drain and cover with clear plastic until ready to cut and serve. The ice bath stops the cooking process, locks in the juices, and gives the chicken skin better texture.
To make the rice:
While the chicken is cooling, make the rice. Heat a wok over medium heat. Add the chicken fat and render for about a minute. Stir in the minced garlic and fry briefly, making sure it doesn’t burn.
Add the uncooked rice. Stir continuously for about two minutes.
Turn off the heat. Scoop the rice into your rice cooker and add the appropriate amount of chicken stock (instead of the usual water. This amount may vary depending on your rice cooker) and salt. Close the lid and press START.
If you don’t have a rice cooker, you can follow these steps. When you wash your rice, let it soak for an additional 20 minutes. Then drain the rice and follow the same steps above, but instead of transferring the rice mixture to your rice cooker, transfer it to a medium/large pot. Add 3 cups of chicken stock and the salt, giving it a quick stir. Cover the pot and bring to a boil. Once it boils, immediately turn down the heat to the lowest setting. Let the rice simmer and cook (covered) for 10-15 minutes until the rice is done. It’s not quite as foolproof as the rice cooker, but you should get a very similar result. Just be sure to keep an eye on it; burnt rice is no fun.
While the rice is cooking, let’s prepare the three signature dipping sauces. You can also start preparing these sauces while the chicken is cooking in the pot.
To Make Sauce 1: The Ginger Garlic Sauce
Grind the ginger and garlic in a food processor until a paste forms. Heat the oil in a small pot or saucepan. Gently fry the ginger and garlic until aromatic and just lightly caramelized. You want it to be just cooked so that it no longer has that spicy raw flavor of uncooked ginger and garlic. Add salt to taste and transfer to a sauce dish.
To Make Sauce 2: Sweet Dark Soy Sauce
Heat the water and sugar in a small saucepan over medium heat. Stir constantly until the sugar dissolves and the liquid thickens into a simple syrup. Add the dark soy sauce, stirring to combine. Transfer to a sauce dish.
To Make Sauce 3: Chili Sauce
Grind the chilies, ginger, and garlic in a food processor until finely chopped. You will probably have to scrape down the sides of the food processor 1-2 times to ensure everything is ground up evenly. Add the sesame oil, salt, sugar, lime juice, and vinegar to the food processor. Pulse 2-3 times to combine.
Transfer to a small bowl and add chicken broth (what you used to boil the chicken) 1 tablespoon at a time until a saucy consistency is achieved. This is really about your preference too; if you like a thicker paste, add less broth. The broth also helps the sauce come together and adds additional chicken flavor!",en-US,"{'calories': '722 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '90 g', 'proteinContent': '32 g', 'fatContent': '25 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '6 g', 'cholesterolContent': '82 mg', 'fiberContent': '2 g', 'sugarContent': '10 g', 'servingSize': '1 serving'}",4.91,,The Woks of Life,155,6 serving(s)
Jianshui Zong (Alkaline Rice Dumplings - 碱水粽),Judy,https://thewoksoflife.com/alkaline-rice-dumplings-zongzi/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/alkaline-zongzi-24-1.jpg,"['9 ounces dried adzuki beans ((255g, 1 ¼ cups))', '3 ¾ cups water ((890 ml))', '½ teaspoon baking soda', '1/2 cup sugar ((100g, or to taste))', '¼ cup vegetable oil ((60 ml))', '1 pound sweet rice ((also called sticky rice, 450g or about 2 ¼ cups))', '1 ½ tablespoons lye water', '½ tablespoon vegetable oil', '30-40 dried bamboo leaves', '1 ½ teaspoons lye water', 'Kitchen string']","The Day Before: Make the Red Bean Paste:
Soak the red beans in water for 2 to 3 hours, then rinse off and drain.
Add the soaked red beans, 3 ¾ cups water, and baking soda to a medium pot. Cover and bring to a boil, then immediately reduce the heat to a simmer until the beans are softened and opened-up (about 30 minutes). Stir periodically to avoid burning.
If you see a lot of liquid remaining even after the beans are softened and have opened up, turn up the heat, remove the lid, and let the liquid cook off. While you’re doing this, watch the beans closely and stir occasionally to avoid burning. Remove from the heat and let the beans cool for a bit before pureeing the cooked beans in a food processor. You can also use an immersion blender, but a food processor will result in a more even puree.
Put the red bean puree in a thick-bottomed pan set over medium-high heat, and cook off the liquid, stirring constantly. This process will take about 25 to 30 minutes. Add the sugar (about 1/2 cup or to taste) early in the cooking process so it has a chance to fully dissolve.
Towards the end of the cooking time, add the ¼ cup of vegetable oil in two batches. The oil will prevent the puree from sticking to the pan too much. The paste is done once it “stays” in place rather than oozing across the pan. Transfer the paste to a dish, and let it cool before storing it in the refrigerator, covered.
The Night Before: Soak the Rice and Bamboo Leaves:
Rinse the sweet rice a couple of times until the water runs clear rather than cloudy. Next, transfer the rice to a large bowl with enough water so that the water line is ½-inch above the rice. Stir in 1½ tablespoons of lye water and ½ tablespoon vegetable oil. Once the lye water hits the fresh water, both the rice and water will turn a light yellow color––that’s normal. Soak the rice, covered, in the refrigerator overnight.
In a large basin (or your kitchen sink), soak the bamboo leaves overnight. Weigh the leaves down with something heavy to make sure all of the leaves are submerged.
The Next Day: Making and Cooking the Zongzi:
Clean each bamboo leaf, front and back, with a clean kitchen towel, shaking off any excess water and trimming off about a half inch of the bamboo leaf at the base (this part is too tough and rigid to handle). Set aside.
Take the soaked rice out of the refrigerator, and drain off all of the liquid. Set it aside.
Take out the red bean paste, and divide it into 15 equal-sized balls.
Now you’re ready to assemble the zongzi! Take two bamboo leaves and follow the steps shown in the photos, tying them off with kitchen string. Each rice dumpling takes about 2 tablespoons of soaked rice and one portion of red bean paste. Just remember not to tie the string too snugly, as the rice will need room to expand during the cooking process. After unwrapping a zongzi, it shouldn’t look like it has been wearing a pair of pants that’s two sizes too small. :)
In a large pot, arrange the zongzi neatly, and fill the pot with water--about 1-inch above the top of the zongzi. Add 1 ½ teaspoon of lye water to the pot, and place a heat-proof bowl or plate on top of everything to weigh down the zongzi. Bring the water to a boil, and then turn the heat to medium to slow cook the zongzi for 2½ hours. Check the water levels periodically, replenishing the pot with boiling water when the waterline falls below the top of zongzi.
After 2 ½ hours, turn off the heat, and take out the zongzi to let them cool. Serve the zongzi at room temperature with sugar or the syrup of your choice!",en-US,"{'calories': '229 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '42 g', 'proteinContent': '5 g', 'fatContent': '4 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '3 g', 'sodiumContent': '43 mg', 'fiberContent': '3 g', 'sugarContent': '7 g', 'servingSize': '1 serving'}",5.0,,The Woks of Life,360,15 serving(s)
Shrimp Fried Rice,Bill,https://thewoksoflife.com/shrimp-fried-rice/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/shrimp-fried-rice-2-1.jpg,"['2 cups uncooked jasmine rice', '1½ cups water', '1 tablespoon dark soy sauce', '2 teaspoons light soy sauce', '½ teaspoon turmeric', '3 tablespoons canola oil ((divided))', '2 eggs ((beaten))', '12 ounces shrimp ((340g, 51 to 60 size, peeled and deveined))', '1 medium onion ((diced))', '¼ teaspoon salt ((or to taste))', '¼ teaspoon sugar', '¼ teaspoon sesame oil', '¼ teaspoon ground white pepper', '1 cup snow peas ((chopped))', '1 scallion ((chopped))', '1 tablespoon Shaoxing wine']","First, wash the rice, and pour off the excess water. Combine the drained rice with 1 ½ cups water, the soy sauces and turmeric powder in a thick-bottomed pot or your rice cooker. Cook the rice per our instructions for perfect stovetop rice or press the button on your rice cooker! If you have not purchased a rice cooker yet and consider yourself a rice-lover, consider purchasing one! Check out our Chinese Cooking Tools page for more information and some useful links to products.
When the rice is cooked, fluff it with a fork or rice paddle. You will see that you now have a nice uniform golden brown rice. You can use this rice fresh or refrigerate it, and use it the next day. If you use cold refrigerated rice, you’ll have to break it up with your hands before cooking as well as add a sprinkling of water and cover your fried rice when cooking to heat it through.
Now onto the “fried” portion of this fried rice. Heat your wok over medium high heat. Add 1 tablespoon of oil, and add the eggs, scrambling them until they’re just cooked. Use your spatula to break up the large pieces into smaller chunks. You can start scooping them up when they look like they are almost done, and put them back into the same bowl you mixed them in. Set aside. You will cook them again in the rice.
Heat the wok until just smoking, and spread 1 tablespoon oil around the perimeter of the wok. Spread the shrimp out in a single layer, and let them sear for 20 seconds. Stir fry the shrimp until opaque, transfer them back to their bowl, and set aside. Again, they’ll get cooked again in the rice! For the record, when cooking large volumes of shrimp fried rice in restaurants, shrimp are usually pre-boiled (like they do for shrimp cocktail). Wok cooks then grab handfuls of the precooked shrimp for each order, which makes the process go quickly and smoothly, but at home, searing the shrimp definitely makes for better flavor!
With the wok over medium high heat, add the third tablespoon of oil, and sauté the onions until translucent.
Add the rice, using your metal spatula to flatten and break up any remaining clumps. If the rice is cold from the refrigerator, continue stir-frying until the rice is warmed up, which will take about 5 minutes, or sprinkle a tablespoon or two of water around the rice, lower the heat slightly, and cover for one minute to let the steam do some of the work.
Once the rice is warmed (this is very important or the sauce will not mix as well and the color of the rice will not be as uniform), add the salt, sugar, sesame oil, and freshly ground white pepper, and mix with a scooping motion until the rice is evenly coated with the seasonings. The rice should be hot by this time. Now add the shrimp and snow peas, and stir fry for another 30 seconds.
Add the eggs and scallions and continue stir-frying the rice for another 30 seconds. Gather all of the rice into the middle of the wok to let the sides of the wok heat up. After about 20 seconds, spread the Shaoxing wine around the perimeter of the wok, and stir-fry for another 20 seconds. This step gives that little extra wok hei that you taste when you get fried rice from a good Chinese restaurant!

Marinate the ribs with the mashed red fermented bean curd, the liquid from the jar, ½ teaspoon sugar, sesame oil, Shaoxing wine, ¼ teaspoon of ground white pepper, 1 tablespoon minced ginger, and the white parts of the scallions. Cover, and let sit in the refrigerator overnight.
Soak a large dried lotus leaf by submerging the whole leaf under water. Use a large plate or bowl to weigh it down and leave it overnight. Handle with care, since these leaves rip easily!
The next day, rinse and soak 2 cups of glutinous rice for an hour, making sure the water is at least 2 inches above the rice line. At the same time, take the marinated ribs out of the refrigerator and bring them to room temperature.
Rinse the lotus leaf front and back with fresh water. Line your bamboo steamer or large heatproof platter (with at least a 2-3 inch depth) with the lotus leaf.
Next, prepare the steamer with water. Make sure there is enough water in the steamer, but not so much that the water will flood the dish. You can always add boiling water if the water levels are low during steaming. Now cover the steamer and turn on the heat to bring the water to a boil.

Drain and set aside.
While the rice is soaking, blanch the lamb by boiling 4 cups of water in a pot along with the lamb and ginger. Let it boil for a couple of minutes, and then turn off the heat. Use a slotted spoon to pick out the lamb pieces and set them aside, making sure to drain off any excess water. Then use a fine mesh strainer to strain the cooking liquid. Reserve that liquid to cook the rice.
Now heat the oil in a wok over high heat. Add ONLY the fatty lamb pieces, and stir-fry to get a nice crust on them. Turn the heat down to medium low, and render the fat until the pieces start to turn golden brown, about 6 to 8 minutes.
Turn the heat to medium, and add the onion. Cook until the onion is translucent. Now turn the heat back up to high and add the blanched lamb in a single layer so as to brown the meat on all sides. This will take a few minutes. Add 2 1/2 cups of the cooking liquid you reserved earlier, along with the salt, soy sauce, and cumin, and mix everything well. Cover and simmer for 20 minutes.
Now add in the carrots and raisins (if using), and cover for another minute to bring the mixture back up to a boil. Turn off the heat. (Don’t worry, the carrots will finish cooking in the rice cooker. Also, at this point, the taste will be on the salty side, but remember that it will mellow up once mixed in with the rice.)
Pour everything into the rice cooker (or a pot), and add the rice. The rice should be spread out evenly. There should be enough liquid to see peeking through the rice grains (you may need to add more water if needed), but the liquid level should not be above the rice. Cover and start the rice cooker. If you are using a pot, turn the heat up to medium high to bring the mixture to a simmer, cover, turn the heat down to low, and cook for 15-20 minutes.

You can also refrigerate it the night before and when you're ready to use it the next day, rinse your hands in water and carefully break up the clumps of rice. The water should prevent or minimize the rice sticking to your hands.
Heat your wok until it just begins to smoke and add 1 tablespoon oil. Throw in the scallops and sear (without moving them) 60 seconds until they get some good color. Toss them around until they're just opaque and set aside on a plate. Beat the eggs with shaoxing wine and salt and set aside.
Wash and dry your wok and heat it over low heat, with 2 tablespoons oil. Add the garlic and spread it around evenly. Let the garlic fry very slowly until they just turn golden. If it goes brown, it's already burned and bitter, so keep a constant watch on it! It should take about 5 minutes for the garlic to get crispy and just start to turn light golden. When they are ready, transfer the crispy garlic to a paper towel to drain and set aside.
Leave the infused oil from the garlic in the wok, and raise the heat to medium high. Add the diced onions and stir-fry until translucent. Add in the rice to the onion mixture, and then pour the egg mixture evenly over all the rice. Immediately begin stirring constantly in a scoop and lift motion. This will leave all your rice coated in a thin layer of scrambled egg. After about 90 seconds of stirring, mix in the XO sauce.

Brown rice is easy to cook. We have detailed instructions in our post on How to Make Perfect Brown Rice, either on the stove, or in any rice cooker.
If you are making brown rice fresh the same day, let the cooked rice cool completely before using it. It’s best to transfer the rice from the pot to a sheet pan and fluff it with a fork, so it can dry out and cool simultaneously.
Day-old brown rice also works nicely, as cold rice clumps are drier and easily broken apart in the wok. Simply take the brown rice out of the refrigerator, wet your hands with a little water, and break up any clumps so you have individual rice grains. Rinse your hands with a little more water if rice sticks to your hands.
Marinate the meat
If using beef, chicken, or pork, add 1 tablespoon water, 1¼ teaspoons dark mushroom soy sauce, and 1 teaspoon vegetable oil to the meat. Mix until all the liquid is absorbed by the meat to tenderize and add moisture. If you’re using shrimp, just omit the dark mushroom soy sauce.
Next, mix in 1 teaspoon cornstarch and set aside. We made a version with beef, but you can pick any meat of your choosing or go vegetarian with a vegetable fried brown rice.
Prepare sauce
Mixing your sauce ahead of time is much easier than adding everything individually to a hot wok. In a small bowl, mix 2 teaspoons hot water and ¼ teaspoon granulated sugar until dissolved. Stir in ⅛ teaspoon ground white pepper, ½ teaspoon sesame oil, 1 teaspoon dark soy sauce, 1 tablespoon light soy sauce, and ½ teaspoon MSG if using. Set aside.
Scramble eggs
Heat the wok until just smoking. Spread two tablespoons of vegetable oil evenly around the wok, and add the beaten eggs. Turn the heat down and stir the eggs until scrambled. Transfer back to the same bowl, and set aside.
Sear meat
Heat the wok until smoking. Add one tablespoon of vegetable oil. Add the marinated meat to the wok. Spread it out in one single layer, and sear for 30 seconds on each side. Scoop it back into the bowl and set aside.
Stir-fry everything together
With the heat on high, add the chopped onions to the wok (there should be some oil remaining from searing the meat). Cook until translucent. If using fresh carrots, add them at the same time you add the onions. If using frozen carrots, add them after the onions turn translucent.Continue stir frying until the carrots are heated through.
Add the cooked brown rice. Your heat should be really high at this point to prevent sticking. Use your metal wok spatula to stir-fry the rice, scraping from the bottom of the wok to prevent sticking. This is an essential technique for fried rice.
Once the brown rice is warmed (after 1 to 2 minutes of stir-frying), pour the prepared sauce evenly over the rice. Stir fry for another 1-2 minutes to evenly distribute the sauce.
Add in the seared meat. Spread 1 tablespoon of Shaoxing wine around the perimeter of the wok, and give everything a quick stir.
Next, stir in the scrambled eggs. Then, stir in the frozen peas until heated through. Toss in the chopped scallions and stir fry for another 15 seconds. Use a clean spoon to taste the rice, and re-season with more soy sauce or salt if needed.

Set aside. (We added a bit of water to marinate the beef, which generally is a no-no for beef...but for this fried rice dish, it keeps the small morsels of beef juicy and tender!)
Next, combine the hot water, sugar, sesame oil, soy sauces, MSG (if using), and white pepper in a small bowl. This is the sauce that you’ll be adding to the rice, and it’s much easier to have it combined and ready to go before you start cooking.
Take your cooked rice and fluff it with a fork or with your hands (you can rinse your hands in cold water if the rice starts sticking to them). If you are using cold leftover rice, try to break up the clumps as best as possible.
Heat your wok over medium high heat, add 1 tablespoon of oil and the eggs, and scramble them until just cooked. You can start scooping them up when they look like they are almost done. Transfer them back into the same bowl you mixed them in and set aside. They will continue to cook in the bowl and you will cook them again in the rice.
Heat the wok until just smoking and spread 1 tablespoon oil around your wok. Add the marinated beef in one layer, and let sear for 20 seconds. Next, stir fry the beef until about 70% done. Transfer the beef back to the marinade bowl, and set aside.
With the wok over medium high heat, add the last tablespoon of oil, and sauté the onions until translucent, about 2 minutes. Add the rice, using a metal spatula to flatten out and break up any large clumps. If the rice is cold from the refrigerator, continue stir-frying until the rice is warmed up, about 5 minutes. Also, sprinkling a little water on large clumps of rice will help break them up more easily.
Once the rice is warmed through, add the sauce mixture. Stir the rice with a scooping motion until the grains are evenly coated with sauce. The rice should be completely hot by now. Next, add the beef and any juices from the bowl you set aside earlier, and stir fry for another minute.
Add the eggs, breaking up any large clumps, peas, and the scallions. Continue stir-frying for another 30 seconds. Push the rice into the middle of the wok to let the perimeter of the wok heat up. After about 20 seconds, pour 1 tablespoon of Shaoxing wine around the perimeter of the wok. Stir-fry for another 20 seconds. Adding the wine using this method gives the dish a little extra wok hei! At this point, taste the rice to see if it needs a little more salt, soy sauce, or white pepper and season accordingly.

We used instant dashi, but if you want to make it yourself, we have detailed instructions in our Miso Soup recipe. At this point, you can also cook the rice you’ll serve with the tempura.
Next, prepare the vegetables, making sure everything is washed and trimmed. Nothing should be too wet ahead of frying, so if needed, pat the vegetables with a kitchen towel or let them sit at room temperature to dry off while you prep everything else.
Score the shrimp with a sharp knife so that they can lay flat (you can do this lightly if you don’t mind them retaining some of their curved shape). Refrigerate the shrimp until you’re ready to fry.
Next, make the batter. Stir together the ice water, cake flour, and egg yolks. No need to get rid of all the lumps—in fact, take care not to overmix it. Pop it in the refrigerator while you heat the frying oil.
In a small deep pot, heat enough oil to fill it about halfway, over medium-high heat. While that’s happening, set up a wire rack over a sheet pan or a platter lined with paper towels. When a drop of the batter sizzles vigorously but doesn’t brown too quickly, you’re ready to go.
To fry, swirl one piece of vegetable or shrimp in the batter (for the shrimp, hold it by the tail), and lower it gently into the batter. Fry everything in batches of 3-4 items for 45-90 seconds, turning each item 3-4 times. When the vegetables are lightly golden and the shrimp are lightly golden, orange, and floating, it’s ready to be transferred to the wire rack.
Adjust the heat as needed between batches as you add cold food to the oil. The oil should be hot enough that it doesn’t take too long to cook the tempura, but not so hot that the food immediately turns golden when it hits the oil.

Stir well to combine everything, level out the rice, and create a crater in the center.
Tightly cover the bowl with clear plastic wrap, place it in a warm place in the house to start the fermentation process, and check it daily!
The fermentation process will be complete when the liquid or resulting rice wine is at the same level as the rice. Also, the rice will look mushy and joined together as one mass. Visible bubbles in the rice wine is normal. When you can detect all of these signs, it’s time to lift the cover and have a taste using a clean spoon, please do not cross contaminate. Liquid should taste sweet with a wine-like aroma and the rice should have the texture of cooked oatmeal.
Transfer to the fridge immediately to stop any additional fermentation. Your fermented rice will last for 1-2 months in the refrigerator.
One important note: this sweet fermented rice recipe is very sweet and very low in alcohol levels, so it’s okay for all ages, but NOT necessarily for everyone depending on your health conditions.

Next, heat a pan with 1 tablespoon of oil over medium-high heat. Stir-fry the carrots for about 1 minute, sprinkling with a pinch of salt. Transfer to a bowl and set aside.
Next, stir fry the bean sprouts using the same method as with the carrots.
Next prep your watercress. Cut each bunch in half and wash thoroughly.
In the same pan you used for the carrots, heat 2 tablespoons of oil over medium high heat. Add the garlic and let fry gently for about 15-20 seconds. Add the watercress, followed by a ½ teaspoon of salt, and stir-fry until completely wilted. Remove from the heat and toss with the soy sauce, sesame seeds, and sesame oil. Set aside.
Now for the salmon. Sprinkle with salt and pepper on both sides. Heat a pan over medium high heat with 3 tablespoons of oil. Add the salmon. Let brown for about 5 minutes. Flip, and let the other side cook for another 5 minutes. Our salmon steak was pretty thick, so cooking time may need to be adjusted depending on how big your piece of salmon is. When in doubt, just use a knife to gently cut into the center to check for doneness. Looks don't matter with this dish, as we'll be flaking the salmon anyway.
While the salmon is cooking, set aside the kimchi and seaweed flakes, cutting up the seaweed with kitchen shears if you're using roasted sheets. Also, cook one egg for each person you're serving.
When the salmon is finished cooking, you're ready to assemble your bibimbap.
Spoon a nice bed of rice into a bowl and top with a small handful of flaked salmon and your egg. Add as much watercress, carrot, bean sprouts, kimchi, and seaweed as your heart desires.

Take your rice out of the refrigerator. Wet your hands, and break up any clumps with your fingers. Set aside on the counter for 1 hour, so the rice can come up to room temperature.

After the rice is cooked, leave it out to cool uncovered for 5 minutes. Fluff the rice with chopsticks or a fork, and turn it out onto a large plate or sheet pan to cool further and dry out slightly. If you cooked the rice properly, you should be able to see individual grains of rice that aren’t too wet.
Prepare vegetables:
Dice and chop all of your vegetables, including the onion, carrots, mushrooms, bell pepper, snow peas, and scallions, ensuring they’re all about the same size. The exception is the mung bean sprouts, which just need to be rinsed, cleaned and trimmed. Set the vegetables aside in neat piles.
Prepare eggs:
Combine the eggs with salt, white pepper, and Shaoxing wine. Beat for 30 seconds.
Heat your wok until it just begins to smoke, and add 2 tablespoons of neutral oil to coat the wok. Pour in the beaten eggs. Scramble them, and when they’re about halfway done, turn off the heat. Use your wok spatula to break the eggs up into smaller pieces, using the residual heat of the wok to just cook them through. Remove from the wok and set aside.

Carefully arrange the eggs in the container they’ll be brined in. Add enough water to cover the eggs so they are completely submerged. This step is to find out how much water you need, so do not discard the water.
Carefully remove the eggs from the water, and let them sunbathe for 3-4 hours in the early morning sun; reduce the sunbathing time to 1-2 hours if the temperature is higher than 65F, but it should still be early morning sun! Turn the eggs every hour. The late morning hot sun may result in cracked eggs during the salting process.
Meanwhile, transfer the water in the container to a clean pot—I used about 1 quart of water (if you’re using aromatics, it’s time to add them now!). Stir in ¼ cup salt and bring to a boil. Turn off the heat, cover, and cool completely to room temperature. In the meantime, take the container, and let it dry out completely in the sun.
Pour ½ cup of Chinese baijiu (or whiskey) into a large bowl, carefully take the eggs, and turn them over in the baijiu. ½ cup of baijiu isn’t enough to submerge them, so you’ll have to roll them around every 10 minutes so they are soaking at all times. Soak the eggs in the baijiu for 1 hour.
Once the salt water is completely cooled and your container is dry, add the eggs back to the glass container one by one. Pour in the baijiu used to soak the eggs along with the cooled salt water. Arrange the eggs with a clean utensil to make sure they are all completely submerged.
Cover tightly so that the container is thoroughly sealed, and store in a cool, dry place for 30 to 60 days. Egg sizes vary, so brining time will vary as well. You can cook one after 30 days to see if it’s done. Try again in 10-15 days if it's not quite there!

Mix all of the ingredients into the beef. Set aside for 10 minutes.
Combine warmed beef stock or water with 2 tablespoons soy sauce, 1 teaspoon dark soy sauce, 2 tablespoons oyster sauce, ½ teaspoon sesame oil, ½ teaspoon salt, ¼ teaspoon sugar and 1/8 teaspoon ground white pepper. Use pure beef stock only. Many are made with celery, tomato, and carrot, which will make this stir-fry taste like beef stew! If you can’t find a purer stock, use water and/or a beef bullion cube. Just remember to adjust the seasoning accordingly, as they can be salty. You can add more water and cornstarch slurry to offset this effect.
Heat your carbon steel wok until it’s just smoking. Spread 2 tablespoons oil around the perimeter, and add the beef.
Use your wok spatula to spread the beef out, and sear for 30 seconds. Stir-fry the beef for another 30 seconds until it’s 80% done, and transfer the beef back to the bowl.
Without washing the wok, turn the heat back on to medium. Add 1 tablespoon of oil to the wok, and immediately add the ginger, white portion of the scallions and garlic. Stir-fry for 15 seconds, and add the mushrooms.
Next spread 1½ tablespoons of Shaoxing wine around the perimeter of the wok to deglaze, and stir-fry everything for 20 seconds.
Add the stock and sauces to the wok, and bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally to deglaze the wok and heat the sauce. Once the mixture starts to simmer, add the beef and any juices from the bowl along with the rest of the scallions. Stir-fry everything to combine.
Immediately stir up your cornstarch slurry (the water and cornstarch has likely separated by now). Slowly drizzle about two thirds of the slurry into the sauce while stirring.
Within 10 seconds, you should see the sauce thicken. Add more cornstarch slurry if you like your sauce thicker, or add more stock or water if the sauce is too thick. (Remember your sauce will thicken slightly as it cools.) Either way, move quickly during this step so you don’t overcook your beef.

Lobster Sticky Fried Rice,Bill,https://thewoksoflife.com/lobster-sticky-fried-rice/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/lobster-sticky-rice-13-1.jpg,"['2 whole live lobsters ((1¼ to 1½ pounds each))', '1 tablespoon all-purpose flour', '2 tablespoons cornstarch', '1½ cups sticky rice ((300g, also called sweet rice, soaked in 2 cups water for 30 minutes to 1 hour))', '2 cups vegetable oil ((for frying))', '2 eggs ((whites separated from the yolks))', '6 cloves garlic ((coarsely chopped))', '1 teaspoon ginger ((finely chopped))', '2 ounces Jinhua ham ((finely chopped, or any other dry cured ham))', '½ cup red onion ((diced))', '2 teaspoons Shaoxing wine', '¼ teaspoon salt ((or to taste))', '1 teaspoon dark soy sauce', '1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper', '¾ cup scallions ((finely chopped with white and green parts separated))']","Prep the lobster by dispatching them and cutting them into bite sized pieces.
Next, put the lobster pieces in a large bowl. Mix the flour and cornstarch together in a bowl and sprinkle it over the lobster. Toss until all the lobster is lightly coated.
Add the sticky rice (after soaking and draining) to a pot of 8 cups of boiling water and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Strain into a colander and give it quick rinse with cool water, and set aside to drain. Use a fork to break the rice up a bit before you add it to the wok to make the stir frying easier.
Heat 2 cups of oil in your wok over medium high heat. When little bubbles form around a bamboo or wooden chopstick dipped in the oil, it’s hot enough! Beat the egg yolks, and drizzle them into the oil to fry. They’ll cook quickly, be ready to immediately pick out the egg using a fine meshed strainer, and set aside.
Using the fine-mesh strainer, make sure there are no egg debris in your frying oil. Turn the heat down to low and fry the garlic at a low temperature (200F), until it’s light golden brown in color. Transfer to a dish using your fine-meshed strainer and set aside.
Now crank up the heat to medium high. When the oil reaches about 375 to 380 degrees F or until *just* smoking, fry the lobster in batches for 30 to 60 seconds for each batch, gently moving the lobster around with your metal wok spatula or until the shells just turn pink. Make sure the lobster is cooked, but not overcooked, or it will be rubbery! You must also let the oil come back up to temperature after each batch since the cold lobster cools down the hot oil significantly.
Drain the lobster pieces of excess oil using a spider or steel strainer and set aside in a large bowl. You can also move them to a wire rack to drain further. You will have leftover oil from frying the lobster, egg yolk and garlic. Pour the oil through a fine mesh strainer into a heatproof bowl. We’ll use some of this for the fried rice, but for the rest, let it cool, refrigerate it, and use it for cooking other recipes! The infused flavors will add good umami to other dishes, and it’s what many restaurants do!
Now it’s time to bring all these elements together. If your wok is on the smaller side, you may want to cook the sticky rice in two batches!
Add 1 tablespoon of the frying oil to the wok set over medium-low heat, and add the chopped ginger. Gently caramelize the ginger, taking extra care not to burn it.
Next, add the Jinhua ham, and let it fry for 30 seconds. You can use dry-cured Virginia ham as a substitute for the Jinhua ham, which is much harder to find! Next, add the chopped red onion, and stir fry for 30 seconds, or until fragrant and just softened.
Add the par-boiled sticky rice and stir-fry for 2 minutes or until reheated. Beat the egg whites with a fork until frothy and pour on top of the rice. Continue stir-frying for another 1 to 2 minutes, or until the rice is coated in the egg white.
Spread the Shaoxing wine around the perimeter of the wok, and add the salt and dark soy sauce. Stir fry until combined, and add the fried egg yolks, the white pepper, and the white parts of the scallions,
Next, add the lobster and any juices from the bowl, and gently fold the lobster into the rice using your wok spatula until well combined. Then add half of the fried garlic and the green parts of the scallions.

If you don’t have a rice cooker, follow our instructions for making rice without a rice cooker. Then put a medium pot of water on the stove, and bring to a boil.
While the rice is going and your water is heating up, prepare your vegetables. Wash the bean sprouts and watercress, and then julienne the carrot. While you have the chopping board out, mince the garlic.
By now, your water should be boiling. Blanch the bean sprouts for about 5 minutes, and remove with a slotted spoon to a colander to drain. Then add the watercress to the same pot of boiling water, and blanch for 1 minute. Set aside in another colander to drain.
Rinse both the bean sprouts and the greens under cold running water to stop the cooking process, and then thoroughly squeeze out any excess water from both sets of vegetables. Transfer the bean sprouts to a medium bowl. Roll the watercress into a cigar and slice 3 or 4 times to create shorter strands of vegetable. Set aside in a separate bowl. Season each bowl (the bean sprouts and the greens) with salt to taste and a teaspoon of sesame oil. Divide the minced garlic between the two bowls, and toss to combine. Set aside.
In a skillet over medium high heat, add a tablespoon of canola oil along with the julienned carrots. Stir-fry the carrots until tender but still a little crunchy, about 1 minute. Remove from the pan and set aside.
Turn up the heat to high. Add the ground beef to the pan, and brown, breaking up the beef into smaller pieces. Stir in the soy sauce. Meanwhile, in a separate skillet, cook the eggs sunny side up, leaving the yolks runny.

Now, soak the glutinous rice in a bowl covered with at least an inch of water above the rice for about 2 hours. While the rice is soaking, prepare the meat filling.
Weigh about 13 ounces of lean pork and 3 ounces of pork fat. You can use the techniques from our post on How to Grind Meat without a Meat Grinder in Minutes, and hand-chop the pork very finely. It’s also fine to use store-bought ground pork, but make sure it’s 80% lean. In a large bowl, add the ground pork, water chestnuts, ginger, the scallions, water, Shaoxing wine, cornstarch, white pepper, sesame oil, sea salt, and sugar.
Stir to combine everything well, whipping in just *one* direction for at least 5 minutes until the filling becomes fluffy and sticky. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. While the meat is marinating, prepare the steamer. Wash and trim the bamboo leaves, and use them to line the steamer.
After 2 hours of soaking, drain the glutinous rice, and do your best to shake off any excess water.
Remove the meat filling from the fridge after the 30 minutes has elapsed. Now it’s time to make the pearls! Take about a tablespoon of meat filling, form a ball and roll it in the glutinous rice so that the whole surface is coated. Roll it between your palms lightly to ensure all the glutinous rice adheres to the meatball. Position the meatballs on the bamboo leaf with about ½ an inch of space in between each meatball.
To cook, start with cold water with the steamer covered. Steam over high heat for 20 minutes. After steaming, turn off the heat, and let the meatballs sit with the cover on for 3 additional minutes before removing the lid and serving.",en-US,"{'calories': '188 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '13 g', 'proteinContent': '9 g', 'fatContent': '10 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '4 g', 'cholesterolContent': '33 mg', 'sodiumContent': '260 mg', 'fiberContent': '1 g', 'sugarContent': '1 g', 'servingSize': '1 serving'}",4.8,,The Woks of Life,505,10 serving(s)
Youtiao Recipe (Chinese Fried Dough),Judy,https://thewoksoflife.com/youtiao-recipe/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/youtiao-11-1.jpg,"['2 cups all-purpose flour', '1 egg', '1/2 teaspoon salt', '1½ teaspoons baking powder', '1 tablespoon milk', '2 tablespoons unsalted butter ((softened, NOT MELTED))', 'about 1/3 cup water', 'oil ((for frying))']","Using your electric mixer with the dough hook attachment, first mix the flour, egg, salt, baking powder, milk, and softened butter together on the lowest setting. Keeping the speed at “stir,” slowly add the water in a few separate batches (you may need more or less depending on the humidity in your kitchen).
Knead the dough for 15 minutes. The dough should be sticky, but not stick to the sides of the bowl. Cover the dough, and let rest for 30 minutes. This can be done by hand if you don’t have a mixer. Just knead the dough for 5-10 minutes longer.
On a clean, lightly floured surface, form the dough into a long flat loaf shape, about 1/4-inch thick and 4 inches wide. Take the time to make it truly uniform. Place it in the center of a large piece of plastic wrap on a baking sheet or long, flat plate. Wrap the dough, tucking the two ends of the plastic under the loaf, and ensuring that the dough is completely covered. Refrigerate overnight.
In the morning, take out the dough and let it sit on the counter (wrapped) for 1-3 hours until the dough is completely back to room temperature and VERY, VERY soft to the touch. This step is critical, and may take longer in the colder months. If you don't let the dough come back to room temperature, it won't fry up properly.
Now prepare the oil for frying using your wok. You can also use a large pan with some depth for added safety. The goal is to have a large vessel, so that you can produce authentically long crullers. Use medium heat to slowly bring the oil up to 400-425°F/205-220°C.
While the oil is heating up, you can unwrap the dough. Gently flip the dough onto a lightly floured surface, peeling off the plastic wrap. Very lightly flour the top side of the dough also. Next, cut the dough into 1-inch wide strips (try to cut an even number of strips). Then stack them two by two, and press the center, lengthwise, with a chopstick. Hold the two ends of each piece, and gently stretch the dough to a 9-inch long rope.
Once the oil is up to temperature, carefully lower the stretched dough into the oil. If the oil temperature is right, the dough should surface right away. Now take a long cooking tool (we used chopsticks, but you could also use tongs), and quickly roll the dough in a continuous motion for about a minute.
You can fry one to two at a time. Just be sure to take the time to continuously roll the dough in the oil. The youtiao is done once they turn light golden brown. Try not to over-fry them as they become unpleasantly crunchy rather than chewy and delicious.
Now, repeat those steps with the remaining dough. You might want two people manning the process—one to form and place the dough into the fryer and one to roll the dough around once it’s in the oil.",en-US,"{'calories': '178 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '19 g', 'proteinContent': '3 g', 'fatContent': '10 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '2 g', 'cholesterolContent': '23 mg', 'sodiumContent': '144 mg', 'fiberContent': '1 g', 'sugarContent': '1 g', 'servingSize': '1 serving'}",4.88,,The Woks of Life,740,10 serving(s)
Sticky Rice Mushroom Shumai w/ Homemade Wrappers (Vegan),Judy,https://thewoksoflife.com/sticky-rice-mushroom-shumai-w-homemade-wrappers-vegan/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/sticky-rice-shumai-9-1.jpg,"['2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour ((plus extra for dusting))', '1/2 teaspoon salt', '3/4 cup boiling water', '2 cups uncooked sticky rice ((aka sweet rice, glutinous rice))', '1 tablespoon oil', '15 dried shiitake mushrooms ((cleaned, soaked in warm water until softened, and diced))', '2 shallots ((minced))', '2 scallions ((chopped))', '1 tablespoon shaoxing wine', '1 teaspoon salt', '2 teaspoons soy sauce', '1 teaspoon mushroom soy sauce ((dark soy sauce))', '1/8 teaspoon five-spice powder', '1/2 teaspoon sesame oil', '1/4 cup warm water', '3/4 cup frozen peas']","Start by making the dough. Mix the flour, salt and boiling water together in a mixing bowl, handle with care and knead until you get a smooth dough. Put in a bowl covered with a damp towel, and let the dough rest for 1-2 hours. You can also cover it tightly and let it rest in the refrigerator overnight if you want to make it ahead of time.
To make the filling, cook the sticky rice. You can either steam it (full instructions on how to pre-cook sticky rice using a soaking and steaming method here) or follow your rice cooker's instructions if it has a special setting for sticky rice. Heat the oil in a wok over medium heat, and add the mushrooms and shallots. Stir-fry for a few minutes, until the shallots are translucent. Add the scallions, shaoxing wine, salt, soy sauces, five spice powder, sesame oil, and water. Cook for another minute. Stir in the cooked rice and peas. Turn off the heat.
Divide the dough into four pieces. Working one piece at a time (cover the rest of the dough with a damp cloth to prevent it from drying out), roll the dough into a long rope and cut it into small pieces about the size of an acorn. This method is similar to the one we used for dumpling wrappers.
To assemble the shumai, first prepare the steamer, lining it with a layer of damp cheese cloth, or by brushing it with oil to prevent sticking.
Dust a clean surface with flour and roll out each piece of dough into a small circle about 3.5 inches in diameter. No worries if it’s not perfect. In this case, uneven edges are encouraged. They’ll give you a nice ruffled edge when assembled.
Place a bit of the sticky rice mixture in the middle, and squeeze the wrapper around it to form the shape you want. Place them in the steamer about an inch apart.
Steam the shumai for about 5 minutes and serve immediately with the dipping sauce of your choice!",en-US,"{'calories': '476 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '97 g', 'proteinContent': '11 g', 'fatContent': '4 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '1 g', 'sodiumContent': '759 mg', 'fiberContent': '5 g', 'sugarContent': '2 g', 'servingSize': '1 serving'}",4.5,,The Woks of Life,75,6 serving(s)

If using fresh pineapple, remember to trim away the pineapple core. If using canned pineapple, rinse away any syrup and pat dry with a clean kitchen towel.
Beat 2 eggs with ¼ teaspoon salt and ½ teaspoon Shaoxing wine. Heat your wok over medium heat until lightly smoking. Add 1 tablespoon oil, and scramble the eggs for 1 minute—until just cooked. Turn off the heat, break the egg into small pieces, transfer to a dish, and set aside.
Heat another 1 tablespoon of oil over medium heat. Cook the shrimp until they turn pink, about 1 minute. Remove from the wok and set aside.
Heat the last 2 tablespoons of oil over medium heat. Cook the onion until translucent. Add the diced carrots and ham, and cook until the carrots are no longer crunchy. Add the rice and 1 tablespoon Shaoxing wine. The steam from the wine will loosen the rice chunks!
Stir-fry everything together well, and add in the peas, 1 tablespoon fish sauce, 1 tablespoon light soy sauce, ½ teaspoon ground white pepper, 1 teaspoon sesame oil, the scrambled egg, and the cooked shrimp. Stir-fry everything together for a few minutes.
Finally, add the pineapple and scallions. Mix everything again for a minute or two. To crisp and warm the rice through, you can use your wok spatula to spread the rice in a single layer around the surface area of the wok, making use of all the heat and letting any excess liquid evaporate.

If using fresh mushrooms, just dice them.
Rinse the pork belly and pad it dry. Cut the pork into 1/2"" x 1/2"" cubes.
Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in wok over medium heat. Cook the minced ginger until lightly browned. Add the pork belly, and turn up the heat, stir-frying until the pork is lightly browned around the edges. Add the mushrooms and stir-fry for another two minutes.

Wash the pork belly and pat it dry with paper towels. Slice it into ¼-inch thick pieces. In a large bowl, mix the sliced pork belly with the minced ginger, Shaoxing wine, fermented bean curd, spicy bean sauce, five spice powder, and sugar. Use your hands to combine everything together well. Cover and marinate for about 1 hour in the refrigerator.
While the pork is marinating, prepare the rice mixture. In a clean, dry wok over medium-low heat, add the long grain rice, sweet rice, Sichuan peppercorns, and the star anise. Cook it for about 5 minutes until the rice turns a light brown color. After 5 minutes, turn off the heat, and let the mixture cool slightly. Next, use a food processor or mortar and pestle to mill the mixture into a coarse grind. When using the food processor, pulse the mixture a couple of times. The rice shouldn’t be too finely ground.
It’s also a great idea to double or triple the rice mixture, and store the leftovers in the refrigerator, so it’s readily available if and when you want to make this dish again. The rice mixture should last a few months in the fridge.
Next, we’ll assemble and cook the dish. Peel the taro skin, rinse, and cut it into pieces roughly the same size as the pork belly pieces. Add the taro to the marinated pork. In a different bowl, mix the ground rice mixture with ½ cup water to create a thick paste. Then combine the rice paste with the marinated pork belly, taro, and 2 teaspoons of light soy sauce. Transfer the mixture to a heat-resistant bowl or casserole dish that will fit into a steamer. Remember that the ground rice will expand after steaming, so make sure the dish is big enough. You can arrange the dish neatly like I did, or not--it won’t affect the taste!
Prepare your steamer, filling it with 2-3 quarts of water. Set the dish in the steamer, and cover it tightly with the lid. Bring the water to a boil using high heat, then turn the heat down to medium low, and steam the pork and taro for 70 to 90 minutes.

Cantonese-Style Zongzi (Rice Dumplings),Judy,https://thewoksoflife.com/zongzi-cantonese-style/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/zongzi-26-1.jpg,"['36 to 40 dried bamboo leaves ((2 to 3 leaves per zongzi))', '5 cups uncooked short grain sticky rice ((also called glutinous rice, or ""sweet rice""))', '2 tablespoons light soy sauce ((plus 2 teaspoons))', '2 teaspoons salt ((plus 1/2 teaspoon))', '2/3 cup raw peanuts', '1 pound pork belly ((450g, cut into 12 equal pieces))', '1/2 teaspoon sugar', '2 teaspoons shaoxing wine', '1/2 teaspoon ground white pepper', '1 teaspoon oil', '½ cup water', '6 salted duck egg yolks', '3 Chinese sausages']","First, soak the leaves overnight. The next day, wash and rinse each leaf front and back, keeping them in a large bowl or tub of water until wrapping time so they don’t dry out.
Soak the sweet rice overnight. The next day, drain completely. Mix the soaked, uncooked rice with 2 tablespoons light soy sauce and 2 teaspoons salt in a large bowl and set aside.
Soak the peanuts overnight. The next day, boil for 5 minutes, drain, and set aside.
In a bowl, toss the pork belly with 2 teaspoons light soy sauce, 1/2 teaspoons sugar, 2 teaspoons shaoxing wine, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and white pepper. Marinate overnight. The goal of this step is to make the pork belly slightly too salty, because the rice will absorb the excess salt, giving the zongzi its distinctive savory, umami flavor.
The next day, heat the oil in a wok over medium heat. Cook the pork belly for a few minutes before adding the water. Cover the wok with the lid, and cook for 5-10 minutes until the liquid is gone. Remove from the wok and let cool.
Cut the egg yolks in half. Cut the sausages into 12 equal pieces. Set aside in separate bowls.
Follow the step-by-step photos to wrap the zongzi. Remember: You must cut away at least half an inch off the bottom of every leaf you use. Make sure the kitchen twine won’t break easily. To do this, it’s best to wet the twine first by soaking it in a bowl of water. It’s best to tie one end of the twine to an anchor point or kitchen fixture (e.g. you kitchen sink), because you will only have one hand to tie the zongzi. Your other hand will be holding the zongzi. Or have someone help you out! If leaves rip anywhere during the wrapping process, you’ll need to start over and discard the ripped leaf. That’s why I call for more leaves than is technically needed. Some of the leaves are bound to rip.
To cook the Zongzi, get a medium-sized pot and neatly nest the zongzi inside, avoiding large gaps. Put a large plate directly on top of the zongzi to weigh them down. Fill the pot with cold water, until the zongzi are submerged. Place the pot on the stove over medium high heat. Once the water boils, turn the heat to low/medium-low, and let it simmer for at least 7-8 hours.
The water should be “moving” while simmering, but there should be no large roiling bubbles. You must check the pot fairly often to make sure the zongzi are always submerged in water. Only add boiling water to adjust the water level—do not add room temperature or cold water. Keep a kettle of hot water on the stove so that you’re prepared throughout the 7-8 hour cooking time.
Once the 7-8 hours is up, eat the zongzi while they’re hot! Sweet zongzi can be enjoyed at room temperature, but savory zongzi are really the best when they’re steamy and delicious.",en-US,"{'calories': '497 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '52 g', 'proteinContent': '13 g', 'fatContent': '28 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '9 g', 'cholesterolContent': '116 mg', 'sodiumContent': '607 mg', 'fiberContent': '2 g', 'sugarContent': '1 g', 'servingSize': '1 serving'}",4.67,,The Woks of Life,1920,15 serving(s)

Prep the beaten eggs as well and set them aside. Only when you have all the ingredients prepared and ready to go should you start cooking.
Heat the cooking oil in a wok over medium-high heat. Add the ginger first, stirring for 30 seconds. Then add the garlic. When the garlic is just cooked (before it starts to turn golden), add the cooked rice to the wok, and turn up the heat to high. Stir fry the rice for 3 minutes or so until it's thoroughly combined with the ginger/garlic mixture and/or warmed through if you're using leftover rice.
Now for the flavorings: add the white pepper, fish sauce, soy sauce, and shaoxing wine to the rice. If it's not quite salty enough for you or if you know you won't be eating it with added hot sauce, now is the time to add salt to taste. Stir-fry to combine.
Using your spatula, spread the rice out into an even layer along the surface of the wok. Pour the beaten egg evenly over the rice. Stir the rice until all of the egg is cooked and incorporated. The egg coats the rice and makes for a most excellent savory experience. Much better than broken up bits/huge chunks of scrambled egg throughout.
Before adding the crab, use your spatula to once more spread the rice evenly in the wok. Add the crab to the rice and stir fry thoroughly.

They should be completely submerged. In a large container, soak the glutinous rice in water, making sure the water level is 3-4 inches above the rice, as it will expand considerably as it soaks. Cut the pork belly into 1-inch x 2-inch chunks. Combine the pork with all the marinade ingredients except the water (the light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, salt, sugar, Shaoxing wine, white pepper, and five-spice powder), and mix everything well. It may seem like a lot of salt, but the rice will absorb the saltiness during the cooking process. If there is no visible liquid after mixing, add water, 2 tablespoons at a time. Pork can soak up a lot of liquid and the liquid will help to keep it moist. The pork marinade should be wet, but without too much liquid pooling at the bottom.
The next day: Completely drain the rice using a fine-meshed colander or sieve. Mix in the rice marinade ingredients (the light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, sugar, and salt), and mix everything well. Set aside, and marinate for about 30 minutes. In the meantime, wash each leaf front and back with a soft cloth, and rinse. Transfer them to a bowl of fresh water until you’re ready to wrap the zongzi so they don’t dry out. Lay out all the components: the pork, the rice, zongzi leaves, and kitchen twine. Now you’re ready to start wrapping zongzi! Follow the step-by-step photos on how to wrap them. There will be visible sauce at the bottom of the rice when you get to the end, simply drain it out once you start to see this, as you don’t want any excess liquid in the zongzi.
To cook the zongzi, neatly and tightly nest all the zongzi in a large soup pot. Ideally, there will be no visible gaps. If necessary, put a large heatproof plate directly on top of the zongzi to weigh them down. Fill the pot with cold water until they are completely submerged. Place the pot on the stove over high heat. Once the water boils, turn the heat to medium-low, and let it simmer for at least 4-5 hours.

With all fried rice recipes, it's best to use a little bit less water so as to prevent producing a mushy, sticky rice mess that you will not be able to stir-fry properly! After the rice is done, let it cool uncovered. When the steam stops wafting off the fresh-cooked rice, use a fork to fluff the rice up and break it apart. Don’t worry of there are still clumps – you can deal with those in the wok later.
If you refrigerate the rice overnight, it will definitely clump; you can easily break up the cold rice clumps into individual grains with your hands. Just rinse your hands with cold water periodically if they get too sticky during the process.
Heat the wok over medium high heat, and add 1 tablespoon of oil, followed by the beaten eggs. Fold and scramble them gently, taking care not to scorch the eggs. Transfer the eggs back into the original egg bowl and set aside. In a pot of boiling water, blanch the shrimp and drain. Set aside.
Heat the wok now over high heat. Add 2 tablespoons of oil and the diced onion. Stir-fry until the onions are translucent. Next, add the diced ham and pork, and stir-fry for 30 seconds. Add the rice and stir-fry for 2 minutes, being sure to heat the rice uniformly. Use your wok spatula to flatten out and break up any remaining rice clumps. Add the shrimp and peas, and stir fry continuously for another 2 minutes until the rice is heated through.
Next sprinkle the salt and sugar over the rice. If using, drizzle the Shaoxing around the perimeter of the wok to get a good sizzle and to cook off some of the alcohol in the wine. Mix everything to ensure the seasonings are uniformly incorporated.
If the rice looks a little dry, feel free to sprinkle in some water or chicken stock, or if you want to be a bit more authentic, just a touch more oil (be careful with this—too much water content makes it soggy; too much oil makes it greasy).

Combine the shallot, garlic, 1 1/2 tablespoons of the soy sauce, wine, five spice powder, and sesame oil into a stainless steel or glass bowl. Add the chicken to the mixture and coat it in the marinade. Cover with plastic wrap and transfer to the refrigerator to marinate for 1 to 2 hours.

Combine ½ teaspoon of salt with ¼ tsp of five spice powder, and sprinkle a dash of the mixture over the skin of each chicken portion. Bake for about 35 minutes, and add additional broth if the bottom of the pan looks dry. Watch it closely, as you don’t want to overcook the chicken.

Next, combine the hot water, sugar, soy sauces and white pepper in a small bowl. This is the sauce that you’ll be adding to the rice, and it’s much easier to have it combined and ready to go before you start cooking. If you have questions about light and dark soy sauce, be sure to check out our Chinese sauces, vinegar, and oils ingredient page.
Take your cooked rice and fluff it with a fork or with your hands (you can rinse your hands in cold water if the rice starts sticking to them). If you are using cold leftover rice, try to break up the clumps as best as possible.
Heat the wok over medium high heat and add 1 tablespoon of oil. Add the eggs and scramble them until just done. You can even start scooping them up when they look like they are almost done and set aside. They will continue to cook in the bowl and you will cook them again in the rice. I'm only harping on this because you don’t want dried egg bits in your chicken fried rice!
Heat the wok until just smoking and spread another tablespoon oil around your wok. Sear the marinated chicken in one layer for 20 seconds. Stir-fry the chicken until about 80% done. Remove the chicken to your marinade bowl and set aside.
With the wok over medium high heat, add another tablespoon of oil and sauté the onions until translucent. Add the rice, and use your metal spatula to flatten out and break up any large clumps. If the rice is cold from the refrigerator, continue stir-frying until the rice is warmed up, which will take about 5 minutes. Sprinkling just a little water on large clumps of rice will help break them up more easily. If the rice was made fresh, cooking time will be faster. Just make sure that the rice isn't too wet––which will make frying it difficult.
Once the rice is warmed (very important or the sauce will not mix as well and the color of the rice will not be as uniform), add the sauce mixture and mix with a scooping motion until the rice is evenly coated with sauce. You will have to break up any remaining clumps of rice with the spatula as best as possible, but no need to be obsessive. The rice should be hot by this time. Now add the chicken and any juices from the bowl you set aside earlier and stir fry for another minute.
Add the eggs, bean sprouts, and scallions, and continue stir-frying the rice for another 30 seconds. Then gather all of the rice into the middle of the wok to let the sides of the wok heat up.

While that’s cooking, dice the thousand year-old egg and set it aside. Very thinly julienne the ginger. Don’t prepare this ahead of time, as we want the flavor of freshly cut ginger.
After 15 minutes, it’s time to add the julienned ginger, pork, and thousand year-old egg. Stir and simmer for another 5 minutes or so. Finally, stir in the white pepper and salt to taste. Serve piping hot with chopped scallions and cilantro.

I cook the rice per my rice cooker’s sweet rice setting. You can also cook the rice in a pot using our “How to cook rice without a rice cooker” recipe. Regardless of the method you use, the end result should be rice that is fully cooked, but still a bit firm and chewy--similar to making pasta al dente.
While the rice is cooking, prepare the rest of the ingredients and toast the Chinese fried dough so it’s crispy. Once the rice is cooked, take out your sushi rolling mat, line it with a sheet of clear plastic wrap, scoop out ½ of the rice and carefully flatten it out over the plastic into a thin layer. Wetting your hands with warm water can prevent the rice from sticking to them.
Next, lay 1 piece of Chinese fried dough in the center, along with ½ of the pork sung, and ½ of the Chinese preserved vegetables. If you’d like, you can also sprinkle over chopped cilantro, scallions, and sesame seeds at this step. Roll up the filling in the “sheet” of rice by rolling the sushi mat. Squeeze the sushi mat to ensure that the roll stays in tact. Repeat these steps to assemble the second roll.

In a small bowl, add ¾ teaspoon salt, ¼ teaspoon sugar, 2 teaspoons hot water, 1/4 teaspoon sesame oil, 1 teaspoon regular soy sauce, ½ teaspoon dark soy sauce and ⅛ teaspoon ground white pepper. Set aside.
Heat your wok over medium high heat and spread 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil around the perimeter of the wok.

Heat the wok over medium heat, and spread 1 tablespoon oil around your wok. Add the Chinese sausages (lop cheung), and stir-fry for 20 seconds.
Add the chopped onion, and stir fry for another 1-2 minutes until translucent. Turn the heat up to high, and add the rice. Use your metal wok spatula to flatten out and break up any clumps. If using leftover white rice, you will have to cook and stir fry the rice longer to heat it through.

With the wok over medium heat, add a tablespoon of oil and sauté the onions until translucent and then stir in the roast pork. Add the rice and mix well.

How to Cook Brown Rice,Kaitlin,https://thewoksoflife.com/how-cook-brown-rice/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/how-to-cook-brown-rice-8.jpg,"['2 cups uncooked brown rice ((about 375g))', 'water']","How to Cook Brown Rice on the Stove
Rinse 2 cups of brown rice. Add enough water to fill the pot an inch above the level of the rice, and let it soak for at least 20 minutes––ideally 90 minutes or even overnight.
When you are ready to cook the rice, pour off all the soaking water from the pot, leaving only the rice. Add fresh water in the same volume as rice. Since we started with two cups of uncooked rice, we added 2 cups of fresh water.
Cover the pot and put on the stove on high heat. Once the liquid comes to a boil, turn the heat to the lowest setting and continue to cook, covered, until all the water has evaporated and the rice is cooked through (about 15 to 20 minutes). Turn off the heat, and let your rice sit covered on the stove for another 10 minutes to finish cooking.
How to Cook Brown Rice in a Rice Cooker
Measure out your rice using the cup that came with the rice cooker! These cups are roughly ¾ of a cup, so using 2 cups results 1½ U.S. standard cups and will yield about 3¾ U.S. cups of brown rice. Give your brown rice a good rinse in the rice cooker pot before cooking and drain.
If your rice cooker has a brown rice setting, add enough water up to the water level lines for brown rice. If you added 2 of the rice cooker cups (1½ standard cups), fill the pot with fresh water up to the 2 cup water line.
If your rice cooker does not have a brown rice setting, add water so the water line is slightly above the 2 cup line. It’s also a good idea to let your rice sit in the rice cooker for an additional 10 minutes after it is “done” without opening the rice cooker lid to let it continue cooking inside the pot.
Let the rice sit in the water for at least 20 minutes, but ideally 90 minutes, before pressing the brown rice button (or regular ""cook"" button).",en-US,"{'calories': '344 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '72 g', 'proteinContent': '7 g', 'fatContent': '3 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '1 g', 'sodiumContent': '4 mg', 'fiberContent': '3 g', 'servingSize': '1 serving'}",5.0,,The Woks of Life,45,4 serving(s)
