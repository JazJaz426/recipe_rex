In a medium bowl, combine the sliced flank steak with the baking soda, water and oyster sauce. Massage these ingredients into the beef until any liquid has been absorbed by the meat. Marinate for 30 minutes.
Lightly dredge all of the beef slices in cornstarch. Set aside until ready to fry.
Slice all the fresh peppers crosswise into thin slices on the diagonal. Set aside the dried red peppers. Do not break them open or chop unless you want a very spicy Hunan Beef!
Stir the sugar into 2 tablespoons of hot water until dissolved. Add the Chinese black vinegar, soy sauce, and ground white pepper. Mix until well combined and set aside.
Heat your wok over high heat until smoking. Spread ⅓ cup oil around the wok, and sear the beef in three batches on both sides until browned and slightly crispy on the outside. Be sure the wok and oil are hot each time you add a batch of beef.
Drain the crispy beef by moving it up to the side of the wok. The oil will drain to the bottom and you can then transfer the beef to a sheet pan or plate. No need for paper towels or wire racks!
After frying the beef, leave about 2 tablespoons of the oil in the wok, and remove any excess. If your wok got burned in the frying process, this is a good time to wash it. While you want the beef flavor from frying, you definitely don’t want burned bits in the stir-fry if you got carried away with the heat during frying.
Assembling the stir-fry:
Set the wok over medium heat. Add the sliced ginger and fry until caramelized, about 30 seconds.
Next, add the shallots. Continue to fry for another 30 seconds, and add the fresh peppers (except for the red holland or fresno peppers). Turn the heat up to high and stir-fry for 1 minute to get a nice sear on the peppers.
Clear a section on the bottom of the wok, and add the dried chili peppers. Let them toast in the oil for 20 seconds. (If you want your dish spicier, add the dried chili peppers earlier, along with the shallots.)
Next, pour the Shaoxing wine around the perimeter of the wok. Add the sliced garlic, fermented black beans, and the red Holland or Fresno peppers. Stir-fry for another 30 to 60 seconds on high heat.
Next, add the fried beef and pour over the pre-prepared sauce. Maintain the highest heat possible and stir-fry everything together for 20 seconds. Add the scallions. Continue to stir fry until most––if not all––of the sauce has evaporated.",en-US,"{'calories': '360 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '20 g', 'proteinContent': '28 g', 'fatContent': '18 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '11 g', 'cholesterolContent': '68 mg', 'sodiumContent': '812 mg', 'fiberContent': '3 g', 'sugarContent': '4 g', 'servingSize': '1 serving'}",5.0,,The Woks of Life,60,4 serving(s)

Lightly scrub the tangerines with a vegetable brush under running water to remove wax and/or pesticides and towel dry. Peel the tangerines (reserving the peels) and squeeze 1/3 cup juice from the fruit.
Scrape as much of the white pith from the peels as you can, until you see just the skin, and julienne the peels into thin slivers. Set aside along with the juice. Then make a simple syrup by dissolving 1 tablespoon of sugar into 1 tablespoon of hot water.
Heat a saucepan or wok over low heat and add 1 teaspoon of oil and the tangerine peel slivers. Lightly toast the peels by tossing in the oil for about 30 seconds, and add the simple syrup. Continuing stirring the peels until the simple syrup evaporates and clings to the peels. Transfer the candied peels to a bowl along with any infused oil, and set aside.
Dredge the pieces of meat individually in the remaining ¼ cup of cornstarch until lightly coated, and heat 1/3 cup oil in a clean wok over high heat. Just before the oil starts to smoke, spread the flank steak pieces evenly in the wok, and let sear for 1 minute. Flip the steak over and let the other side sear for another 30 seconds. Transfer to a sheet pan, and tilt it slightly to let the oil drain to one side (lean it on a cookbook or cutting board). The beef should be seared with a nice crusty coating.
Drain the oil from the wok, leaving about 1 tablespoon behind, and turn the heat to medium-high. Add the ginger, star anise or five spice powder, dried tangerine peels and dried chili peppers, if using. (We have a whole star anise pictured in our photos, but the recipe calls for only one pod. After tasting the finished product, we felt that a whole star anise may have been too overwhelming for the dish.)
After about 15 seconds, add the garlic. Stir for another 10 seconds, and add the soy sauce, tangerine juice and brown sugar. Bring the sauce to a simmer, stirring occasionally.
Let the sauce simmer for about 2 minutes and slowly stir in the cornstarch slurry mixture–until the sauce coats the back of a spoon. Add the beef, candied tangerine slivers with the infused oil, and the scallions. Toss everything for another 30 seconds until all of the beef is well-coated.
There should be almost no liquid, as the sauce should be clinging to the beef. If you still have too much sauce, increase the heat slightly and stir-fry until thickened.

Blend until you have a smooth purée. Pour the marinade over the beef, topping the whole mixture with half of your chopped scallions and all of the sliced carrot. Stir thoroughly and let marinade for at least an hour, preferably overnight.
When the beef is done marinating, heat a cast iron skillet over high heat. The beef will cook in about 3 batches; Use 2 tablespoons of oil per batch.
When the cast iron skillet is searing hot, lay pieces of beef in one layer to cover the pan. Let fry until crisped and caramelized, then flip and let fry again.

We like eggs cooked both sunny side up or over easy, but you can make them however you like! The key to making a good fried egg is to heat the frying pan to high heat before adding a couple teaspoons of oil and the egg. While the egg is frying, make the sweet soy sauce mixture by combining 1 tablespoon soy sauce, 3 tablespoons hot water, and a teaspoon of sugar until the sugar is dissolved.

Cut the tomatoes into relatively large chunks. If using cherry or grape tomatoes, you can halve them or leave them whole.
Toss the tomatoes with 1 tablespoon salt, 4 tablespoons olive oil, 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar, and 3 cloves of minced garlic. Then arrange them in a single layer across two large rimmed baking sheets.
Roast for 1 hour in the middle of the oven, stirring once or twice. The tomatoes should look wrinkled, with slight caramelization on the edges.
About 15 minutes before your tomatoes are done roasting, place a large dutch oven or deep pot over medium high heat. Add 4 tablespoons of olive oil, along with the ground beef and pork. Stir, breaking up the chunks of ground meat into small crumbles. There is no need to brown or crisp them meat—cook just until it turns opaque.
Add the chopped onion and last 3 cloves of minced garlic. Season with salt and pepper, and cook for another 5 minutes.
By now the tomatoes should be done roasting. Add them to the pot, along with all their juices. Also add the tomato paste, beef stock, red wine, dried oregano, and black pepper, and sugar. Stir and bring to a low boil. Cover, turn down the heat, and simmer for 3 hours. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking. Taste the sauce and adjust seasoning (salt, pepper, sugar) if needed. (At this point, you could serve the sauce with pasta, but we think it tastes best the next day. If you have time for this, allow it to cool, and refrigerate overnight.
When you’re ready to serve, heat the sauce back up on the stove. Boil pasta (we like using spaghetti, but any cut of pasta will work) according to package directions, cooking it for 1 minute less than prescribed. (It will finish cooking in the sauce.) When the pasta is just under al dente (again, 1 minute less than the minimum cooking time on the package instructions), drain it, reserving about ½-⅔ cup of pasta water.
Immediately add the pasta back to the pot, and ladle in the hot meat sauce, along with about ⅓ cup of hot pasta cooking water. Toss the pasta for 1 minute, giving it time to absorb the liquid from the sauce and cooking water.

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Combine the berries, lemon juice, sugar, and flour in a bowl to make the filling. Roll out the dough into a 13-inch round and lay it on the parchment-lined baking sheet.
Pour the berries in the center of the circle and spread out, leaving a 2-inch border around the edge. Fold the edge up over the filling. Dot the last tablespoon of butter over the berries and brush the dough lightly with egg wash. Bake for 25 minutes, or until bubbly and golden brown.
In the last ten minutes of baking, make the vanilla sauce. Beat the egg yolks and sugar together until the yolks are thick and pale yellow, about 2-3 minutes.

Set aside. (We added a bit of water to marinate the beef, which generally is a no-no for beef...but for this fried rice dish, it keeps the small morsels of beef juicy and tender!)
Next, combine the hot water, sugar, sesame oil, soy sauces, MSG (if using), and white pepper in a small bowl. This is the sauce that you’ll be adding to the rice, and it’s much easier to have it combined and ready to go before you start cooking.
Take your cooked rice and fluff it with a fork or with your hands (you can rinse your hands in cold water if the rice starts sticking to them). If you are using cold leftover rice, try to break up the clumps as best as possible.
Heat your wok over medium high heat, add 1 tablespoon of oil and the eggs, and scramble them until just cooked. You can start scooping them up when they look like they are almost done. Transfer them back into the same bowl you mixed them in and set aside. They will continue to cook in the bowl and you will cook them again in the rice.
Heat the wok until just smoking and spread 1 tablespoon oil around your wok. Add the marinated beef in one layer, and let sear for 20 seconds. Next, stir fry the beef until about 70% done. Transfer the beef back to the marinade bowl, and set aside.
With the wok over medium high heat, add the last tablespoon of oil, and sauté the onions until translucent, about 2 minutes. Add the rice, using a metal spatula to flatten out and break up any large clumps. If the rice is cold from the refrigerator, continue stir-frying until the rice is warmed up, about 5 minutes. Also, sprinkling a little water on large clumps of rice will help break them up more easily.
Once the rice is warmed through, add the sauce mixture. Stir the rice with a scooping motion until the grains are evenly coated with sauce. The rice should be completely hot by now. Next, add the beef and any juices from the bowl you set aside earlier, and stir fry for another minute.
Add the eggs, breaking up any large clumps, peas, and the scallions. Continue stir-frying for another 30 seconds. Push the rice into the middle of the wok to let the perimeter of the wok heat up. After about 20 seconds, pour 1 tablespoon of Shaoxing wine around the perimeter of the wok. Stir-fry for another 20 seconds. Adding the wine using this method gives the dish a little extra wok hei! At this point, taste the rice to see if it needs a little more salt, soy sauce, or white pepper and season accordingly.

That’s the cinnamon, black cardamom, fennel seeds, star anise, cloves, tangerine peel, bay leaves, white peppercorns, licorice slices, sand ginger, and amomum white cardamon. Phew. It’ll be worth it. Trust me.
Next, rinse off the beef under cold running water. In a soup pot, add 16 cups of water, the ginger, and beef. Bring to a boil and cook for a few more minutes until you see some foam floating on the top of the water. Skim the foam off. You don’t want these impurities from the beef making your soup cloudy. Turn off the heat, fish out the pieces of beef, and strain the resulting broth through a fine-meshed strainer, into a heatproof bowl or other pot. Set aside, along with the ginger pieces.
In another large, thick-bottomed soup pot, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the rock sugar, the white parts of the scallion, and the garlic. Cook for a few minutes until the scallions are lightly seared. Add the beef, turn up the heat, and mix everything well.
Cook for about 5 minutes, and stir once or twice in between. Now add the Shaoxing wine, dark soy sauce, and light soy sauce, and stir everything together well so that the beef is coated in the soy sauce.
Now add the aromatics, plus the daikon, and the broth and ginger pieces that you boiled the beef in. Bring everything to a boil and immediately turn the heat down to medium. Simmer for 90 minutes. The broth should be steadily simmering where you can see water moving in the pot, but not at a rolling boil.
After 90 minutes, turn off the heat and let it stand (with the lid on) for another hour. Now your soup base is ready. Reheat, remove the aromatics, and add salt to taste before serving. Just remember, adding salt too early will dry out the beef.
Cook the noodles according to the package instructions, strain, and transfer to a large serving bowl. Blanch a handful of your leafy greens of choice in the noodle water, and add it to the noodles. Then, ladle in the beef and the soup. Top with the chopped green parts of the scallions you set aside earlier and some chopped cilantro (optional).

Before you cook the beef, prepare your grains and veggies. The beef cooks quickly, so you’ll want everything ready to go. If you’d prefer to have raw veggies, this step is easy. If you’re cooking the veggies, I cooked mine in the pan drippings from the steak––no additional seasoning required!
Season the steak with a small pinch of salt and plenty of black pepper. The miso dressing is quite salty, and we’ll be using soy sauce, so use your judgment per your tastes.
Next, heat a skillet over medium-high to high heat. Add 2 tablespoons butter to the skillet
Next, turn on your ventilation fan; you'll need it! Brown the butter slightly (this will happen without a problem if your pan is as hot as it should be) and add 1 teaspoon dark soy sauce.
Place some of the meat in the pan in a single layer. It should sizzle loudly when it hits the pan. If it doesn't, the pan isn't hot enough. Don't stir or disrupt the meat for 30 to 45 seconds.

Add the ginger, and caramelize for 20 seconds. There should be oil in the wok from searing the beef, but add another tablespoon of oil if needed. Next, add the minced garlic and the white portion of the scallions. Stir fry for 10 seconds, and add the Shaoxing wine.

While everything is coming up to a boil, mix your cornstarch slurry. Check the seasoning of the sauce, and add more salt or soy sauce if desired, but remember it will get saltier after it thickens!

The Perfect Prime Rib Roast Family Recipe,Bill,https://thewoksoflife.com/perfect-prime-rib-roast/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/prime-rib-7-1.jpg,"['A bone-in prime rib roast', '3 medium onions ((thickly sliced))', '1 teaspoon Kosher or coarse sea salt per pound of roast', '½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper per pound', '1 teaspoon minced garlic per pound', '1 teaspoon fresh rosemary per pound', '1 teaspoon fresh thyme per pound', '½ teaspoon olive oil per pound']","The butcher knows how much fat to leave on the roast, so no additional trimming is needed. Your prime rib roast should have a nice layer of fat on top, so it will baste itself. Before marinating, give your prime rib roast a quick rinse with cold water, and pat it dry with paper towels.
Place a flat roasting rack inside a roasting pan large enough to fit your roast, and spread the onions on top of the rack. It’s ok if you don’t have a roasting rack--resting the roast directly on the onions works also. Place the roast in the pan.
Mix the salt, pepper, garlic, herbs and olive oil in a bowl until well-combined. Use your hands to rub the roast all over with the marinade mixture, coating the surface evenly.
Use plastic wrap to cover the roast, and let it marinate overnight (at least 8 hours) in the refrigerator. We don’t expect the flavors to penetrate the roast completely, but it will work its way into the fatty collar portion of the roast. Skipping this step makes a big difference in flavor––we’ve had some mediocre roasts due to a lack of marinating time, so take my word for it!
Take the roast out of the refrigerator at least 2 hours before cooking time to allow the roast to come up to room temperature. It's best to take it out in the morning and leave it out 6 to 8 hours especially if you have a bone-in roast. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F, and place your roast on a lower oven rack. For bone -in roasts, you may want to put the roast at the bottom of the oven for the first hour. Placing the oven rack too high up will cause your roast to brown too quickly and burn!
After 30 minutes in the oven, add a ½ cup of water to the bottom of the roasting pan. The key is to allow the onions to brown and caramelize while roasting, but not to burn and smoke in the fat.
Cook the roast for another 30 minutes, until it begins to brown. If your oven heats unevenly, turn your roast 180 degrees. If there is more fat on one side that has not browned yet, make sure you position that side of the prime rib roast toward the inside of the oven. Use your own judgement on this one!
Once the prime rib roast is browned on the outside (1 hour total should do it, but times may vary depending on your oven), lower the heat to 350 degrees F. Continue roasting the prime rib for another 90 to 120 minutes. Baste the roast every 30 minutes if desired, and add hot water ½ cup at a time if the roasting pan does dry up.
If the top of the roast starts to char, put a small piece of foil to lightly cover the top, leaving the sides exposed. Again, turn the roast 180 degrees if needed for even roasting.
A general rule I use to approximate roasting time is a total of 15 minutes per pound, so for this 12 pound roast, the total roasting time should be 180 minutes. With temperature changes, that means roasting at at 450 degrees F for 60 minutes followed by 120 minutes at 350 degrees F. That said, these times are approximate--using a meat thermometer is a must. You don’t want to overcook it! We always cook for medium rare, so the time will be closer to 90 minutes, or when the prime rib roast reaches an internal temperature of 125 degrees F. This gives you two more well-done Prime Rib end cuts and a couple of medium pieces mixed in with the medium rare cuts. If you like it rare, then roast for less time, taking the roast out of the oven when the internal temperature reaches 120 degrees F. If your like it super-rare, then 115 degrees F may be for you. Just remember that the meat thermometer is your guide and that the roast will continue to cook a bit while it rests on the kitchen counter!
When ready, set your prime rib on a cutting board or serving platter, and lightly cover it with a piece of aluminum foil to rest for 15 to 20 minutes.
While the prime rib is resting, pour the pan juices through a fine mesh strainer into a fat separator. If there is not enough liquid, add a ½ cup of water to the hot pan, and stir lightly. Pour the juices from the fat separator into a small pot or saute pan and set aside. Warm up the au jus, and serve alongside the prime rib. You can further dilute it with some hot water to taste if it’s too salty. If it suits your fancy, you can also serve some horseradish alongside.",en-US,"{'calories': '709 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '7 g', 'proteinContent': '32 g', 'fatContent': '62 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '26 g', 'cholesterolContent': '137 mg', 'sodiumContent': '2430 mg', 'fiberContent': '1 g', 'sugarContent': '2 g', 'servingSize': '1 serving'}",4.95,,The Woks of Life,900,1 serving(s)

Combine warmed beef stock or water with 2 tablespoons soy sauce, 1 teaspoon dark soy sauce, 2 tablespoons oyster sauce, ½ teaspoon sesame oil, ½ teaspoon salt, ¼ teaspoon sugar and 1/8 teaspoon ground white pepper. Use pure beef stock only. Many are made with celery, tomato, and carrot, which will make this stir-fry taste like beef stew! If you can’t find a purer stock, use water and/or a beef bullion cube. Just remember to adjust the seasoning accordingly, as they can be salty. You can add more water and cornstarch slurry to offset this effect.
Heat your carbon steel wok until it’s just smoking. Spread 2 tablespoons oil around the perimeter, and add the beef.
Use your wok spatula to spread the beef out, and sear for 30 seconds. Stir-fry the beef for another 30 seconds until it’s 80% done, and transfer the beef back to the bowl.
Without washing the wok, turn the heat back on to medium. Add 1 tablespoon of oil to the wok, and immediately add the ginger, white portion of the scallions and garlic. Stir-fry for 15 seconds, and add the mushrooms.
Next spread 1½ tablespoons of Shaoxing wine around the perimeter of the wok to deglaze, and stir-fry everything for 20 seconds.
Add the stock and sauces to the wok, and bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally to deglaze the wok and heat the sauce. Once the mixture starts to simmer, add the beef and any juices from the bowl along with the rest of the scallions. Stir-fry everything to combine.
Immediately stir up your cornstarch slurry (the water and cornstarch has likely separated by now). Slowly drizzle about two thirds of the slurry into the sauce while stirring.
Within 10 seconds, you should see the sauce thicken. Add more cornstarch slurry if you like your sauce thicker, or add more stock or water if the sauce is too thick. (Remember your sauce will thicken slightly as it cools.) Either way, move quickly during this step so you don’t overcook your beef. Turn the heat off as soon as the sauce is to your desired consistency.
At this point, if you like a little extra richness and the combination of soy sauce and butter, stir in a tablespoon of butter just before plating the dish!

Rinse the steak under cold water and pat dry with paper towels. Sprinkle on all sides with salt and pepper, to taste. Heat your grill to the max heat--that means at least three of the burners on full blast high, and keeping the lid closed for a good 5-10 minutes.
Mix the melted butter together with the soy sauce in a small bowl. When the grill is heated, put the steak on the grill, letting it brown for about 1-2 minutes. You can close the grill lid to let the heat build up and get some nice caramelization on the edges of the steak. After 1-2 minutes, turn the steak 45 degrees to get those pretty grill marks. Let cook again for 1-2 minutes. Flip the steak and repeat the above steps for the other side.
When the steak is pretty well-browned on both sides, use your tongs lift up the steak and brown the edges. Thick cut steaks need TLC on the edges too! Now for the soy-butter glaze. Liberally brush the steak with the soy-butter mixture using a heat-proof basting brush. Flip the steak and brush the other side. You may want to wear an oven mitt for this process, as the butter may cause some fairly strong flame-ups. The glaze will make the steak perfectly caramelized and charred on the outside! Those grill marks we worked on earlier add the perfect uniformity of char and color!
Liberally glaze the steak continuously until it's cooked to your preferred doneness--rare, medium-rare, medium, etc; this translates to grilling the steak for an additional 3-5 minutes for medium-rare, 5-7 minutes for medium, or 8-10 minutes for medium-well, though this does depend on steak thickness. A better test for doneness is to poke the steak gently with the tongs. The squishier it is, the rarer your steak will be. More firm means more well-done. Simple right?
Remove the steak from the heat and let rest for 10-15 minutes. It's a long time, we know, but it'll all be worth it when you cut into your steak and skip the lake of beef juice that escapes onto your cutting board!
Serve with additional soy-butter glaze on the side (you can make a fresh batch or reheat what you used to baste the steak--remember that you basted the steak once it was cooked on the outside, so it's safe to consume post-grilling).",en-US,{},5.0,,The Woks of Life,20,2 serving(s)

Next, make the filling. Heat the oil in a frying pan over medium high heat. Brown the ground beef. Add the onion and garlic and cook until translucent. Next, add the Spanish olives, the chili peppers, the sun-dried tomato, the spices, sugar, and salt. Stir to combine, and let cook for an additional few minutes.
Add the water and bring to a boil. Add the tomato paste, stirring the entire mixture thoroughly to dissolve it, and let cook until the water has cooked off and the filling has thickened. Remove from the heat and cool completely.
Next, prep your dough! On a clean, floured work surface, roll the dough into a 1/8-inch layer. Using a round cookie cutter (or cup/bowl) in the size of your choice (you could make teeny tiny finger food empanadas instead of the bigger ones we made!), cut out as many rounds as you can. Peel away the spare dough and transfer back into the refrigerator.
For each empanada, spoon filling into the middle of the dough and top with a generous amount of cheese, ensuring you have enough margin around the edge of the dough to fold it over and seal the empanada. You can also stretch the dough out a bit into an oval shape and put the filling on one half of the dough, to make the folding process easier. Fold in half and crimp the edges, either with a fork, or if you want to be fancy, with a traditional twisting technique. (YouTube is your friend!) Repeat these steps with all of the dough rounds, and repeat the rolling out & cutting process until there is no leftover dough.
If you are baking the empanadas, heat your oven to 400 degrees. Brush the empanadas with oil prior to baking, and bake for 10-15 minutes. If you are frying the empanadas, heat a small, deep pot with enough oil to submerge a couple empanadas. Heat the oil to 350 degrees, and fry the empanadas until golden brown, in small batches of 2-3 (depending on the size of your pot and your empanadas). When they’re cooked through, transfer to a wire rack or a plate lined with a paper towel to drain.
Eat these empanadas on their own or with a nice salad!",en-US,"{'calories': '425 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '27 g', 'proteinContent': '18 g', 'fatContent': '27 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '11 g', 'cholesterolContent': '65 mg', 'sodiumContent': '333 mg', 'fiberContent': '1 g', 'sugarContent': '2 g', 'servingSize': '1 serving'}",4.75,,The Woks of Life,105,12 serving(s)

Set aside.
For the rest of the dish, combine the oyster sauce, sugar, Thai soy sauce, Thai black soy sauce, fish sauce, and white pepper in a small bowl. Stir to mix well.
Make sure your fresh rice noodles are at room temperature. If the noodles are really cold and stiff from refrigeration, rinse them quickly under hot tap water when you are ready to stir-fry the dish. This extra step will help you avoid a big homogenous lump of noodles during stir-frying. Be sure to shake off any excess water after rinsing and use them immediately.
The fresh wide rice noodles really set this dish apart from other noodle dishes, so try your best to find them. Or you can use our recipe for homemade rice noodles to make them at home. If either of these options don’t work, then use dried rice noodles. If using a dried rice noodle, follow the directions on the package and make sure you undercook the noodles slightly (al dente), since you will be cooking them again in the wok. After you drain the noodles thoroughly, toss the noodles with a tablespoon of oil. This will prevent them from sticking to the wok.
Heat your wok over high heat until it just starts to smoke, and spread 1 tablespoon of oil around the perimeter of the wok evenly to coat. Sear the beef until it is 80% cooked through, and transfer back to the marinade bowl.
Add another tablespoon of oil to the wok and stir in the garlic. Immediately add the Chinese broccoli and stir-fry for 20 seconds (stir constantly to prevent the garlic from burning).
Next, spread the noodles around the wok. Continue to work quickly--your wok should be at the highest heat setting. Spread the sauce mixture over the top of the noodles, and gently mix everything with your wok spatula using a scooping motion for about 20 seconds. Add the beef back to wok.
Push the mixture to one side to let the empty side of the wok heat for 10 seconds. Add another tablespoon of oil to the wok, and add the beaten eggs. Wait 5 seconds for them to begin to cook. Scramble the eggs for another few seconds, breaking them up into smaller pieces.
If your wok is not sizzling at this point, it probably means that your burner is not hot enough. Be patient, and the heat should “catch up.” Stir-fry the mixture just enough so the noodles heat up evenly, but don’t break into small pieces. Make sure you use your wok spatula to scrape the bottom of the wok so the noodles don’t stick.
As the wok heats up, you will notice that the food will stick to it less readily! But if you need to, you can add a little oil to make it easier to stir-fry.
Continue cooking, stirring less frequently (so the noodles get slightly caramelized, creating that restaurant-style flavor) for another 1 to 2 minutes, or until the noodles are heated through.

Fire up your grill to preheat. Season your steak with salt and pepper. When your grill is extremely hot (if you have a thermometer on your grill, it should be in the range of 500-600F), lay the steaks on the grill. Skirt steaks are very thin, so this process will be quick. Do not close the grill, and don’t walk away!
When the first side has been on the grill for about 1 minute, rotate the steaks to get some solid grill marks. After another minute, flip the steak, letting cook for 1 minute, then rotating, then letting cook for another minute or two. Once you’ve established a solid criss-cross, you can start moving around a little bit more erratically. This will ensure that you get a delicious uniform grill crust--none of that fakey McFakerson neat criss cross lame-ness you see in Outback Steakhouse commercials. These instructions are for medium rare, which is in our opinion the best way to enjoy your steak. If you like it more or less well done, add or subtract cooking time.

Heat 1/4 cup of oil in a heavy-bottomed pot over medium low heat. Add the garlic, shallots, lemongrass, and bay leaves to infuse the oil. Cook for a few minutes. Then turn the heat down to the lowest setting and add the curry powder and turmeric. Stir until well-combined.

Bring everything to a boil again. Once boiling, remove the shank and the chicken, discard the water, and clean the pot. This process gets rid of any impurities, and will give your broth a cleaner flavor.
Put the beef shank and chicken back into the pot along with the roasted bones, 10 more cups of water, and 4 cups chicken stock.

Bring to a boil and boil for 5 minutes. Drain in a colander and thoroughly clean the stockpot. This process removes any impurities/scum and will give you a much cleaner broth.
Meanwhile, char your ginger and onions. Use tongs to hold the ginger and onions (one at a time) over an open flame, or place each directly on a gas burner. Turn until they’re lightly blackened and fragrant, about 5 minutes. Rinse away all the blackened skins.
Add 5 quarts fresh water back to the stockpot and bring to a boil. Transfer the bones and meat back to the pot, along with the charred/cleaned ginger and onions. Add the scallions, fish sauce and sugar. Reduce the heat to low, and simmer until the beef chuck is tender, about 40 minutes. Skim the surface often to remove any foam and fat.
Remove one piece of the chuck and transfer to a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking process. Then transfer this piece of beef to a container and refrigerate (you will slice this to serve with your pho later. If you were to leave it in the pot, it would be too dry to eat). Leave the other piece of chuck in the pot to flavor the broth.

This adds key flavor to the dish. Transfer the cubes to a medium bowl, and add 1 tablespoon vegetable oil, ⅛ teaspoon baking soda, 1 teaspoon cornstarch, and ¼ teaspoon salt. Toss until the steak is well-coated. Set aside for 30 minutes to 1 hour.
In a small bowl, combine the water, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, oyster sauce, white pepper, and sesame oil. Set aside.
Make sure your bok choy is thoroughly cleaned. We always triple wash our bok choy. Not doing a thorough job risks sand ruining your vegetables.
Heat wok over high heat. Spread 1 tablespoon vegetable oil around the perimeter of the wok, and immediately add your smashed ginger slices. After 5 to 10 seconds, add the chopped garlic and bok choy.
Quickly stir-fry the bok choy (so the garlic doesn’t burn), until it begins to wilt. You can also cover the bok choy for 30 seconds if your wok burner is not producing enough heat.
After the bok choy is cooked and wilted (about 60 seconds or so), add the salt, sugar and MSG (if using). Mix thoroughly, transfer to a warm serving plate, and set aside. MSG is totally optional, but it really brings out the flavor of stir-fried vegetables.
Work quickly through these next steps, because your stir-fried bok choy is waiting to be topped with your delicious steak! Carefully rinse your wok with warm water, drain, and wipe off any excess moisture. Place the wok back over the burner set to high heat. Spread ½ tablespoon vegetable oil around the perimeter of the wok.
Once the wok begins to smoke, add the steak in a single layer, fat-side down for any pieces with visible fat.
Sear for 30 seconds or until brown. Use your wok spatula to toss everything together to ensure even cooking and browning, but resist the temptation to stir too much. High heat is essential to ensure you have a good sear and maximum flavor. I like to sear the steak until cooked medium / medium rare, which is why this steak stir fry recipe calls for large 1-inch chunks of steak.
Once done to your liking, turn off the heat, and scoop the steak over the bok choy to rest. (If any liquid has pooled on the bok choy plate, pour the excess off before adding the beef.)
You’ll need at least 1-2 tablespoons of the residual oil in the wok. Pour off any excess and discard. This is pure beef flavor that will make your sauce taste that much better. Turn the wok back up to medium-high heat. Pour the prepared steak sauce into the wok, using it to deglaze the wok. If you want more sauce, you can add some additional water—bonus if you use the water from the bok choy plate, which has a nice ginger and garlic flavor.
When the sauce is simmering, stir up the cornstarch slurry and drizzle it into the sauce, letting it thicken until it coats a spoon. Simmer for an additional 20 seconds to ensure the cornstarch is cooked.

Be sure to cut the beef against the grain. If you’re knife skills are not that good, place the beef into the freezer until it is firm but not frozen; slicing the beef will be much easier!
Add 1 teaspoon each of cornstarch, oil, and soy sauce to the beef in a bowl. Use your hands to massage these ingredients into the beef and set aside to marinate for 20 minutes.
After the beef has marinated, heat a wok over high heat. Add a tablespoon of oil. When the oil starts to smoke, sear the beef for 30-60 seconds, just until browned. Remove from the wok and set aside. Add 2 more tablespoons of oil to the wok along with the ginger. Let the ginger caramelize for 15 seconds. Add the garlic and Chinese broccoli, and stir-fry for 1 minute, making sure the vegetables are cooking evenly. The Chinese broccoli will start turning a bright green.
Add the beef, oyster sauce, soy sauce, salt, sugar, sesame oil and hot chicken stock and stir-fry until mixed thoroughly. (Use hot chicken stock so you don’t kill the stir-fry party going on in the wok by reducing the temperature of the ingredients. Nothing worse than adding cold chicken stock and then having to wait minutes for the liquid to get back to a boiling, sizzling state.)
Once the liquid comes to a boil, push the beef and vegetables away from the middle of the wok and stir in the cornstarch slurry gradually to thicken the sauce. Use only what you need!

The baking soda will help to tenderize the beef. Then “wash” the beef under running water for 5 minutes, using a light to moderate stream of water so it flows out, but the beef stays in the bowl. After the beef has been rinsed, pour out the water, and marinate the beef with two teaspoons of cornstarch. Set aside.
Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in your wok over high heat. Stir fry the bean sprouts for about 2 minutes, then add the Enoki mushrooms. Stir and mix everything well until the mushrooms have wilted. Turn off the heat, pick a large serving bowl with some depth, and spread the bean sprouts and Enoki mushrooms around the bottom of the bowl.
Now wash the wok. It’s important to start the next step with a clean wok!
Heat a ¼ cup of oil in the wok over medium heat. Cook the ginger slices until they start to turn light brown. Add the scallions and the Sichuan peppercorns. Cook for two minutes, making sure to avoid burning the spices. Now add the spicy bean sauce/paste, stir, and let the sauce cook in the oil for about 3-4 minutes. This will give the oil a bright red color. It’s important to control the heat––too low and the oil won't turn that vibrant red color; too high and you’ll burn everything!
Once the oil takes on a bright red color, add the stock and sugar. Turn up the heat to high, stirring, and let the liquid come to a boil. Immediately add the beef, and stir slowly to separate the pieces, still using high heat. Quickly turn off the heat once all the beef pieces turn opaque. (You don’t have to cook the beef completely through––a hint of pink in the middle equals tender beef.) Now, pour everything over the vegetables in the bottom of your serving bowl.
Top it with the minced garlic, chili flakes, and chopped cilantro. In a small saucepan, heat the last 3 tablespoons of oil until shimmering. Pour the heated oil over the garlic and chili in a very thin stream––you should get a good sizzle.
