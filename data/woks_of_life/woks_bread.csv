Add ½ cup warm water, 1 teaspoon active dry yeast and 1/3 cup flour to a large bowl, and mix well. Set aside in a warm place for 15 minutes until the mixture foams up.
Mix the coconut oil into the foamy yeast mixture until you can’t see any solids and then mix in the remaining 1/2 cup of warm water. Add the last 2 2/3 cups flour, vital wheat gluten, sugar, and salt. Mix in until a dough forms. Knead for 10 minutes. You can add some flour to make it easier to work with, but don't worry if it's a bit sticky. Cover with plastic wrap and let it proof for 1 hour.
While that's happening, make the filling. Heat your wok or cast iron pan over medium-high heat and add the oil, onions and tofu. Cook for 3-5 minutes until one side of the tofu is just browned. Turn the mixture over with a rubber spatula and brown the other side. Feel free to add more oil if the mixture looks a bit dry.
Add the soy sauces, sugar, salt, sesame oil, hoisin sauce, and white pepper. Stir everything together and then add the water/vegetable stock and flour. Stir gently so as not to break up the tofu chunks.
Let the mixture simmer until the liquid thickens into a sauce. It should thicken further as it cools. Set the mixture aside to cool completely before making the buns. If the mixture looks a little wet, you can put it in the fridge to solidify it for easier assembly.
Once the dough has proofed for an hour, turn it out onto a well-floured surface and knead for another 2-3 minutes to ensure most of the air bubbles are gone. Add just enough flour so you can knead it, but be careful not to dry out the dough. Divide the dough into 10 equal pieces and cover with a damp towel.
Roll out each dough ball into a disc, where the middle of the disc is a bit thicker than the sides. Put about 2 tablespoons of filling in the center and fold up the edges to close the bun. The dough is fairly elastic, so you can stretch it to cover the filling if needed. Check out our other char siu bao recipe for more photos on bun folding, Chinese BBQ Pork Buns (Cha Siu Bao. Be sure to pinch it closed, and place it seam side down on a parchment-lined baking sheet.
Keep all the dough balls and the finished buns covered with damp towels until they're all assembled. Let the buns sit for another 10 minutes while you preheat your oven to 375 degrees.
Mix together the sugar and warm water and brush the mixture onto the buns. Place the buns in the oven and immediately turn the temperature down to 350 degrees. Bake for 20-25 minutes, until golden. Brush the buns with the remaining sugar water when they come out of the oven. Serve warm!
Tip: Store these buns in the refrigerator. When you're ready to eat one, heat it up in the microwave for 15-30 seconds.
By the way, this dough is seriously good enough to use for our regular roast pork buns.

Steamed Red Bean Buns,Judy,https://thewoksoflife.com/steamed-red-bean-buns/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/red-bean-buns-13.jpg,"['7 ounces red bean paste ((recipe here))', '1 teaspoon granulated sugar', '1/4 cup lukewarm water', '1 teaspoon active dry yeast', '1 2/3 cups all purpose flour ((plus more for dusting))', '3 tablespoons powdered sugar', '1/4 teaspoon salt', '1/3 cup lukewarm milk (Milk should be lukewarm or at room temperature)']","First, prepare the red bean paste. You can use our recipe for sweet red bean paste, or opt for store-bought. Our original recipe makes a large batch, but you can freeze leftovers to make other recipes. To make the exact amount needed for this recipe, scale the serving size down from 21 to 4 in the recipe card. The filling must be cooled completely and can be made up to several days in advance.
In a large mixing bowl, add 1 teaspoon sugar to ¼ cup warm water, and stir in the yeast until dissolved. Let sit for 15 minutes until the yeast foams up.
Next, stir in the milk and add the flour, powdered sugar, and salt. With the dough hook attachment, turn the mixer on low. Let the mixer go for 5 minutes, or knead by hand for 8 minutes, or until the dough is soft and smooth. The dough should not stick to your hands or the bowl.
Cover with a plate to proof for 1 hour in a warm spot, or until the dough doubles in size. I proof the dough inside my closed microwave with a large mug of just boiled water next to it.
While the dough is proofing, roll 8 balls of red bean filling between your palms. Each should weigh about 25g. Cover them with a damp towel to prevent them from drying out. Set aside.
Cut out eight 3""x 3"" squares of parchment paper for the buns to sit on in the steamer.
Once the dough is done proofing, put it back in the mixer and knead for another 2 to 3 minutes to get rid of any air bubbles (or knead by hand). Transfer to a clean, lightly floured surface. Use a kitchen scale to equally divide the dough into 8 pieces (mine were 50g apiece). Cover with a clean kitchen towel while you assemble the buns.
To assemble, roll a dough ball into a 4-inch disc, making the edges slightly thinner than the center. Put one ball of red bean filling in the center of the dough. Gather the edges of the dough around the filling, and pinch the edges together to close the opening.
Place the dough seam side down on a parchment square, and transfer to your steaming rack. The buns need at least 1-inch of space between each other. Repeat with the remaining dough until all the buns are assembled.
Prepare your steamer with about 5 cups of warm water. Put the buns in the steamer and cover. Your steamer water should be lukewarm to help with proofing, but do not turn on the heat at this time. Let them proof for 30 minutes.
Now turn the heat on to medium/high. Set your timer for 15 minutes, during which the heat will slowly bring the water to a boil and steam the buns. It may seem slow to heat in the beginning, but don’t be tempted to disturb the buns or remove the lid.
After the 15-minutes have elapsed, turn off the heat, and let the buns sit in the steamer with the lid tightly covered for another 5 minutes. DO NOT UNCOVER THE LID AT ANY POINT DURING THE STEAMING AND POST-STEAMING TIME. The buns need 5 minutes to set, or they will collapse and become wrinkly, so be patient. They can only be revealed after the final 5-minute timer goes off!

Let the dough rest for 10 minutes. In the meantime, dust a small handful of semolina flour on a large baking sheet. Roll the dough out on a lightly floured surface to about a ½ inch thickness. Use a biscuit cutter or a water glass to cut circles out of the dough. Gather up the loose pieces, and roll them out again. Cut more circles. Continue the process until all the dough is used up. You should get 12-14 muffins.
Place the circles on the baking sheet with semolina flour. Shift them around to coat the bottoms of the muffins with the semolina. Cover with a clean, damp kitchen towel and let the muffins rise for 1 hour in a warm place.
Place a skillet over medium low heat, and use a pastry brush to brush a very thin layer of oil on the bottom of the pan.

If you're in a humid climate and the dough is too sticky, feel free to add a little more flour ¼ cup at a time until it comes together. If you don't have a mixer and would like to knead by hand, extend the kneading time by 5-10 minutes.
After 15 minutes of mixing, the dough is ready for proofing. Cover the bowl with a damp towel and place in a warm spot for 1 hour. The dough will grow to 1.5X its original size.
Meanwhile, prepare your filling and topping. To make the filling, heat 2 tablespoons oil in a wok over medium high heat. Add the onion and stir-fry for 2 minutes. Add the sugar, soy sauce, oyster sauce, sesame oil, and dark soy. Stir and cook until it starts to bubble up. Add the water and flour. Reduce the heat to medium low and cook, stirring, for a couple minutes until thickened. Remove from the heat and stir in the roast pork. Set aside to cool.
To prepare the topping, add the dry milk powder to a mixing bowl. If your dry milk powder has some larger clumps, crush them up with your fingers so it’s uniformly powdery. Add the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and superfine sugar. Stir to combine. Add the shortening, milk, egg yolk, and vanilla. Use your hands to mix everything together into a dough. If it’s too dry, add a little more milk a teaspoon at a time until it comes together. Cover with an overturned bowl or plate, and set aside at room temperature.
After the hour of proofing, put the dough back in the mixer and stir for another 5 minutes to get rid of air bubbles. You can also knead by hand. Dump the dough onto a lightly floured surface, and cut it into 18 equal pieces.
To assemble, divide the topping mixture into 18 equal pieces and roll each into a ball. Roll each ball out into a flat circle using a rolling pin.
Take a piece of bread dough, and flatten with your hands into a rough circle. Put a heaping tablespoon of pork filling in the middle, and wrap the dough around it. Roll into a smooth ball between your hands, and place on a parchment-lined baking sheet, seam-side down. Top the bun with a circle of topping.
Continue assembling until all the buns are made. Cover with a clean, damp towel and allow to rise for another hour.
After they’re done rising, position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Brush the topping with egg yolk and any exposed dough with egg white. Bake for 18-20 minutes until golden. If you notice the topping getting too dark, tent the buns lightly with foil.

In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment or a large mixing bowl, add the ingredients in the following order: heavy cream, milk, ½ of a beaten egg, sugar, cake flour, bread flour, yeast, and salt.
Turn the mixer on to the lowest setting (or stir with a wooden spoon), and mix until a dough forms. Knead the dough on the lowest setting for 15 minutes, occasionally stopping the mixer to push the dough together. The dough should pull away from the sides of the bowl, but stick to the bottom of the mixing bowl. If kneading by hand, extend the kneading time by 5-10 minutes.
If you’re in a humid climate and the dough is sticking to the sides of the bowl, add a little more flour 1 tablespoon at a time until it pulls away from the sides. Avoid adding too much additional flour, or the bread will be dense and less fluffy.
Cover the bowl with a damp towel and place in a warm spot for 60-90 minutes, or until doubled in size.
While the dough is proofing, cook the bacon on both sides, until crisp but still pliable. Cool and chop into ½ inch pieces. Prepare the scallions by washing them, wiping them thoroughly dry, and finely chopping them. Thoroughly grease an 8-inch or 9-inch round cake pan with butter or oil.
After the dough has doubled in size, punch the air out of it and knead for 5 minutes. Form it into a round ball, and roll it out into a ¼ inch (0.66 cm) thick rectangle or rough circle. Sprinkle the scallions and bacon evenly over the dough, and cut it into small 1.5 inch (4 cm) squares.
Fold each square in half like a taco with the bacon scallion filling on the inside. Nestle them in the pan standing up on one end of the taco. At this point, you can cover and refrigerate the dough overnight, if making this recipe in advance. The next day, remove the dough from the refrigerator, let it come up to room temperature, and proceed with the next step.
Proof the dough for 1 hour. Towards the end of the proofing process, place a rack in the center of your oven and preheat it to 350°F/175°C.

The dough should not stick to the sides of the mixer, but it may look a little bit sticky (sticking to the bottom of the mixer is ok). If you’re in a humid climate, and the dough is sticking to the sides of the mixing bowl, add more flour 1 tablespoon at a time until it comes together. Alternatively, you can stir all the dough ingredients together with a wooden spoon in a large mixing bowl, and then knead by hand for 20 minutes.
Shape the dough into a ball, and cover the bowl with an overturned plate or damp towel. Place in a warm spot to proof for 75-90 minutes, or until the dough doubles in size. (A good proofing environment is a closed microwave, with a mug of hot boiled water next to the bowl.)
While that's happening, mix the filling. In a medium bowl, combine the coconut, milk powder, sugar, salt, melted butter, egg yolks, and milk. Set aside.
After the first proof, knead for another 5 minutes to punch the air out of it. Then dump the dough on a lightly floured surface, shape it into a ball, and cut it in half. Cut each half of dough into 6 pieces, so you get 12 equal pieces of dough.
To shape the buns, knead and roll piece of dough into an even ball, and flatten. Roll into a 5x10 inch rectangle. Spread a layer of filling onto the rectangle, pressing the filling into the dough and leaving about a half inch of margin all around.
Roll the dough lengthwise into a cigar. Cut the cigar in half lengthwise, leaving it attached at the top end, so it looks like a long pair of pants.

Cantonese Fried Dough (Ham Chim Peng),Judy,https://thewoksoflife.com/ham-chim-peng-fried-dough/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ham-chim-peng-4.jpg,"['3 3/4 cups all-purpose flour ((plus extra for dusting))', '3 tablespoons baking powder', '1 teaspoon baking soda', '1/3 cup dark brown sugar', '1/3 cup regular granulated sugar', '2 cubes fermented red bean curd ((mashed))', '1/4 teaspoon five-spice powder', '1 1/3 cups water', 'Neutral oil ((for frying))', '3 tablespoons sesame seeds']","First mix together the flour, baking powder, and baking soda in a mixing bowl. Next, add the dark brown sugar, regular sugar, mashed fermented bean curd, and five-spice powder. Slowly stir in the water to form a wet dough. Make sure everything is well-combined. Cover and let the dough rest for 15 minutes.
While the dough is resting, take a medium pot and fill it with about 1 inch of oil for frying. Set aside. Once the dough is rested, dust a clean surface with a good amount of flour, and scrape the dough onto the floured surface. The dough will be very wet, so flour both hands before handling the dough. Divide it into 12 equal pieces.
Take each dough ball, and dip it into sesame seeds to coat--more or less depending on your preference. You can also coat both sides if you like. Flatten the dough to a 5-inch circle with a small hole in the middle and set aside on a well-floured surface. They can look quite rough at this point; don't feel the need to make them look perfect! Repeat until all 12 dough balls have been shaped.
Now, heat the oil to 325 degrees. Keep the heat between 325 to 350 degrees for the duration of the frying process. Fry the dough in batches, frying each side until golden brown, flipping one to two times to brown both sides. It should take 1 to 2 minutes each.

Chinese BBQ Pork Buns (Baked Char Siu Bao),Sarah,https://thewoksoflife.com/chinese-bbq-pork-buns-cha-siu-bao/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/char-siu-bao-28.jpg,"['2/3 cup heavy cream ((at room temperature))', '1 cup milk ((whole milk preferred, but you can use 2%, at room temperature))', '1 large egg ((at room temperature))', '1/3 cup sugar', '1/2 cup cake flour ((can substitute 1/2 cup all purpose flour sifted with 1 tbsp cornstarch))', '3 1/2 cups bread flour ((tap measuring cup to avoid air pockets))', '1 tablespoon active dry yeast ((or instant yeast))', '1 1/2 teaspoons salt', '2 tablespoons vegetable oil', '1/2 cup shallots ((or onion, finely chopped))', '2 tablespoons granulated sugar', '2 teaspoons light soy sauce', '2 tablespoons oyster sauce', '1 1/2 teaspoons sesame oil', '2 teaspoons dark soy sauce', '¾ cup chicken stock', '2 tablespoons all purpose flour', '2 cups Chinese roast pork', 'egg wash ((1 egg, beaten with 1 tablespoon water) )', '1 tablespoon sesame seeds ((optional))', '1 tablespoon granulated sugar ((dissolved in 1 tablespoon boiling water))']","In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment, add the dough ingredients in the following order. Start with the room temperature heavy cream, milk, and egg. Then add the sugar, cake flour, bread flour, yeast, and salt, in that order.
Turn the mixer on to the lowest setting to bring the dough together. When a scraggly dough has formed, knead on low speed for 15 minutes. If needed, turn off the mixer to bring the dough together with a rubber spatula. Alternatively, you can stir all the dough ingredients together with a wooden spoon in a large mixing bowl, and then knead by hand for 20 minutes.
The dough should stick to the bottom of the bowl, but should not stick to the sides. If you’re in a humid climate, and the dough is sticking to the sides of the mixing bowl, add more flour 1 tablespoon at a time until it comes together.
Shape the dough into a ball, and cover with an overturned plate or damp towel. Place in a warm spot to proof for 75-90 minutes, or until the dough doubles in size. (A good proofing environment is a closed microwave, with a mug of hot boiled water next to the bowl.)
While that’s happening, make the meat filling. Be sure to dice the pork finely rather than in large chunks, so the buns are easier to fill. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a wok over medium heat. Add the shallot/onion and stir-fry for 2 minutes. Add the sugar, soy sauce, oyster sauce, sesame oil, and dark soy. Stir and cook until it begins to bubble. Add the chicken stock and flour. Reduce the heat to medium low and cook, stirring, for 2-3 minutes, until thickened. Stir in the roast pork.
Turn off the heat, and remove the filling from the wok onto a large plate. Separate the filling into 16 roughly equal piles, to ensure you get an even amount in each bun. Set aside to cool.
After the first proof, knead the dough for another 5 minutes to punch the air out. Dump it onto a lightly floured surface, and shape it into a ball.
Cut it into 16 equal pieces (in half, then quarters, then in quarters again). The best way to ensure you get evenly sized buns is to weigh the entire dough ball, divide the weight by 16, and then weigh out each individual piece to match that weight.
To shape the buns, knead each individual dough ball to punch out any air bubbles and smooth it out. Roll it into a 4-inch circle, with the center slightly thicker than the outer edges.
While assembling the buns, be sure to keep your hands clean. Any grease from the filling on your fingers will make it very difficult to seal them.
Add 1 portion of filling to the bun, and crimp it closed, making sure it’s tightly sealed. Lay them seam side down on baking sheets lined with parchment paper, about 3 inches apart.
Cover with a clean towel and allow to rise at room temperature for another hour.
Arrange two racks in the top and bottom thirds of the oven, and preheat to 400°F/200°C. Brush the buns with egg wash, and sprinkle them with sesame seeds, if using.
Transfer the buns to the oven, and immediately turn down the temperature to 350°F/175°C. Bake for 22-25 minutes, or until golden brown.
Remove from the oven and immediately brush the buns with the sugar syrup while they’re still hot.

Judy's Homemade Brioche Recipe,Judy,https://thewoksoflife.com/homemade-brioche-recipe/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/homemade-brioche-recipe-22.jpg,"['6 eggs ((at room temperature))', '1 cup unsalted butter ((2 sticks/½ pound/230g, at room temperature))', '4 ¾ cups all-purpose flour ((620g, divided))', '1 tablespoon active dry yeast ((9g))', '¼ cup granulated sugar ((50g))', '1½ teaspoons salt ((8g))', '½ cup warm water ((120 ml, about 120 degrees F/49 degrees C))', '2 teaspoons sugar ((10g, dissolved in 1 tablespoon/15 ml water))']","Day 1:
Take out 6 eggs and 1 cup / 230g butter a few hours before you begin to bring them to room temperature. Prepare all other ingredients before starting.
In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, mix together 1 cup flour (130g), 1 tablespoon active dry yeast (9g), ¼ cup granulated sugar (50g), and 1½ teaspoons salt (8g), before adding ½ cup (120 ml) warm water (at about 120 degrees F/49 degrees C). Turn the mixer on at medium speed for a couple of minutes until well-combined.
Now add in 1 egg at a time. Only add the next egg when the previous egg is well incorporated.
Set the mixer to low. Add in 2 cups of flour (260g), a ¼ cup at a time, and let the mixer go until the dough is well combined.
Turn the mixer off, and cut the 2 sticks of softened butter into small cubes/chunks. With the mixer on medium, add the butter in 6 separate batches, waiting until the butter is well incorporated after each batch before adding more.
Set mixer to low. Now add in 1 3/4 cups of flour (230 grams), a ¼ cup at a time until the dough is well-combined. This dough will be very sticky (closer to a very thick batter) when it’s done.
Use a rubber spatula to clean the dough off the mixing paddle, and scrape the sides of the mixing bowl. Cover the dough with a plate or plastic wrap and let it proof at room temperature (about 70 degrees F/21 degrees C) for 3 hours, until it doubles in size.
After 3 hours have elapsed, punch and deflate the dough completely with a rubber spatula. Cover the dough with a plate again, and refrigerate it overnight until 3 hours before you’re ready to bake the next day.
Day 2:
Remove the dough from the refrigerator. Divide it into two equal pieces. Shape them on a lightly floured clean surface, and place each into its own loaf pan (loaf pan size: 9"" x 5""). The chilled dough is a bit stiffer to work with, so you can use a rolling pin to help shape it into the desired width and length. If you do this, make sure to roll the dough lengthwise like a cigar when you’re done to ensure a rounded top to your loaf. Whatever you do, the dough should fit snugly in the loaf pan.
Now, you can create plain loaves as I’ve described above, or you could create a braid or individual buns, as pictured. Totally up to you, the baker!
Cover each loaf pan tightly with clear plastic wrap, and let proof at room temperature for about 2½ to 3 hours, until doubled in size.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F / 180 degrees C while the dough is proofing. Bake for 37 to 40 minutes in the center of the oven. Tent the loaves with foil if the crust is getting too dark. While it’s baking, prepare the sugar water by mixing 2 teaspoons sugar with 1 tablespoon water until the sugar is completely dissolved. When the bread is done, remove from the oven, and immediately brush the tops of the bread with sugar water to give it that shiny finish.
Let the bread sit in the loaf pan for 5 minutes to cool before transferring the loaves from the pans to a cooling rack. This cooling step is important so the bread does not fall apart.
Once the bread has cooled completely, you can store it in a tight sealed container or zip-lock bag to keep it fresh. This bread is also heavenly when served slightly warm with softened butter.",en-US,"{'calories': '220 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '26 g', 'proteinContent': '5 g', 'fatContent': '11 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '6 g', 'cholesterolContent': '74 mg', 'sodiumContent': '195 mg', 'fiberContent': '1 g', 'sugarContent': '3 g', 'servingSize': '1 serving'}",4.83,,The Woks of Life,2920,20 serving(s)

Wait 15 minutes until the yeast mixture “blooms” and foams. Stir in 1 tablespoon of canola oil, and set aside.
While you wait for the yeast mixture to “bloom,” whisk together 2 cups all-purpose flour, 2 tablespoons cornstarch, ¼ teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon baking soda in a medium bowl. Stir in the yeast mixture using a rubber spatula. After the dry and wet ingredients are well incorporated, knead the dough until smooth and soft. If the dough feels sticky, add a bit more flour 1 tablespoon at a time, and continue kneading until the dough is smooth, soft, and pliable, but not sticky. Brush the top of the dough with 1 teaspoon canola oil, cover the bowl with a plate, and let it proof at room temperature until it has doubled in size (about 1 hour).
While the dough is proofing, prepare your steaming device/setup of choice. (Check our Chinese cooking tools page for steamer setup options using a steamer rack in a wok or a multi-level metal steamer—both of which we use regularly in our kitchen. Leave at least 2 inches of space between the water and the steam rack so the water doesn’t touch the buns during the steaming process.
After the dough finishes proofing, punch it down and knead it for a few minutes to get rid of all the air bubbles. This step is important for achieving smooth and uniform buns! Portion the dough into 12 equal balls. Roll each ball into a 4x7 inch oval shape, lightly brushing the tops with oil to prevent sticking. Fold the dough in half with a small piece of parchment paper in the middle. Line the bun with another piece of parchment paper on the bottom and place it in your steamer to proof a second time. Repeat these steps until you’ve used up all the dough, cover the lid of the steamer, and let proof for another 20 minutes.
After 20 minutes, turn the heat on your steamer setup to high. Once you see steam coming out, reduce the heat to medium, and let the buns steam for another 10 minutes. Turn off the heat and let the buns rest inside the steamer for 5 minutes. Do NOT Remove the cover/lid. This is VERY important, because if you remove the cover too early, the buns will collapse and lose their fluffy shape!!!
After 5 minutes have elapsed, the buns are ready to remove from the steamer.
You can use them immediately, or these buns also freeze well for later use. Just let them cool completely before freezing, because any condensation inside whatever you use to store the buns will make them soggy. Then, when you’re ready to eat them, just steam them for 5 minutes to reheat.",en-US,"{'calories': '98 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '19 g', 'proteinContent': '3 g', 'fatContent': '1 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '1 g', 'sodiumContent': '62 mg', 'fiberContent': '1 g', 'sugarContent': '1 g', 'servingSize': '1 serving'}",5.0,,The Woks of Life,165,12 serving(s)

Let stand for 15 minutes until foamy.
While the yeast is working, whisk together the melted butter, light brown sugar, egg, milk, and salt. Make sure everything is dissolved and thoroughly combined. With the dough hook attachment, turn the mixer on low, and add the whole wheat flour to the milk mixture one cup at a time.
Now add the foamy yeast liquid to the dough, keeping the mixer on low speed until you get a well combined wet dough mixture (see the photo). This process will take a few minutes. Now it’s time to add the all-purpose flour, ½ cup at a time, with the mixer still at low speed. Added on 4/12/2018: Change to adding 1 tablespoon at a time with the last 1/2 cup of all-purpose flour until the dough ""lifts"" away from the sides of the mixing bowl, because you might not need all 3 cups of all-purpose flour in the drier months.
If the dough is still wet, add one tablespoon of flour at a time, until the dough “lifts” from the sides of the mixing bowl. Try not to add too much flour, though. The dough should be soft without sticking to your hands or the mixing bowl. Once the dough ball is formed, knead the dough for another 5 to 7 minutes. The additional kneading helps generate more gluten, and gluten is what gives the bread its signature texture!
Cover the dough with a clean kitchen towel, and let it proof at room temperature for 1 hour, or until it doubles in size.
While the dough is proofing, grease two loaf pans with butter, and set them aside. I usually just rub a cold stick of butter along the sides and bottoms of the pans.
Once the dough is done with the first hour of proofing, punch it down, and put it back in the mixer. Mix the dough on low speed for 3 to 5 minutes to get rid of any air bubbles. Divide the dough in half. Shape each half into a loaf, and place into each of your greased loaf pans.
Cover the loaves once again with your clean kitchen towel, and let them proof for another 30 minutes at room temperature, until almost doubled in size. (The dough will continue to rise during baking as well.)
While the dough is proofing, place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 375°F. Before putting the loaves in the oven, quickly brush the tops with oil. Bake for 30-35 minutes. If the color of the bread gets too dark, tent the loaves with aluminum foil.
After baking, carefully take the loaves out of the baking pan, and let them cool on a rack. If not, hot steam will moisten the crust, which you don’t want!

Keeping the speed at “stir,” slowly add the water in a few separate batches (you may need more or less depending on the humidity in your kitchen).
Knead the dough for 15 minutes. The dough should be sticky, but not stick to the sides of the bowl. Cover the dough, and let rest for 30 minutes. This can be done by hand if you don’t have a mixer. Just knead the dough for 5-10 minutes longer.
On a clean, lightly floured surface, form the dough into a long flat loaf shape, about 1/4-inch thick and 4 inches wide. Take the time to make it truly uniform. Place it in the center of a large piece of plastic wrap on a baking sheet or long, flat plate. Wrap the dough, tucking the two ends of the plastic under the loaf, and ensuring that the dough is completely covered. Refrigerate overnight.
In the morning, take out the dough and let it sit on the counter (wrapped) for 1-3 hours until the dough is completely back to room temperature and VERY, VERY soft to the touch. This step is critical, and may take longer in the colder months. If you don't let the dough come back to room temperature, it won't fry up properly.
Now prepare the oil for frying using your wok. You can also use a large pan with some depth for added safety. The goal is to have a large vessel, so that you can produce authentically long crullers. Use medium heat to slowly bring the oil up to 400-425°F/205-220°C.
While the oil is heating up, you can unwrap the dough. Gently flip the dough onto a lightly floured surface, peeling off the plastic wrap. Very lightly flour the top side of the dough also. Next, cut the dough into 1-inch wide strips (try to cut an even number of strips). Then stack them two by two, and press the center, lengthwise, with a chopstick. Hold the two ends of each piece, and gently stretch the dough to a 9-inch long rope.
Once the oil is up to temperature, carefully lower the stretched dough into the oil. If the oil temperature is right, the dough should surface right away. Now take a long cooking tool (we used chopsticks, but you could also use tongs), and quickly roll the dough in a continuous motion for about a minute.
You can fry one to two at a time. Just be sure to take the time to continuously roll the dough in the oil. The youtiao is done once they turn light golden brown. Try not to over-fry them as they become unpleasantly crunchy rather than chewy and delicious.

Chocolate Nutella Rolls - An Asian Milk Bread Recipe,Judy,https://thewoksoflife.com/chocolate-nutella-rolls/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/nutella-rolls-16-1.jpg,"['⅔ cup heavy cream ((160 ml, at room temperature))', '1 cup milk ((235 ml, at room temperature))', '1 large egg ((at room temperature))', '½ cup sugar ((100g))', '½ cup cake flour ((70g))', '3½ cups bread flour ((500g))', '1 tablespoon active dry yeast ((11g))', '1½ teaspoons salt ((7g))', '½ cup cocoa powder ((75g))', 'Nutella ((about 1 tablespoon for each bun))', 'Egg wash ((1 egg whisked with 1 teaspoon water))', '2 tablespoons sliced almonds', '2 teaspoons sugar ((8g, dissolved in 2 teaspoons of hot water to make a simple syrup))']","In the bowl of an electric mixer, add the ingredients in the following order: heavy cream, milk, egg, sugar, cake flour, bread flour, yeast, salt and cocoa powder. Using the dough hook attachment, turn the mixer on at the lowest setting. Let the dough come together for 15 minutes, occasionally pausing the mixer to push the dough together with a rubber spatula. If you're in a humid climate, and the dough is too sticky, feel free to add a little more flour 1 tablespoon at a time until it comes together. If you don't have a mixer and would like to knead by hand, extend the kneading time by at least 5-10 minutes.
After 15 minutes of mixing, the dough is ready for proofing. Cover the bowl with a damp towel and place in a warm spot for 1 hour. I proofed the dough in my oven (I had the oven on rapid proof for 5 minutes, turned the oven off, and then closed the oven door). The dough will grow to 1½ times its original size. (Just so you know, in some cases, readers have reported that their proofing takes slightly longer than 1 hour.)
In the meantime, prepare 16 4” x 4” pieces of parchment paper and a large baking sheet.
After the dough finishes proofing, put the dough back in the mixer, and stir for another 5 minutes to get rid of any air bubbles.
Dump the dough onto a lightly floured surface, and cut into 16 equal pieces. To assemble the buns, follow the photos. Roll each piece of dough out into a rough rectangle, and spread each piece with a tablespoon of nutella. Partially slice the rectangle into ½ inch strips, keeping them all connected at one end. Then roll them over diagonally, and curl the resulting cigar-shape into a snail-shape.
Once shaped, lay each bun on a prepared piece of parchment paper and arrange them on the baking sheet with at least 2 inches of space between them. Let the buns proof for another hour.

Mix all of the ingredients together using an electric mixer (or by hand) to form a soft and smooth dough. Cover and let rest for 30 minutes. While the dough is resting, make the pastry dough.
For the pastry dough:
Mix all of the ingredients together in a bowl using a rubber spatula. Make sure everything is evenly mixed. Cover and refrigerate for 15 minutes.
Assemble the da bing:
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.
Divide the dough into 10 equal pieces. Then also divide the pastry dough into 10 equal pieces and roll each into a ball while it’s still chilled.
Flatten the dough ball and wrap the pastry dough ball inside it. Pinch the outer layer closed. Flatten with the palm of your hand, and roll out into an oval shape, about an eighth of an inch thick. Fold the oval in half lengthwise, and roll into a coil. Turn the roll on its side, flatten with the palm of your hand once again, and roll into another oval. This step creates some ""lamination"" in the dough, which will give you flaky layers in your da bing.
Place the da bing on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Brush lightly with water, and sprinkle generously with an even layer of sesame seeds, pressing them lightly into the dough.
Bake the da bing for 18 minutes until lightly golden brown. Be careful not to overbake them.

The Perfect Whole Wheat Mantou Recipe,Judy,https://thewoksoflife.com/whole-wheat-mantou/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/whole-wheat-mantou-9-1.jpg,"['1 ⅔ cups warm milk ((400 ml))', '1 teaspoon active dry yeast ((3 grams))', '1 tablespoon sugar ((12 grams))', '2 ¾ cups all-purpose flour ((400 grams))', '1¼ to 1½ cups whole wheat flour ((about 170-200 grams; how much you’ll need is dependent on the humidity in your kitchen))']","Heat the milk until warm to the touch (not hot). Then stir in the yeast and sugar until it dissolves. Combine the milk mixture with 2 ¾ cups of all-purpose flour in a large mixing bowl. The mixture will be wet. Cover with a damp cloth and let proof in a warm spot for 1-2 hours until the mixture doubles in size. Since it’s winter, I let the dough proof near a heat vent!
Now mix in the whole wheat flour, a quarter cup at a time, until the dough is smooth, soft, pliable, and not sticky. Cover the dough, and let it rest for 20 minutes.
Now, prepare your steamer with cold water. Make sure the water doesn’t touch the mantou during steaming. Brush the steam rack with a bit of vegetable oil, or prepare 12 small (3” x 3”) squares of parchment paper to prevent the mantou from sticking to the steam rack.
Now knead the dough and divide it into 12 equal pieces using a kitchen scale. Form each piece into a ball. You can also roll the dough into a long tube and cut it into 12 equal pieces. Space the mantou out on a steaming rack about 1-inch apart. You will need 2-3 racks, or you can steam them in a few separate batches.
Let the mantou rest in the steamer for 30-45 minutes until the dough doubles in size before turning your stove on to high to start the steaming process. Steam for 15 minutes using high heat, then turn off the heat, and wait 5 minutes before opening the lid to check your mantou. The last step will ensure your mantou come out full and smooth! Otherwise, they will collapse and look lumpy.
You can enjoy these mantou immediately or store them in a plastic bag after they’ve cooled completely. They will last about a week in the refrigerator, or you can freeze them.

Red Bean Bread,Judy,https://thewoksoflife.com/red-bean-bread/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/red-bean-bread-91-1.jpg,"['8 ounces dried adzuki beans ((225g))', '¾ cup sugar ((150g))', '6 tablespoons butter ((85g))', '2/3 cup heavy cream ((160 ml, at room temperature))', '1 cup milk ((plus 1 tablespoon, at room temperature; total 250 ml))', '1 large egg ((at room temperature))', '1/3 cup sugar ((75g))', '1/2 cup cake flour ((70g))', '3 1/2 cups bread flour ((500g))', '1 tablespoon active dry yeast ((11g))', '1 1/2 teaspoons salt ((7g))', 'Egg wash ((whisk together 1 egg with 1 teaspoon water))', 'simple syrup ((optional: 8g/2 teaspoons of sugar dissolved in 2 teaspoons hot water))']","First, make the red bean paste:
Start by washing and rinsing the red beans prior to soaking. Soak the red beans overnight. When you're ready to start cooking the paste, pour the red beans and water into a medium-sized pot. Ensure that the water level is about ¼"" above the red beans. Bring to a boil, then turn down the heat to simmer. Cook the beans until completely softened. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.
Since we are making a paste, you don't want a lot of liquid in the beans. Most of the water should be cooked off and the beans should be very thick before you move forward. Be careful, because as more water cooks off, burning the beans is very easy to do. This whole process will take a few hours.
When the beans have a thick consistency, transfer to a food processor. Depending on the size of yours, you may need to process the bean mixture in batches. Process until the mixture is totally smooth. If you like your red bean paste chunky, skip this step or process to desired consistency. Transfer the paste back to the pot.
Heat the paste over medium-low heat. Add the sugar and stir to dissolve. Then add the butter. More butter means a richer paste. You can also use vegetable oil at this step, but butter adds a more pleasant flavor. Cook for an additional 15-20 minutes to cook off even more moisture from the paste.
Quick disclaimer here: It won't look like the packaged red bean paste you get at the store because those pastes have enormous amounts of sugar and oil added to make them sticky and dark. We're going for a more natural Chinese bakery red bean paste here. If you like the store-bought red bean paste, feel free to take a shortcut and use that!
Set aside and let cool for an hour or so before using. Do not refrigerate!
To make the milk bread dough:
To save time, make the milk bread dough while the red bean paste is cooking. In the bowl of a mixer, add the heavy cream, milk, egg, sugar, cake flour, bread flour, yeast, and salt. Use the dough hook attachment, and turn on the mixer to “stir.” Let it go for 15 minutes, occasionally stopping the mixer to push the dough together. If you're in a humid climate and the dough is too sticky, feel free to add a little more flour 1/4 cup at a time until it comes together. The dough should be moist, but not so sticky that it sticks excessively to the bowl or dough hook. If you don't have a mixer and would like to knead by hand, extend the kneading time by 5-10 minutes.
After 15 minutes of mixing, the dough is ready for proofing. Cover the bowl with a damp towel and place in a warm spot for 1 hour. The dough will grow to 1.5X its original size.
Assemble the red bean bread:
Grease one standard loaf pan on all sides with butter. Also, line a cookie sheet with parchment paper.
After the hour of proofing, put the dough back in the mixer and stir for another 5 minutes to get rid of air bubbles. Dump the dough on a lightly floured surface, and cut it in half. Set aside one half for a red bean swirl loaf, and cut the other half into 8 pieces for individual red bean buns.
We'll start with the buns. Here's where the fun part comes in. For each bun, use about 2 tablespoons of red bean paste. For a standard red bean bun, just roll one piece of dough into a ball, flatten with your hand or roll out to half inch thickness and place the red bean filling in the center. Pinch the dough closed around the red bean and place on your cookie sheet, seam-side down.
To make some slightly more interesting shapes, just follow along with the pictures! You can roll them like cinnamon buns, and then make strategic cuts with scissors to add a decorative flair. Check out this post to see how to make the pretty swirl shape shown here.
Okay, now for the red bean swirl loaf. Take the first half of dough and shape into a rectangle. Roll out to a little less than ¾-inch thickness with a floured rolling pin, maintaining a rectangle shape. Now, take a few big dollops of red bean paste and spread over the center of the rectangle, leaving a few inches on either side of the rectangle and one inch along the top and bottom. The paste should be spread to about 1/8-inch thickness.
Fold over each side of the rectangle so a seam runs down the center of the dough. Pinch all the open edges closed.
Next, roll out the dough to flatten the seams and make the rectangle of dough roughly as large as it was when you started. Then, fold the dough into thirds (like you would if you were folding a piece of paper to put into an envelope). Roll it out into a rectangle once more. Add more flour to the dough/board if necessary.
Repeat the step of folding the dough into thirds, but this time, roll it out just so that the layers press together and the piece of dough is the length of the loaf pan. Make two lengthwise cuts in the dough so you have three segments. Braid the pieces with the layered sides facing up. This will make for a really nice pattern when it bakes up. Pinch the ends of the braided dough together and gently place into your buttered loaf pan.
Let the buns and the loaf proof for another hour. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Brush the risen dough with egg wash. Bake the buns for 18-20 minutes and the loaf for 35-45 minutes. Remove from the oven and brush the bread with sugar water to give them a really great shine, sweetness, and color.
These don't keep for too long, so if you don't gobble them up right away, best to store them in the refrigerator and then heat them up in the microwave for 20 seconds. The red bean swirl loaf is excellent sliced, toasted, and served with a little butter.
If you have red bean paste left over, it keeps really well in a tupperware in the fridge. If you want to make another batch of these buns, when the time comes, just warm up the paste ever so slightly in a small pot—just enough to make it easily spreadable.",en-US,"{'calories': '298 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '46 g', 'proteinContent': '8 g', 'fatContent': '9 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '5 g', 'cholesterolContent': '37 mg', 'sodiumContent': '271 mg', 'fiberContent': '3 g', 'sugarContent': '14 g', 'servingSize': '1 serving'}",4.63,,The Woks of Life,405,16 serving(s)
Veggie Pizza and Kaitlin's Perfect Pizza Method!,Kaitlin,https://thewoksoflife.com/veggie-pizza-2-variations-kaitlins-perfect-pizza-method/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/pizza-4-1.jpg,"['2 1/2 cups warm water', '1 tablespoon sugar', ""2 1/4 oz. packets active dry yeast ((if you're using bulk yeast, use 4 1/2 teaspoons))"", '1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil', ""7 cups bread flour or all-purpose flour ((or a blend of the two! I've achieved excellent results with all combos))"", '1 level tablespoon fine sea salt', 'Your favorite jarred or homemade tomato sauce ((warmed))', '1 small onion ((sliced thinly))', ""1 block of mozzarella cheese ((grated, we prefer regular ol' mozz over fresh for these pizzas but feel free to go with fresh!))"", '1 cup grape tomatoes ((halved))', '1 small potato ((sliced into extremely thin rounds and tossed with olive oil, salt and pepper))', '1/3 of a Japanese eggplant', '3 cups spinach leaves (roughly chopped)', 'Large handful of fresh basil ((torn))', 'Salt', 'Freshly ground black pepper', 'Extra virgin olive oil', '2/3 cup ricotta cheese', '1/4 cup sun-dried tomatoes ((roughly chopped))']","To make the dough:
In a large bowl, dissolve the sugar in the warm water. Mix in the yeast with a fork, breaking up big clumps, and follow with the olive oil. Give it a quick stir and allow to sit for 15-20 minutes, until it's uber- foamy and puffed up in the bowl!
When it's good and foamy, start adding your flour one cup at a time, stirring with a wooden spoon or spatula. After the first cup, sprinkle the salt over the mixture evenly. Keep adding flour. After adding the fifth cup, assess your consistency--if it's still quite wet, inch towards 6 cups. If it's dry enough to start kneading, dive in with floured hands. I always leave some flour allowance between what I add during the mixing phase and the total stated because you're going to add flour as you knead.
Knead the dough for 5-10 minutes, adding flour to make the dough smooth and elastic. It will stick to your hands in the beginning; just scrape it off and add more flour as you go. It's helpful to measure out your remaining amount of flour (so 7 cups minus what you've already added before kneading) so you don't surpass the maximum amount required as you marvel over your lovely dough.
When the dough is smooth and elastic, and there are no more excess dough bits at the bottom of your bowl, sprinkle some fresh flour in the bottom of the bowl and on top of your dough, cover with a warm damp cloth, and let rise in a warm room or a closed oven for 1 hour, or until doubled in size.
At this point, you can punch the dough down, or cover the bowl with plastic wrap and put it in the fridge until you’re ready to use it. I like to use it right away because a dough that sits in the fridge too long starts to develop an unpleasant yeasty flavor, though others would probably contradict me.
When you’re ready to roll out the crust, preheat your oven to 500 degrees. If you're using a stone, make sure that's in the oven. Liberally flour your board prior to rolling out your dough. I can't emphasize this enough, because if you'll be sliding your pizza onto a stone in the oven, it will need to be jiggly enough on your cutting board when weighed down with toppings to slide oh-so-effortlessly onto the stone. Seriously. You've been warned. You should be using a wooden board, will which act as your MacGyver-ed pizza peel, if you're going the pizza stone route. If you're using a sheet pan, just roll the dough out on the pan.
Okay, now comes the tricky part. Rolling out the dough. Seems simple--just grab your rolling pin and squidge the hell out of it until it's a neat circle, right? WRONG.
When you start with your gob of dough, you want to roughly shape it with floured hands into a flattish circle. At this point it will be thick--about an inch. Then you want to go in with the fists. We're talkin' pizzeria level technique here--but it's seriously not hard! Just place the dough on your two fists and imagine that your making tiny little vertical fist pumps with your hands rotating slightly. As you do this, the dough will naturally stretch by its own weight. Better yet, the dough will stretch from the center (i.e. where your fists contact the dough), which means that you'll end up with a slightly thicker edge. That's your crust! Now your job is to make sure the dough stretches evenly and that no holes are allowed to punch through your lovely dough. You'll want to do this until the dough is about a quarter inch thick. Unevenness within a range of 1/8""-1/4"" is totally fine. In fact, it's your friend. Lay the dough down on your liberally floured board.
If you're one of those people that is adamant about your pizza being, in fact, a circle, now is when you grab the rolling pin. Use the pin to roll out from the center, never allowing the pin to squish your crust. Rolling the dough out shouldn't be in a traditional Paula-Deen-pie-crust way, but with the pin angled to follow the radius of the dough until you've achieved a circle with a raised crust. So you're not rolling out from the center, you're rolling around to follow the circle of the dough. Again, never letting the pin crush the crust. This means the pin should be angled ever so slightly at about 15-20 degrees to preserve crust height. If you see air bubbles--excellent, use the pin or your hands to gently push them to the edges (THESE WILL BE CRUST BUBBLES!).
Now. You're ready for toppings.
To make the Veggie Supreme Pizza:
Grab your sauce. Spread it evenly on your pie. Sprinkle over the sliced onions, followed by half of the mozzarella cheese you want on the pizza. Sprinkle over some grape tomatoes, followed by the potato and eggplant rounds, spinach, and basil. Sprinkle with more mozzarella, season with salt and pepper, and drizzle with olive oil. Bake for 10-14 minutes at 500-550 degrees F.
To make the Spinach and Sun-Dried Tomato White Pizza:
Spread a thin layer of olive oil over your crust. Spread on a layer of ricotta cheese, and sprinkle with onion and cherry tomatoes. Sprinkle on half the mozzarella you want on the pie, followed by the spinach, basil, and chopped sun-dried tomato. Sprinkle with more cheese, season with salt and pepper, and drizzle with olive oil.

Mix together all of the marinade ingredients and rub the marinade all over the duck. It would be best to let the duck marinate overnight, but not essential.
Use the Pizza dough recipe featured in our Wild Mushroom & Garlic White Pizza. The dough recipe makes enough for 4 small pizzas, but the leftover dough can be frozen for use next time.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and place the duck on a foil lined sheet pan. Roast the duck for about 45 minutes and finish under the broiler to crisp the skin a bit. Once cooled, take the meat off the bone and shred it with a fork or just with your hands. Put about a tablespoon of hot water on the roasting pan and use a rubber spatula to deglaze it. Toss the meat in with the juices and duck fat (we don't play around here). If you're a little squeamish about the amount of duck fat on the pan, then drain some off before you deglaze it. Set your lovely duck aside.
In a small sauce pan over low heat, add the water, soy, hoisin, rice wine vinegar, honey, salt, and five spice, and heat until it's thick enough to coat a spoon. Set aside. Preheat your oven to the highest temperature it can muster. You probably won't be able to reach the pizzeria's oven temperatures but try to come as close as possible. We got our oven in Beijing to almost 475 degrees F.
This recipe makes about 2 medium sized pizzas. For each pizza, roll out your pizza dough on your baking sheet and brush on a thin layer of your sauce. You can use some the drippings from the duck pan for this purpose as well. Sprinkle with cheese and shredded duck, and dot with fig slices.
Bake for 10-15 minutes, depending on how hot your oven is. Toss your arugula lightly with extra virgin olive oil, salt, and pepper, and sprinkle over the finished pizza. Drizzle the pizza with a little more of your sauce, and serve!",en-US,{},-1.0,,The Woks of Life,240,4 serving(s)
Chinese Sausage Buns (Lop Cheung Bao),Bill,https://thewoksoflife.com/chinese-sausage-buns/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/chinese-sausage-buns-9-1.jpg,"['3/4 cup warm water', '1 teaspoon instant yeast ((3g))', '1 tablespoon granulated sugar ((12g))', '1 tablespoon canola oil ((plus 1 teaspoon))', '2 cups all purpose flour ((you can use bleached flour if you like, 272g))', '2 tablespoons cornstarch ((20g))', '¼ teaspoon salt ((3g))', '1/8 teaspoon baking soda ((1g))', '10 Chinese sausages ((lop cheung))']","In a small bowl, whisk together the water, yeast and sugar until the yeast dissolves. Let the mixture sit until the yeast “blooms” and foams (about 15 minutes). Stir in 1 tablespoon oil and set aside.
Whisk together the flour, cornstarch, salt, and baking soda in a medium-sized bowl, and stir in the yeast mixture using a spatula. After the dry and wet ingredients are incorporated, knead the dough with your hands (or in your mixer) until the dough becomes smooth and soft. If the dough looks sticky, add a bit more flour 1 tablespoon at a time, and continue kneading until the dough is smooth and soft. The dough should be soft, but not sticky.
Coat the dough with 1 teaspoon of oil and cover with plastic wrap. Let the dough proof at room temperature until it has doubled in size (about 1 hour).
While the dough is proofing, prepare your steaming device/setup of choice. (Check our Chinese cooking tools page for steamer setup options using a steamer rack in a wok or a multi-level metal steamer, both of which we use regularly in our kitchen.) Place the lop cheung (Chinese sausages) on a heatproof plate and steam for 10 minutes. Let cool.
For this recipe, we called for a whole lop cheung in each bun, but if you feel this is too much, just split them lengthwise after they’ve steamed and cooled and use half a chinese sausage for each bun!
After the dough is finished proofing, punch the dough down and knead it for a few minutes to get rid of all the air bubbles. Portion the dough into 10 equal balls and shape each ball into a long strip, measuring 10 inches long. Wrap each length of dough around one lop cheung so the dough overlaps. Tuck in the loose ends. This is the same method used in our recipe for Chinese Hot Dog Buns.
Place each bun on one of your prepared rectangles of parchment paper, and place the buns into your steamer. Cover with a damp kitchen towel to keep the dough from drying out, and let rest for 20 minutes.
Place the buns in the steamer with 1½ inches of cold water, and turn the heat on high. Once you can see steam coming out, turn the heat down to medium, and let the buns steam for another 10 minutes until they have expanded in size.
Remove the steamer from the stove. Let the buns rest inside the steamer for 5 minutes--do not remove the cover. This is an important step, because if you remove the cover too early, the buns will collapse and lose their fluffy shape!

In a small saucepan over low heat, add the oil. Throw in the scallion pieces, star anise, and Sichuan peppercorns. Keep the pan over low heat for about 10 minutes, until fragrant. Pick out all the spices, so you essentially have a pot full of spiced oil. Stir in the flour and five-spice powder to create a thin roux. Set it aside, and let it cool completely.
Make the dough:
In a mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the flour and add the boiling water. Mix with a fork or a pair of chopsticks. Gradually add the cold water and knead everything together to form a smooth dough ball. Cover with a damp cloth and let it rest for 30 minutes.
Assembly:
Depending on the pancake size you want, divide the dough into 4-8 equal pieces. Lightly brush some oil on a clean work surface. Roll each piece of dough into a long rope, and then use a rolling pin to roll it flat. Brush a thin layer of the roux all over the dough, and then sprinkle it sparingly with sesame seeds, chopped scallion, and salt.
Start on one end and roll the dough up. Stand the roll upright and press it down with your palm. Lightly roll out the resulting circle until you get a pancake that’s between 1/4-1/2” thick. It’s ok of the outer edges break open a bit. Repeat for each pancake.
At this point, you can cook them, or freeze them by separating each pancake with a layer of plastic wrap or wax paper, and then putting them in a freezer bag. There’s no need for thawing when you want to cook them.
To cook the pancakes:
Heat a pan over medium heat and add a tablespoon or two of oil. Place the pancake in the pan. Once the bottom starts to turn a little golden, add two teaspoons of water to the sides of the pan (don’t pour the water on the pancake), and immediately cover with a lid. Cook 3 minutes. Uncover the pan, flip the pancake, and do the same steps with the other side.
To finish, uncover the lid again, turn up the heat slightly, and brown both sides while flipping the pancake occasionally. When it’s golden brown, use a pair of chopsticks to squeeze and pinch the pancake a couple times to loosen the layers (this step is optional), because you ideally want to see the layers when you hand-pull it apart. The cooked pancake should be crispy and slightly chewy.",en-US,"{'calories': '430 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '68 g', 'proteinContent': '10 g', 'fatContent': '13 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '1 g', 'sodiumContent': '299 mg', 'fiberContent': '4 g', 'sugarContent': '1 g', 'servingSize': '1 serving'}",5.0,,The Woks of Life,55,4 serving(s)

Once you have a smooth dough, place it into a large floured bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let rise in a warm room for 1-2 hours, or until doubled in size.
When you’re ready to make the pizza, preheat your oven to 500 degrees. In a bowl, toss together the olive oil, garlic, and mushrooms. Let sit for a few minutes. Roll out or shape your pizza however you like. Spread some of the oil, garlic, and mushrooms across the dough, and dot with slices of mozzarella cheese.

In a small pot over medium low heat, dry roast the whole peppercorns of your choice for 15 minutes, until very fragrant. Take care not to burn them, adjusting the heat as needed. Cool completely and use a spice grinder or mortar and pestle to grind the peppercorns down to a powder.
In the same pot over medium heat, dry roast the salt until it turns slightly yellow in color. Let it cool and combine it with the ground pepper. You now have your own authentic salt and pepper powder, which you can use in whatever “salt and pepper” dish you like. The rest of the recipe is really easy.
To prepare the dish:
Rinse the shrimp and pat them thoroughly dry with a paper towel. Dredge them in potato starch or cornstarch––whatever you’re using.
Heat the oil in a small cast iron skillet to 375 degrees. Quickly lay the shrimp in the oil with about an inch of space in between each shrimp, and fry the shrimp in batches, cooking each side for 30 seconds. Set aside on a paper towel-lined plate, and sprinkle with salt and pepper powder to taste.
In the wok, heat 2 tablespoons of oil over medium heat. Fry the garlic until just golden brown (careful not to burn it!), and set aside to drain on a paper towel lined plate.
Remove any excess oil from the wok, so there's only a tablespoon or so left (you don’t want to use too much oil at this stage, as this is a “dry” dish). Add the peppers to the wok. Turn off the heat, and add the garlic back to the wok, stir-frying everything together for a minute. Add the shrimp to the wok, and gently toss everything for 10 seconds, sprinkling over a bit more of your salt and pepper mixture.

After 15 minutes, the dough is ready for proofing. Cover the bowl with a damp towel and place in a warm spot for 1 hour. The dough will grow to 1.5X its original size. Check out our original milk bread recipe for photos of this process!

Mix thoroughly and scrape together the dough, then cover with a plate, and proof at room temperature (about 70 degrees F/21 degrees C) for 2 to 3 hours, until the wet dough has expanded with air bubbles (see my picture for comparison).
Once the 2-3 hours have elapsed, put the proofed wet dough back into the mixer. Add 200g (about 1 1/2 cups) all-purpose flour, 5g (1 teaspoon) salt, 50g (1/4 cup) sugar, and 20 g (3 tablespoons) dried milk powder. Turn the mixer on low, and add 1 large egg and 45 ml (3 tablespoons) vegetable oil. The dough should be wet, but can hold its shape. Only if the dough is not wet enough, add the 1 tablespoon water 1 teaspoon at a time, only as needed. You might need slightly more or less water depending on the humidity in your kitchen.
Once the dough is smooth, scrape the dough off the sides of the mixing bowl and the dough hook, into a ball with a rubber spatula. Cover the mixing bowl with a plate, and let it proof inside your microwave or oven (door closed) with a large mug of boiled water for an hour, until it doubles in size. (Note that the microwave or oven should be off––it’s just providing an enclosed environment) While the dough is proofing, grease a loaf pan (9"" x 5"") with vegetable oil.
Next, transfer the dough to a clean and lightly floured surface. I separated the dough into 3 equal pieces and rolled them into 3 mini loaves arranged in the greased loaf pan. Let it proof one last time in your microwave or oven (door closed) with a large mug of boiled water for an hour until it doubles in size. (Again, the microwave or oven should be off.)
When the dough is almost done proofing, preheat your oven to 375 degrees F/190 degrees C. Bake the bread in the middle of the oven for 28 - 33 minutes until the top is golden brown. While the bread is baking, prepare the sugar syrup by mixing 4g (1 teaspoon) sugar with 10 ml (2 teaspoons) water until the sugar fully dissolves. After it’s done baking, brush the bread with the sugar syrup while it’s still piping hot to get that perfect golden rice color. Let the bread cool for 5 minutes before removing it from the pan to a cooling rack.
For storage, keep the bread in zip-lock bag, and it will stay fresh for a few days on the counter.

Add the flour, water, and salt to a mixing bowl and mix until it forms a dough. Knead for 5 minutes. Set aside and cover with a damp kitchen towel to rest.
Then make the filling components. In a small bowl, combine the pork, five spice, cumin, soy sauce, pinch of sugar, and 1/4 teaspoon salt. In another bowl, combine the cabbage, scallion, garlic powder, sesame oil, and white pepper.
Now you're ready to assemble the pancakes. Divide the dough into 8 equal portions and keep the unused dough covered with a damp towel. Next, use a couple drops of oil to lightly oil your work surface--a bamboo or wood cutting board works well. Roll one of the dough pieces into a long, thin rectangle about four inches wide. No need to make it perfect. Very lightly oil the dough and spread on about an eighth of your pork mixture. Then add about 2 tablespoons cabbage to one end. Roll the dough forward like a snail.

Next, pour ½ cup oil into a small cast iron skillet or pan and heat to about 300 degrees. Place pancakes into the pan (we did 3 at a time) and fry until golden. Carefully flip and fry on the other side (about 3 minutes per side). Always be extra careful when working with hot oil.

Wash and peel your turnip/radish. Grate 1 cup.
Make the batter by putting the flour, cornstarch, salt, white pepper, egg, water, sesame oil, and 1 tablespoon of sesame seeds into a mixing bowl and combining thoroughly. Fold in the sausage, shrimp, and grated turnip.

Heat the pan over medium-high heat and add 1 teaspoon of oil to the pan. Sprinkle some sesame seeds onto the pan and spoon about ½ cup of the batter on top of the sesame seeds. Use a spatula to quickly spread it evenly across the bottom of the pan and form a round pancake. Sprinkle some more sesame seeds on top.
Let the pancake cook for about 3 to 4 minutes until golden brown on one side. Flip the pancake and press it down a bit. Add a little more oil to the pan if it’s dried out. Once that side is also golden brown, flip the pancake again and cook on the first side for a minute. Flip again and cook the second side for another minute.

Pour in the boiling water, and carefully stir the flour and water with a rubber spatula until it forms a thick paste. Stir in the butter until well combined. Let the mixture cool for about 20 minutes.
Once the multigrain mixture is warm to the touch and not hot, stir in the honey until thoroughly combined. Stir in the yeast (and vital wheat gluten if using, in that order). It’s important to make sure the mixture truly is lukewarm before adding the yeast. Let stand for 10 minutes to activate the yeast.
Add the all purpose flour, ¼ cup at a time, and knead until the dough ball is smooth. This will take about 10-15 minutes. The dough should be slightly sticky, but should not stick to a rubber spatula. Soft dough makes soft bread, so do not use more flour than necessary!
Use the rubber spatula to clean the sides of the bowl, and form the dough into a smooth ball. Cover the bowl with a plate, and let it rise in a warm place for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until the dough doubles in size.
Once the first proofing is done, sprinkle 1 teaspoon salt over the dough and knead again for another 5 minutes to make sure the salt is evenly distributed.
Shape the dough into a smooth dough ball, cover with a plate, and let it rise again in a warm place for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until the dough doubles in size. If you are proofing the dough in the microwave like I do, you’ll need another large mug of boiling water for the second proofing.
While the dough is proofing, grease 2 loaf pans (9” x 5”) with cold butter and set them aside. I use cold butter, as it’s easier to handle and goes on in a thin layer. I simply take a cold stick of butter, peel back the wrapper, and rub it along the inside of the loaf pans to coat.
After the second proofing is done, cut the dough into two equal portions. Knead and roll each piece into a loaf shape with a smooth top. On a clean work surface, spread the rolled oats in a thin layer.
Very lightly brush the top of the loaves with water and gently flip the moistened top onto the thin layer of rolled oats. The oats will cling to the loaf. Then carefully place the loaves, oat-side up into the greased pans. Allow to rise for 1 more hour before baking, repeating the proofing protocol as in the first and second proofings.
When you’re halfway through the last proofing, preheat the oven to 375°F. When the third proofing is complete, bake the loaves in the middle of the oven for 35 minutes, until golden brown. If you tap the bread, and it sounds hollow, it’s done.

Knead the dough until it forms a soft, smooth ball. Cover the mixing bowl with a damp kitchen towel and proof in a warm spot until the dough triples in size, 60-90 minutes. I proof my dough inside my microwave, with a large mug of just-boiled water next to it and the microwave door closed.
Once the dough is done proofing, add the sea salt, white pepper, and Sichuan peppercorns (or five spice powder). Knead for another 5 minutes, until everything is well-combined. If the stickiness of the dough makes it difficult to work with, oil your hands rather than using additional flour.
Cover the dough with the towel again, and let it rest on the counter for another 15 minutes. At this point, you can very finely chop the scallions (they must be small to distribute evenly throughout the pancake and release more flavor).
Knead the dough one more time for 2 minutes to get rid of any air bubbles. Brush a clean, flat work surface (such as a clean counter or cutting board) lightly with oil. Using an oiled rolling pin, roll the dough into a thin rectangle a little less than ¼-inch (0.6 cm) thick.
Brush the rolled dough with a thin layer of oil, and evenly cover it with the scallions. Roll it up lengthwise into a tight log.
Roll the log into a thinner tube (this also helps reduce air pockets), and roll the tube into a spiral to form a thick disc. Tuck the end underneath.
Use your hands and a rolling pin to press the disc down into a 10” circle. Sprinkle both sides liberally with sesame seeds, making sure the entire surface is covered. Press the sesame seeds into the dough with the palm of your hand. (The dough circle will be very soft, so use a bench scraper or large spatula to help you flip it over before sprinkling the other side with sesame seeds too).
In a large flat bottomed non-stick or cast iron pan with a lid (I used a 12” cast iron pan), add 3 tablespoons of oil and spread it evenly across the pan’s surface. Place the dough circle into the oiled pan. (Lay it over your rolling pin to transfer it to the pan.) Cover and allow it to rest for another 20 minutes, without turning on the heat!
After the dough has rested, turn the heat on to medium, with the lid still on. Set a timer for 12 minutes. After 12 minutes, open the lid and check the bottom. When it’s evenly golden brown, flip the pancake, cover again, and cook for another 6 minutes.
Remove the lid, and cook for another few minutes to dry out the crust.
