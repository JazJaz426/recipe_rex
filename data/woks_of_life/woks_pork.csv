Then fill a pot with cold water and submerge your eggs. Put the pot on the stove and gently bring it to a boil. Once it’s boiling, boil the eggs for 5 minutes. Take them out and put them into a bowl of ice water to cool for 5 minutes before peeling.
After that’s done, boil some more water in a large pot. Add the pork to the boiling water and blanch for about 3 minutes to get rid of excess fat and other impurities. Drain and rinse the meat.
Make sure your wok is clean and dry. Over medium low heat, add about 3 tablespoons of sugar to the dry wok (no oil) and toss the sugar around. You’ll see it start to turn an amber color. Let it melt until it becomes almost a syrup.
Add the meat to the pan in 1 layer (still no oil necessary). Let the meat brown on all sides, about 10 minutes.

Add them to the pan and gently coat them in the sauce, being careful not to break them up. Simmer for another 15 minutes (add water if needed) and then take the eggs out of the pan. Taste the sauce at this point for salt. If it needs a little more, add a dash of soy sauce 1 teaspoon at a time, until it’s right.

Once the oil is heated, turn the heat down to medium, and add the ground pork. Cook it until the meat is lightly browned. Add in the Shaoxing wine, ½ tablespoon light soy sauce, and the sugar. Mix well, turn off the heat, and transfer the cooked meat to a bowl.
Now turn the heat down to low, and add the last 2 tablespoons of oil and the ginger. Cook it for a minute, then add the garlic and fermented black beans. Cook everything for a minute or two, taking care to avoid burning.
Next, add peppers, and turn the heat up to high. Stir fry everything together, and let it cook for a minute uncovered. Then, add in the cooked pork and garlic chives (if you use scapes, you will need to extend the cooking time at the end for 1-2 minutes with the wok lid on) and stir-fry.
Now it’s time to add in the remaining light soy sauce (1½ tablespoons) and the sesame oil. Stir-fry to combine. At this point, you can salt to taste, but the fermented black beans are quite salty--I found that I didn’t need to add any salt. But be fast about it, because the garlic chives cook quickly.

Change the water a couple of times in between. Drain, rinse, and pat the ribs dry with a paper towel. Marinate the ribs with the mashed red fermented bean curd, the liquid from the jar, ½ teaspoon sugar, sesame oil, Shaoxing wine, ¼ teaspoon of ground white pepper, 1 tablespoon minced ginger, and the white parts of the scallions. Cover, and let sit in the refrigerator overnight.
Soak a large dried lotus leaf by submerging the whole leaf under water. Use a large plate or bowl to weigh it down and leave it overnight. Handle with care, since these leaves rip easily!
The next day, rinse and soak 2 cups of glutinous rice for an hour, making sure the water is at least 2 inches above the rice line. At the same time, take the marinated ribs out of the refrigerator and bring them to room temperature.
Rinse the lotus leaf front and back with fresh water. Line your bamboo steamer or large heatproof platter (with at least a 2-3 inch depth) with the lotus leaf.
Next, prepare the steamer with water. Make sure there is enough water in the steamer, but not so much that the water will flood the dish. You can always add boiling water if the water levels are low during steaming. Now cover the steamer and turn on the heat to bring the water to a boil.
Drain the soaked glutinous rice. Combine the drained rice with 1 teaspoon dark soy sauce, 3 tablespoons light soy sauce, salt, the remaining ½ teaspoon sugar, the remaining ¼ teaspoon ground white pepper, and the remaining scallions.
Now, mix in the marinated ribs (and the marinade liquid!) until well combined. Pour onto the lotus leaf, and wrap the outer edges of the leaf over the top of the rice.

Pork Chive Dumplings,Judy,https://thewoksoflife.com/pork-chive-dumplings/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/pork-chive-dumplings-11-1.jpg,"['7 cups all-purpose flour', '2 1/4 cups water', '1/4 cup oil', '1 1/4 lbs ground pork ((565g))', '1 egg', '7 cups Chinese chives ((chopped finely))', '3 tablespoons sesame oil', '1/4 cup soy sauce', 'salt ((to taste))']","Put the flour in a large mixing bowl. Gradually add the water to the flour and knead into a smooth dough. This process should take about 10 minutes. Cover with a damp cloth and let the dough rest for an hour.
While the dough is resting, prepare the filling. Start by adding the oil to a small pot over medium high heat. Heat the oil for about 7 minutes and allow it to cool. This ""cooking"" of the oil is supposed to bring out a nuttier flavor in the filling. This tip comes straight to you from Willy's mother, a Beijing local, and an authority on dumpling-making!
Once the oil is cooled, add the ground pork to a large bowl, along with the egg, chives, sesame oil, soy sauce, and cooked, cooled oil. At this point, you should make and boil a test dumpling and try it to make sure the taste is to your liking. You can then adjust by adding more salt if needed.
Once the filling tastes right to you, begin assembling the dumplings. The best way to do this is to divide the dough into manageable pieces and then rolling each piece into a rope. Cut them into small pieces (in a size similar to if you were cutting gnocchi, or about the size of the top part of your thumb).
Roll the pieces out into circles, and add about 1 1/2 teaspoons of filling to the center (it helps if you have an assembly line going, with one person cutting out the dough pieces, one person rolling it out, and one person filling/folding).
You can then make folds like you see in our other dumpling post, or you can just fold the circle in half and press them together. Willy's method is to fold the circle in half, press it together at the top, and then make two folds on either side. Whatever way works for you...they don't have to be pretty to taste good.
Place the dumplings about a centimeter apart on a parchment-lined baking sheet. When you're ready to cook, bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil. Carefully drop the dumplings into the water and keep them moving, so they don't stick to the bottom of the pot. Bring back to a slow boil, and cook until they float to the top and the filling is cooked through (about 5 minutes).

Allow to sit for 20-30 minutes, while you prepare the rest of the ingredients.
Rinse the rice cakes and drain. If using fresh or frozen rice cakes, you do not have to soak or thaw them. Only soak (according to package instructions) if using dried rice cakes.
Thoroughly wash the baby bok choy (or napa cabbage). Drain, shaking off excess water. If using baby bok choy, separate into individual leaves. If using napa cabbage, cut the large leaves into smaller bite-sized pieces. Also prepare the garlic and scallions.

Start with the room temperature heavy cream, milk, and egg. Then add the sugar, cake flour, bread flour, yeast, and salt, in that order.
Turn the mixer on to the lowest setting to bring the dough together. When a scraggly dough has formed, knead on low speed for 15 minutes. If needed, turn off the mixer to bring the dough together with a rubber spatula. Alternatively, you can stir all the dough ingredients together with a wooden spoon in a large mixing bowl, and then knead by hand for 20 minutes.
The dough should stick to the bottom of the bowl, but should not stick to the sides. If you’re in a humid climate, and the dough is sticking to the sides of the mixing bowl, add more flour 1 tablespoon at a time until it comes together.
Shape the dough into a ball, and cover with an overturned plate or damp towel. Place in a warm spot to proof for 75-90 minutes, or until the dough doubles in size. (A good proofing environment is a closed microwave, with a mug of hot boiled water next to the bowl.)
While that’s happening, make the meat filling. Be sure to dice the pork finely rather than in large chunks, so the buns are easier to fill. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a wok over medium heat. Add the shallot/onion and stir-fry for 2 minutes. Add the sugar, soy sauce, oyster sauce, sesame oil, and dark soy. Stir and cook until it begins to bubble. Add the chicken stock and flour. Reduce the heat to medium low and cook, stirring, for 2-3 minutes, until thickened. Stir in the roast pork.
Turn off the heat, and remove the filling from the wok onto a large plate. Separate the filling into 16 roughly equal piles, to ensure you get an even amount in each bun. Set aside to cool.
After the first proof, knead the dough for another 5 minutes to punch the air out. Dump it onto a lightly floured surface, and shape it into a ball.
Cut it into 16 equal pieces (in half, then quarters, then in quarters again). The best way to ensure you get evenly sized buns is to weigh the entire dough ball, divide the weight by 16, and then weigh out each individual piece to match that weight.
To shape the buns, knead each individual dough ball to punch out any air bubbles and smooth it out. Roll it into a 4-inch circle, with the center slightly thicker than the outer edges.
While assembling the buns, be sure to keep your hands clean. Any grease from the filling on your fingers will make it very difficult to seal them.
Add 1 portion of filling to the bun, and crimp it closed, making sure it’s tightly sealed. Lay them seam side down on baking sheets lined with parchment paper, about 3 inches apart.
Cover with a clean towel and allow to rise at room temperature for another hour.
Arrange two racks in the top and bottom thirds of the oven, and preheat to 400°F/200°C. Brush the buns with egg wash, and sprinkle them with sesame seeds, if using.
Transfer the buns to the oven, and immediately turn down the temperature to 350°F/175°C. Bake for 22-25 minutes, or until golden brown.
Remove from the oven and immediately brush the buns with the sugar syrup while they’re still hot.

Cha Gio (Vietnamese Fried Spring Rolls),Bill,https://thewoksoflife.com/cha-gio-vietnamese-fried-spring-rolls/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/cha-gio-vietnamese-fried-spring-rolls-17.jpg,"['50 g dried mung bean noodles ((1 package))', '1 pound ground pork ((70-80% lean; 450g))', '2 medium carrots ((grated, about 30g))', '1/3 cup rehydrated wood ear mushrooms ((finely chopped, 30g))', '1/4 cup shallots ((finely chopped, 30g))', '1 clove garlic ((minced))', '1 teaspoon ginger ((grated))', '1 egg white', '1 tablespoon fish sauce', '1 tablespoon vegetable oil', '1/2 teaspoon salt', '1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper', '3 teaspoons sugar ((12g - divided))', '1 cup warm water ((250 ml))', '20 dried rice paper wrappers ((bánh tráng))', 'canola or vegetable oil ((for frying))', 'Fresh green leaf lettuce, cilantro, Thai basil, and mint', 'Nuoc cham dipping sauce ((see our Nuoc cham recipe))']","Make the filling:
Soak the dried mung bean noodles in warm water (submerge them completely) for 30 minutes. Drain thoroughly, and cut into ¼ inch pieces.
In a large bowl, combine the noodles, ground pork, grated carrot, chopped wood ear mushrooms, shallots, garlic, ginger egg white, fish sauce, vegetable oil, salt, white pepper, and 1 teaspoon sugar. Mix until everything is uniformly combined.
Wrap the spring rolls:
In a large, shallow bowl or deep plate, dissolve the remaining 2 teaspoons sugar in 1 cup warm water. Sugar is optional but does help the spring rolls to brown when frying.
To wrap each roll, place a rice paper wrapper into the sugar water for about 5-10 seconds, making sure it is completely submerged. Remove it from the water. It will still be quite firm, but it will soften quickly!
Place about 40g of filling in a log shape on one side of the wrapper. Begin tightly folding the wrapper over the filling (no air bubbles!), and roll the spring roll forward 1 complete revolution. Lightly press down on each end of the filling to flatten the rice paper and push the filling together to eliminate any air bubbles.
Fold one side of the wrapper towards the middle of the spring roll. Repeat with the other side. Roll the spring roll forward while tucking in the front to prevent air pockets. The rice paper wrapper will stick to itself. It doesn’t require anything additional to seal. Place the rolls on a plate or sheet pan lined with a clean, dry kitchen towel or parchment paper.
Chill:
Once wrapped, transfer the spring rolls to the refrigerator and chill for at least 1 hour, so they can dry out and firm up. This step helps minimize the wrapper bubbling when frying (though bubbling is normal). Take them out of the refrigerator 15 minutes before frying.
Double-fry the spring rolls:
Heat about 3 cups of canola or vegetable oil in a medium pot to 335°F/170°C (the oil level should be a little over halfway up the sides). Fry the spring rolls in small batches—about three at a time. Make sure they do not touch just after they are placed in the oil as the skins will be sticky until a crust forms. Cook each batch for 5 to 6 minutes, or until light golden brown. (Frying them in small batches prevents them from sticking to each other.)
Use a metal slotted spoon to pull them out of the oil. Drain on a rack, and continue frying. Maintain the correct oil temperature by periodically adjusting your heat.
When ready to serve, refry the spring rolls (yes, they need to be fried twice) at 350°F/175°C for 1 ½ to 2 minutes to make them nice and crispy. Double-frying is important!

Transfer them to an ice bath to cool. Ring out all the water from the vegetables and chop very finely.
In a large bowl, stir together the vegetable, meat, wine, oil, sesame oil, salt, soy sauce, white pepper, and 2/3 cup water. Mix for 6-8 minutes, until very well-combined.
To wrap the dumplings, dampen the edges of each circle with some water. Put a little less than a tablespoon of filling in the middle. Fold the circle in half and pinch the wrapper together at the top. Then make two folds on each side, until the dumpling looks like a fan. Make sure it’s completely sealed. Repeat until all the filling is gone, placing the dumplings on a baking sheet lined with parchment. Make sure the dumplings aren’t sticking together.
If you’d like to freeze them, wrap the baking sheets tightly with plastic wrap and put the pans in the freezer. Allow them to freeze overnight. You can then take the sheets out of the freezer, transfer the dumplings to Ziploc bags, and throw them back in the freezer for use later.
To cook the dumplings, boil them or pan-fry them. To boil, simple bring a large pot of water to a boil, drop the dumplings in, and cook until they float to the top and the skins are cooked through, but still slightly al dente.
To pan-fry, heat 2 tablespoons oil in a non-stick pan over medium high heat. Place the dumplings in the pan and allow to fry for 2 minutes. Pour a thin layer of water into the pan, cover, and reduce heat to medium-low. Allow dumplings to steam until the water has evaporated. Remove the cover, increase heat to medium-high and allow to fry for a few more minutes, until the bottoms of the dumplings are golden brown and crisp.

Smoked Turkey Legs (Disney Copycat Recipe),Kaitlin,https://thewoksoflife.com/smoked-turkey-legs-disney-copycat-recipe/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/smoked-turkey-legs-11-1.jpg,"['1 gallon water', '1 cup salt', '½ cup brown sugar', '3 tablespoons garlic powder', '3 tablespoons onion powder', '3 tablespoons dried thyme', '3 tablespoons dried sage', '1 1/2 tablespoons black pepper', '1 teaspoon ground cloves', '1 teaspoon ground allspice', '1 tablespoon paprika', '1 teaspoon liquid smoke', '10 turkey legs', 'Natural hardwood lump charcoal', 'Smoking wood chips ((e.g. apple wood or hickory))', 'Charcoal grill', 'Charcoal chimney starter']","Combine all of the ingredients for the brine in a large pot and bring to a boil. Let cool. if you're short on time, you can also start by boiling the brine with just 2 quarts of water and then adding ice to cool to 1 gallon of brine.
While that's happening, rinse your turkey legs and set aside in a large container (one that will fit into your refrigerator). You may want to use two separate containers. When the brine has cooled, pour the brine over the turkey legs, making sure they are totally submerged. Cover and refrigerate overnight.
If you want to expedite the process, use a marinade injector, injecting one syringe-full of brine into each turkey leg (1½ syringe-fulls for the larger turkey legs). Then, let brine as usual for 5-6 hours. This way, the turkey legs don't need to brine overnight. Sounds gruesome, but it really expedites the process, and these marinade injectors are pretty inexpensive!
When the turkey legs are ready, heat your charcoal. Your key tools for this recipe are a charcoal grill, a chimney starter, charcoal, and wet wood chips, which provides the smoky flavor. Fill your chimney with charcoal and light the coals with a piece of newspaper. Let heat for a solid 15-20 minutes or so--until the coals are slightly white hot. Also, take 1-2 handfuls of wood chips and soak them in water while the coals are heating.
Pour the coals into the grill and scatter the wood chips around the coals. Lay your grill rack over the coals. Place the turkey legs on the grill rack and close the grill.
chimney-full of coal is enough to start for an average-sized charcoal grill. Add another chimney of coal every 20-30 minutes, depending on the kind of charcoal you're using. Periodically add additional wet wood chips to make more smoke as needed. More wood chips makes more smoke, increasing the ""hammy"" smoked flavor of the turkey legs. You can cater this to your personal preferences. I like a very hammy smoked turkey leg; my aunt prefers more of a natural flavor. Take your pick!
The slow cooking method is key here. Periodically check the turkey legs, turning every once in a while, and make sure the grill maintains a temperature of 300-325 degrees. There is some element of trial and error to this if you're a first-timer; make observations and adjust amounts of charcoal, wood chips, and heat over the course of the cooking time.
Maintain the grill, charcoal, and wood chips, letting the turkey cook for 3 ½ to 4 hours--until the turkey legs have a nice, dark smoky color that a young Chinese girl once thought only existed within the walls of Disney World.

Mix until the chicken absorbs all the liquid. Next, add the toasted sesame seeds, all-purpose flour and cornstarch. Stir to coat, and set aside.
Make the sauce mixture by combining the low-sodium chicken stock, dark soy sauce, regular soy sauce, brown sugar and rice wine vinegar in a bowl or measuring cup. Set aside.
In a wok or pot, boil 6 cups water, and blanch the broccoli for 30 seconds to a minute, depending on whether you like your broccoli soft or crunchy. Drain in a colander and set aside. To keep it super green, you can also transfer them to an ice bath, and then drain and set aside.
Heat the frying oil in a small but deep pot to 335 degrees F/170 degrees C. Carefully drop the chicken pieces into the oil in small batches. Make sure the batter/sesame seeds have really coated all sides of the chicken before frying. The chicken should float at the top of the oil. Fry until light golden brown (about 5 minutes) and transfer to a wire rack or plate lined with paper towels to drain.
Be sure to manage the oil temperature using a thermometer, as it will drop every time you add raw chicken. Continue frying in batches. Once all of the chicken has been fried once, fry the chicken a second time for 3 to 5 minutes until super crispy. Be careful not to burn it!
Heat a clean wok over medium heat. Add 1 tablespoon of oil along with the dried chilies. Cook the chili peppers for about 5 seconds. Add the minced garlic and Shaoxing wine.
Next, add the General Tso’s Chicken sauce you prepared earlier. Bring the sauce to a simmer, and stir in the cornstarch slurry until it thickens to a glossy sauce.

Chinese Sausage Buns (Lop Cheung Bao),Bill,https://thewoksoflife.com/chinese-sausage-buns/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/chinese-sausage-buns-9-1.jpg,"['3/4 cup warm water', '1 teaspoon instant yeast ((3g))', '1 tablespoon granulated sugar ((12g))', '1 tablespoon canola oil ((plus 1 teaspoon))', '2 cups all purpose flour ((you can use bleached flour if you like, 272g))', '2 tablespoons cornstarch ((20g))', '¼ teaspoon salt ((3g))', '1/8 teaspoon baking soda ((1g))', '10 Chinese sausages ((lop cheung))']","In a small bowl, whisk together the water, yeast and sugar until the yeast dissolves. Let the mixture sit until the yeast “blooms” and foams (about 15 minutes). Stir in 1 tablespoon oil and set aside.
Whisk together the flour, cornstarch, salt, and baking soda in a medium-sized bowl, and stir in the yeast mixture using a spatula. After the dry and wet ingredients are incorporated, knead the dough with your hands (or in your mixer) until the dough becomes smooth and soft. If the dough looks sticky, add a bit more flour 1 tablespoon at a time, and continue kneading until the dough is smooth and soft. The dough should be soft, but not sticky.
Coat the dough with 1 teaspoon of oil and cover with plastic wrap. Let the dough proof at room temperature until it has doubled in size (about 1 hour).
While the dough is proofing, prepare your steaming device/setup of choice. (Check our Chinese cooking tools page for steamer setup options using a steamer rack in a wok or a multi-level metal steamer, both of which we use regularly in our kitchen.) Place the lop cheung (Chinese sausages) on a heatproof plate and steam for 10 minutes. Let cool.
For this recipe, we called for a whole lop cheung in each bun, but if you feel this is too much, just split them lengthwise after they’ve steamed and cooled and use half a chinese sausage for each bun!
After the dough is finished proofing, punch the dough down and knead it for a few minutes to get rid of all the air bubbles. Portion the dough into 10 equal balls and shape each ball into a long strip, measuring 10 inches long. Wrap each length of dough around one lop cheung so the dough overlaps. Tuck in the loose ends. This is the same method used in our recipe for Chinese Hot Dog Buns.
Place each bun on one of your prepared rectangles of parchment paper, and place the buns into your steamer. Cover with a damp kitchen towel to keep the dough from drying out, and let rest for 20 minutes.
Place the buns in the steamer with 1½ inches of cold water, and turn the heat on high. Once you can see steam coming out, turn the heat down to medium, and let the buns steam for another 10 minutes until they have expanded in size.
Remove the steamer from the stove. Let the buns rest inside the steamer for 5 minutes--do not remove the cover. This is an important step, because if you remove the cover too early, the buns will collapse and lose their fluffy shape!
After those five minutes have elapsed, transfer the buns to a plate and serve warm!
These Chinese sausage buns freeze and reheat really nicely. Make sure you steam the buns and let them cool completely before freezing. Reheat by placing the frozen buns into a steamer, and steaming for about 10 minutes.",en-US,"{'calories': '324 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '22 g', 'proteinContent': '13 g', 'fatContent': '20 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '6 g', 'cholesterolContent': '49 mg', 'sodiumContent': '505 mg', 'fiberContent': '1 g', 'sugarContent': '1 g', 'servingSize': '1 serving'}",4.93,,The Woks of Life,120,10 serving(s)
Steamed Pork Buns (Baozi),Judy,https://thewoksoflife.com/steamed-pork-buns-baozi/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/pork-baozi-15.jpg,"['5 g active dry yeast ((about 1 1/2 teaspoons, or more precisely, 1.6 teaspoons; best to use weight measurements))', '8 g granulated sugar ((2 teaspoons))', '1 1/2 cups lukewarm water ((355 ml))', '580 g all purpose flour ((about 5 cups, plus extra for kneading and rolling))', '700 g ground pork ((1 1/2 pounds; can substitute ground chicken or beef))', '3 tablespoons water ((45 ml))', '3 tablespoons vegetable oil ((45 ml))', '2 tablespoons ginger ((about 20g, minced))', '1 large onion ((about 200g, minced))', '2 tablespoons Shaoxing wine ((30 ml, can substitute any other Chinese rice wine or dry cooking sherry))', '1 tablespoon dark soy sauce ((15 ml))', '1 tablespoon sweet bean sauce ((甜面酱; can substitute hoisin sauce))', '2 tablespoons ground bean sauce', '1 tablespoon oyster sauce', '1 teaspoon sugar ((4g))', '1/2 teaspoon white pepper', '2 teaspoons sesame oil', '1 1/2 teaspoons cornstarch ((mixed with 1 tablespoon water))', '3 scallions ((finely chopped))']","To make the dough:
In a large mixing bowl or mixer with a dough hook attachment, completely dissolve yeast and sugar in lukewarm water. Wait 10-15 minutes to let the yeast become active and foam up.
Add in the flour ½ cup at a time and knead for about 15 minutes. Adjust the last ½ cup flour accordingly. The dough should be soft––not sticky and not too firm. Once the dough is even and smooth, form it into a ball. Cover it with a damp kitchen towel and let it proof one hour in a warm place. (If kneading by hand, knead the dough until it’s as smooth as a baby’s butt!) While it’s proofing, make the filling.
To make the filling:
Add the ground meat to a large mixing bowl and stir in 3 tablespoons water until well incorporated.
Now preheat the wok or a cast iron pan until it starts to smoke lightly. Add in 3 tablespoons oil, along with the minced ginger and diced onion. Cook over medium heat until the onions soften. Add in the ground pork and turn up the heat, stirring to break up any large chunks. Cook until all the pork turns pale and opaque––there is no need to brown or crisp the meat.
Add wine, dark soy sauce, sweet bean sauce, ground bean sauce, oyster sauce, sugar, white pepper, and sesame oil. With the heat on high, stir everything together until well-combined. Taste the filling and adjust seasoning if needed.
Cook for a couple of more minutes to cook off any remaining liquid. Stir in the cornstarch and water mixture, allowing everything to bubble together for 30 seconds to a minute. Turn off the heat and let the filling cool uncovered. After the filling has cooled, mix in the chopped scallions.
To assemble the baozi (buns):
After the dough has finished proofing, turn it out onto a clean surface dusted with flour. Knead for 2 minutes to get rid of any air pockets. Weigh and divide the dough into 20 equal pieces (each should weigh about 48g-50g).
Take each dough ball, and with a rolling pin, roll it from the edge towards the center, without actually rolling the center of the dough. The goal is to flatten the dough into a round circle with a thinner edge and thicker center. The difference in thickness should be about 1:2. Add some filling to the center.
You can start with a smaller amount of filling until you get the hang of the folding/pleating. The buns are folded with one hand holding the skin and filling, and the other hand pleating the edges of the dough disk like an accordion. As you fold, the goal is to make it all the way around the circle, until you’ve sealed it at the top. You’ll be making about 10-15 folds. Lay the buns on a small piece of parchment paper and put it directly on your steaming rack. Repeat until all are assembled. Let the buns proof (covered) for another 15 minutes before steaming.
If you’d rather not pleat the buns at all, simply pinch the edges of dough around the filling and pinch to seal tightly. Then simply flip the buns seam side down, cover, and proof for 15 minutes.
To steam:
With the buns in the steamer, start with cold water and turn on the heat to medium. Set the timer to 15 minutes.
After 15 minutes, turn off the heat, and keep the lid on. Let the buns “rest” for 5 minutes before opening the lid. Missing this step will cause the buns to collapse.
To store leftovers and reheat:
Once the buns are steamed and cooled completely, pack them in an airtight container. They can be refrigerated or frozen.
Out of the refrigerator, simply microwave the buns for 1-2 minutes. Alternatively, re-steam them for 5 minutes. If re-heating frozen buns, there’s no need to thaw beforehand. Simply steam them for 8 minutes.",en-US,"{'calories': '232 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '24 g', 'proteinContent': '9 g', 'fatContent': '10 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '5 g', 'cholesterolContent': '25 mg', 'sodiumContent': '179 mg', 'fiberContent': '1 g', 'sugarContent': '1 g', 'servingSize': '1 serving'}",5.0,,The Woks of Life,200,20 serving(s)

Place the pot over medium heat, and bring the mixture to a simmer, stirring to dissolve the sugar. The process should only take a few minutes. Shut off the heat and allow to cool completely.
While waiting for the sauce to cool, rinse the pork belly and pat dry thoroughly with paper towels. The pork should be as dry as possible. Arrange the pieces neatly in a shallow, rimmed dish.
Once the sauce has completely cooled, stir in the baijiu or whiskey. Pour the mixture over the pork, making sure the meat is completely submerged. You can even put a clean plate or bowl on top to weight down the meat. Cover tightly and refrigerate for 3 full days, flipping the pork belly once each day to ensure the sauce penetrates the meat evenly.
After 3 days, it’s time to hang them up to cure. Use kitchen string and a bamboo skewer to thread the string through the fat in the pork belly. Tie a knot to make a sturdy loop, and hang the pork belly in a cool dry place. I used our basement, which has optimal temperature and humidity levels (you want the temperature to remain around 50-55 degrees F, and the relative humidity should be around 65%. I kept the window open during the day to let in fresh air. Note: this cured pork belly is best made during the colder months!
Layer some newspaper on the floor to catch any liquid that drips from the pork, and let it dry for 4-6 days until the outer layer is completely dry and the inside is still slightly soft when pressed. To store, put in a freezer bag with as much air removed as possible.
To prepare this pork belly in the most simple (and delicious) way, just add rice and water to your rice cooker as you normally would to cook a batch of white rice.

Set aside for 30 minutes.
Next, make the sauce. Add 1 teaspoon of oil, ginger slices, and star anise to a small saucepan over medium heat, and cook until the ginger starts to caramelize (about 1 minute). Next, add the ketchup. When that starts to sizzle, stir constantly until the ketchup starts to caramelize (about 2 minutes). Take care not to burn the aromatics and ketchup--this step is essential to give the sauce a deeper, more complex flavor.
Next, add the white vinegar, sugar, and the juice from the canned pineapple. Stir until the mixture starts to simmer, and the sugar is dissolved. Turn to the lowest heat and let the sauce simmer and reduce until the sauce just starts to coat a spoon (about 30 minutes). The sauce needs this time for the flavors to meld. The sauce can be cooled and stored at this time, and you can double or triple the amount and store the sauce away in the refrigerator for future meals.
Heat 3 cups of oil to 350F in a small pot for frying. Using a small pot and frying in batches leaves you with less leftover oil to deal with. Always let the oil cool completely and use a fine mesh strainer to strain the oil before storing in the refrigerator.
Mix together the dredging ingredients (flour, cornstarch, salt and pepper) in a shallow dish. Dredge the pork pieces in the flour mixture, dip into the egg, and then dredge with the flour again.
Fry the pieces in batches for about 2 to 3 minutes, or when they just start to get golden brown. Remove them from the oil and transfer to a sheet pan with a slotted spoon or spider.
Once you’re ready to combine everything, refry the pork in batches to crisp up the coating. That's right, they're going to fry for a second time––this prevents the pork from getting too soggy when added to the sauce.
To a clean wok, add 1 tablespoon oil, the bell peppers, and onions. Stir-fry for 30 seconds, and add the sauce and the pineapple. Bring the mixture to a simmer to further thicken the sauce. At this time, you will likely need to add some cornstarch slurry to thicken the sauce further. Add half first and stir for 15 seconds; then decide if you need more. Remember the sauce will thicken more as it cools in the plate, so add only as much as you need.
I have to add another note to this recipe that this sauce is very sweet and very pungent! So at this point, you must taste the sauce and add water to it if it is too strong and by that, I mean too sweet or too sour. Once you have it adjusted to your taste and the desired thickness, especially if you added more water, then go ahead to the next step and add the pork.
Next, add your crispy pork to the sauce, and toss until the pieces are well-coated.

"Carrot Ginger Pork Buns, Two Ways (Bao Zi)",Judy,https://thewoksoflife.com/carrot-ginger-pork-buns/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/carrot-ginger-buns-16-1.jpg,"['5 grams instant dry yeast', '1 teaspoon sugar', '1 ½ cups lukewarm water', '4 cups all-purpose flour ((plus extra for rolling))', '1 cup ground pork', '1 teaspoon sesame oil', '1 tablespoon light soy sauce', '3 tablespoons oil', '¼ teaspoon white pepper', '¼ teaspoon salt', '3 large carrots ((finely grated))', '3 tablespoons oil', '1 cup scallions ((finely chopped))', '2 teaspoons ginger ((grated))', '1 teaspoon salt', '1 teaspoon sesame oil', '1 teaspoon shaoxing wine', '2 tablespoons oil', '¼ cup water', 'a small handful of finely chopped scallion ((optional))', '2 teaspoons toasted sesame seeds ((optional))']","Step 1: Make the Dough
For this step, you need: 5 grams instant dry yeast, 1 teaspoon sugar, 1 ½ cups lukewarm water, and 4 cups all-purpose flour, plus extra for rolling.
In a large mixing bowl or mixer with a dough hook attachment, completely dissolve yeast and sugar in the lukewarm water. Add the flour and knead for about 15 minutes. The dough should be pretty soft and not too firm. If it seems dry, add a little more water. Cover the mixing bowl with a damp kitchen towel and let it proof one hour. While it’s proofing, make the filling:
Step 2: Make the Filling
Combine the following and mix for a few minutes, until the meat mixture resembles a fine paste, then set aside: 1 cup ground pork, 1 teaspoon sesame oil, 1 tablespoon light soy sauce, 3 tablespoons oil, ¼ teaspoon ground white pepper, ¼ teaspoon salt.
Then heat a couple tablespoons of oil in a pan over medium heat and cook the grated carrots (4 cups) for a few minutes until they turn color (they shouldn’t be mushy. Cook until they’re just not raw anymore). Let cool completely.
Combine the pork mixture, the cooked carrots, and the following ingredients: 1 cup chopped scallion, 2 teaspoons grated ginger, 1 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon sesame oil, and 1 teaspoon shaoxing wine. Mix for a couple minutes, until the entire mixture resembles a paste.
Step 3: Assemble the Baozi
After the dough has finished proofing, turn it out on a clean surface dusted with flour. Knead for 2 minutes to get ride of any air pockets. Roll the dough into a long tube and rip off chunks of dough to make individual dough balls. They should be about the size of a golf ball for larger buns, and about half that size for smaller buns.
Take each dough ball, and with a rolling pin, roll from the edge towards the center, without actually rolling the center of the dough. The goal is to flatten the dough into a round circle with a thinner edge and thicker center. The difference in thickness should be about 1:2. Add some filling to the center of each disk (about 1 ½ tablespoons for the larger buns and 2 teaspoons for the smaller ones).
You can start with a smaller amount of filling until you get the hang of the folding. The buns are folded with one hand holding the skin and filling, and the other hand pleating the edges of the dough disk like an accordion. As you fold, the goal is to make it all the way around the circle, until you’ve sealed it at the top. You’ll be making about 10-15 folds. Lay the buns on a floured surface while you finish assembling them. Once assembled, let the buns proof under a clean kitchen towel for another 15 minutes before cooking or freezing.
To freeze, lay the buns on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and put the baking sheet in the freezer. Once the buns are frozen, transfer them to a Ziploc bag, press out as much air as you can from the bag, and freeze for up to two months (to be honest, they'll even last longer than that). To cook, just follow the directions below as if you were cooking them fresh. The cooking times will just be a little longer!
Step 4: Cook!
There are 2 ways to cook your baozi: steaming and pan-frying, or “sheng jian.”
To steam:
I used a double-leveled bamboo steamer. You can use whatever steaming apparatus you normally use, but remember: 1) Boiling water should not directly touch the buns during steaming 2) Avoid sticking by brushing oil on the surface the bun sits on or by laying down some kind of natural nonstick surface. In our case, we used corn husks. Thin napa cabbage leaves will work too. If using a bamboo steamer, brush the sides of the steamer with oil, as the buns expand and might stick to the sides. 3) The surface that the buns sit on should not be solid, like a plate. This will trap moisture and make the buns soggy. There should be some aeration going on. 4) Make sure the lid is tight so you don’t lose any steam.
Start with cold water, and put your buns on the steamer. Turn on the heat to medium. Set the timer for 12-15 minutes for smaller buns and 15-20 minutes for the larger ones. To see if the buns are cooked, press the buns lightly with your finger. If the surface of the dough bounces right back, then they’re done. Keep a close eye on them. Over steaming will cause the buns to collapse, so cooking time is important.
Turn off the heat, keep the lid on, and let the buns “rest” for about 2 minutes before taking them out and eating.
To pan-fry:
Pre-heat a flat-bottomed cast-iron or other seasoned pan over medium heat. Add a couple tablespoons oil and swirl around the pan to coat it evenly. Add the buns to the pan, and let them cook for a few minutes until the bottoms turn golden brown. Once golden, add about 1/4 cup water to the pan and immediately cover with a lid. Turn the heat down to medium low and let the buns steam for 7-10 minutes until all the water is evaporated. Uncover the lid, and toss the buns with scallion and sesame seeds.

Cantonese Style Braised Pork Belly with Arrowhead Root,Judy,https://thewoksoflife.com/braised-pork-belly-arrowhead-root/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/braised-pork-belly-14-1.jpg,"['2 pounds pork belly ((about 1 kg))', '10 arrowhead roots ((or 2 - 3 large potatoes))', '2 tablespoons oil', '2/3 oz. rock sugar ((20g))', '2 pieces red fermented bean curd ((with 1 tablespoon of the liquid from the jar; you might see it labeled as “bean cheese""))', '1/4 cup shaoxing wine', '1 ½ teaspoons dark soy sauce', '5 cups water']","Cut pork belly into large (0.75” x 1.5”) chunks. Bring a large pot of water to a simmer and blanch the meat just until it turns opaque. Drain, rinse, and set aside.
Peel the arrowhead roots. Just trim off the top and bottom, and peel the outer skin. Immediately drop each peeled root into a bowl of cold water to prevent oxidation. If using potatoes, you're going to want to cut them into 1 1/2-inch chunks, but don't cut them just yet (they take less time to cook than the arrowhead).
When you’re ready to cook, take the arrowhead roots out of the bowl of water and cut each in half. Heat the oil in a wok over low heat and add the rock sugar. Let it melt slowly and then add the fermented bean curd/liquid. Stir for a minute. Now add the blanched pork belly and arrowhead roots (if using potatoes, do not add them yet).
Turn the heat to medium and mix everything well. Add the shaoxing wine, dark soy sauce, and 2 cups of water. Stir everything together and cover the lid. Simmer over medium low heat.
Check the pot every 5-10 minutes. As the liquid evaporates, add more water 1 cup at a time and replace the lid. Continue doing that until the meat is fork-tender and the sauce is thickened enough to coat the pork. In my case, it took 5 cups of water, and about 1 hour and 15 minutes to fully cook the pork and arrowhead root. If using potatoes, cut them into chunks and stir them in after the pork has cooked for about 45 minutes.
If the pork is fork tender, but there’s still a lot of visible liquid, uncover the wok and turn up the heat to medium high.

Char Siu (Chinese BBQ Pork),Bill,https://thewoksoflife.com/chinese-bbq-pork-cha-siu/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/char-siu-recipe-11.jpg,"['3 pounds boneless pork shoulder/pork butt ((select a piece with some good fat on it))', '¼ cup granulated white sugar', '2 teaspoons salt', '½ teaspoon five spice powder', '¼ teaspoon white pepper', '½ teaspoon sesame oil', '1 tablespoon Shaoxing rice wine', '1 tablespoon soy sauce', '1 tablespoon hoisin sauce', '2 teaspoons molasses', '1/8 teaspoon red food coloring ((optional))', '3 cloves finely minced garlic', '2 tablespoons maltose or honey', '1 tablespoon hot water']","Cut the pork into long strips or chunks about 2 to 3 inches thick. Don’t trim any excess fat, as it will render off and add flavor.
Combine the sugar, salt, five spice powder, white pepper, sesame oil, wine, soy sauce, hoisin sauce, molasses, food coloring (if using), and garlic in a bowl to make the marinade (i.e. the BBQ sauce).
Reserve about 2 tablespoons of marinade and set it aside. Rub the pork with the rest of the marinade in a large bowl or baking dish. Cover and refrigerate overnight, or at least 8 hours. Cover and store the reserved marinade in the fridge as well.
Preheat your oven to 'bake' at 475 F (246 C) with a rack positioned in the upper third of the oven. (If you only have a convection oven, keep in mind the oven not only heats more quickly, your char siu will roast faster than what we have described here). It's amazing how oven temperatures can vary—from model to model, in different spots in the oven, and in how ovens pre-heat and maintain heat. Using an oven thermometer to double-check the actual oven temperature is a great safeguard to monitor your food (I say double-check because even oven thermostat calibrations vary and can sometimes be incorrect). Regardless, be sure to check your char siu every 10 minutes, reducing or increasing the temperature as needed.
Line a sheet pan with foil and place a metal rack on top. Using the metal rack keeps the pork off of the pan and allows it to roast more evenly, like it does in commercial ovens described above. Place the pork on the rack, leaving as much space as possible between pieces. Pour 1 ½ cups water into the pan below the rack. This prevents any drippings from burning or smoking.
Transfer the pork to your preheated oven. Roast for 25 minutes, keeping the oven setting at 475 F for the first 10 minutes of roasting, and then reduce your oven temperature to 375 F (190 C). After 25 minutes, flip the pork. If the bottom of the pan is dry, add another cup of water. Turn the pan 180 degrees to ensure even roasting. Roast another 15 minutes. Throughout the roasting time, check your char siu often (every 10 minutes) and reduce the oven temperature if it looks like it is burning!
Meanwhile, combine the reserved marinade with the maltose or honey (maltose is very viscous––you can heat it up in the microwave to make it easier to work with) and 1 tablespoon hot water. This will be the sauce you’ll use for basting the pork.
After 40 minutes of total roasting time, baste the pork, flip it, and baste the other side as well. Roast for a final 10 minutes.
By now, the pork has cooked for 50 minutes total. It should be cooked through and caramelized on top. If it’s not caramelized to your liking, you can turn the broiler on for a couple minutes to crisp the outside and add some color/flavor. Be sure not to walk away during this process, since the sweet char siu BBQ sauce can burn if left unattended. You can also use a meat thermometer to check if the internal temperature of the pork has reached 160 degrees F. (Update: USDA recommends that pork should be cooked to 145 degrees F with a 3 minute resting time)
Remove from the oven and baste with the last bit of reserved BBQ sauce. Let the meat rest for 10 minutes before slicing, and enjoy!",en-US,"{'calories': '274 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '14 g', 'proteinContent': '39 g', 'fatContent': '6 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '2 g', 'cholesterolContent': '102 mg', 'sodiumContent': '832 mg', 'fiberContent': '1 g', 'sugarContent': '12 g', 'servingSize': '1 serving'}",4.98,,The Woks of Life,60,8 serving(s)

In a small pot, add the pork skin and pork bones and cover with cold water. Bring to a rolling boil, and immediately drain and rinse off the bones and the skin. This gets rid of any impurities. Rinse out the pot and put everything back in. Add 4 cups (950 ml) water, ginger, scallion and wine. Bring the pot to a boil and then reduce the heat to low. Cover and simmer for 2 hours.
After 2 hours, turn off the heat, allow the soup to cool, and strain the liquid into a bowl. Once the liquid is completely cooled, cover and refrigerate overnight.
The Dough:
In a mixing bowl, add the flour and the warm water 1 tablespoon at a time. Work and knead the dough for 15-20 minutes. The dough should be very soft and smooth. Cover with a cloth and let it rest for 30 minutes.
The Filling:
Take your ground pork and put it in the food processor. Pulse for 30-60 seconds until the pork resembles paste. In a mixing bowl, add the pork and the rest of the ingredients except the aspic. Whip everything together thoroughly, for about 2 minutes. You want everything to be extremely well combined, and the pork should look like a light, airy paste. Gently fold in the diced aspic, and do not over-mix. Cover and transfer the filling to the refrigerator until ready to make the dumplings. If you’re ready now, you can put it in the freezer for 15 minutes to allow it to firm up and make assembling the buns easier.
Assembly:
Lightly dust a clean work surface with flour and roll the dough into a long cylinder/cigar, about an inch in diameter. Cut the dough into small equal pieces weighing about 11 grams each (the dough chunks should be a size resembling that of gnocchi). Roll out each piece into a round disc about 3 - 3 ¼ inches diameter. Keep everything under a damp cloth.
Prepare your bamboo steamer. You can line it with cheese cloth, napa cabbage leaves, or these lovely bamboo steamer discs, which can be found in some Chinese restaurant supply stores (if using these, you must brush the discs with oil first!).
When all that is prepared, take out the filling. You’ll be making each bun one at a time. Place about 1 tablespoon of filling in the middle of your dumpling skin. Pleat with as many folds as you can muster: 12-20 folds should do it. Make sure the top is sealed. If the filling ever gets too wet or hard to handle, put it in the freezer for another 15 minutes and start again.
Place the buns in the lined steamer basket, about 2 inches apart.
Steaming:
In a metal steamer pot or wok, boil water. If using a wok, put the water at a level so that when you put the bamboo steamer into the wok, the water rises about ½ inch up the bottom of the bamboo base. You never want the water to touch the dumplings inside, though, so make sure not to fill it too high!
Once the water is boiling, put the bamboo steamer in the wok or steamer pot, cover with the bamboo steamer lid, and steam over high heat for 8 minutes. Immediately remove the bamboo steamer from the pot and serve.
Eating:
Ok, so there is definitely a proper way to enjoy these dumplings. Put away the soy sauce because it has no place on the table right now. What you want is Chinese black vinegar. Pour some out into a small, round dish or bowl, and top with some very thin matchsticks of ginger.
Take out your two utensils—chopsticks and a Chinese soup spoon (a fork would just butcher these and the soup would dribble out all over the table. It would be a tragedy of Shakespearean proportions).
Carefully, slowly peel the xiaolongbao off of the steamer basket and dip it into the vinegar. Gently transfer the dumpling to your soupspoon and take a tiny bite out of the skin on the side of the bun to make a little hole. Proceed to slurp the soup out of the bun (Carefully. It’s HOT). Then, with a little more vinegar, finish the whole thing off in one bite.",en-US,"{'calories': '294 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '17 g', 'proteinContent': '15 g', 'fatContent': '17 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '6 g', 'cholesterolContent': '54 mg', 'sodiumContent': '503 mg', 'fiberContent': '1 g', 'sugarContent': '1 g', 'servingSize': '1 serving'}",4.81,,The Woks of Life,1470,6 serving(s)

Finely chop the mushrooms. Also mince the ginger and finely chop the scallions, separating the green and white parts.
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a wok over medium heat. Cook the shiitake mushrooms until caramelized, about 4-5 minutes (don’t stir too often; give the mushrooms a chance to caramelize). Don’t overcook the mushrooms, or they’ll turn dry. Set aside and cool completely.
In a large mixing bowl, add the ground pork, chopped scallion whites, minced ginger, Shaoxing wine, light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, sugar, sesame oil, and white pepper. Mix it all together, and whip everything in one direction for 5 minutes. While you’re whipping the filling, add the water 1 tablespoon at a time, until the filling becomes a thick paste, with no standing liquid.
Add the cooled shiitake mushrooms, and keep stirring in one direction for another 3 minutes, until everything is well-combined.
Assemble the dish:
Take each gluten ball, and use a chopstick to poke a hole at a thin/soft spot without penetrating through to the other side. With care, use two chopsticks in a turning motion to make the opening bigger, about 3/8” in diameter and no more than ½”. Use the chopsticks to gently deconstruct the inner “structure” of the gluten ball to make room for the filling, while keeping it intact.
Stuff the gluten ball with the filling a little at a time until there is no more room, all the while keeping the gluten ball whole. Repeat until all are stuffed. This step definitely takes patience and care!
At this point, you’ll have filling left over. However, by now, the filling already inside the gluten balls will have moistened and further broken down the inner structure, creating space for more filling. So repeat the above step and stuff more filling into each ball. You should be able to divide and use up all the filling. If not, pan-fry any remaining filling in a meat patty for a little snack. An under-stuffed gluten ball will not be as round after cooking, but there’s no harm done!
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a wok over low heat. Add the sugar, ginger and scallions, and cook for 1-2 minutes, until the sugar has melted and the aromatics are fragrant.
Add the Shaoxing wine, light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, oyster sauce, 1 star anise, and 2 ½ cups water. Bring to a boil, and then reduce the heat to medium.
Add the stuffed gluten balls, with the openings facing down. Cover, bring to a boil, and reduce the heat to medium low. Simmer for 10 minutes, carefully flipping the gluten balls halfway through the simmering process to ensure they’re cooked evenly.
After 10 minutes, flip the gluten balls so the openings face down once again. Turn up the heat to reduce the sauce. Once the sauce has become a thin gravy (you should have about 3/4 cup of sauce left in the wok), turn off the heat and serve.

Once peeled, rinse them clean and wipe them thoroughly dry. Lightly smash each chunk with the side of a knife or other flat, heavy tool.
In a clean, dry wok over medium heat, cook the ginger for 10 minutes. Be careful not to burn it. If any of the ginger burns, trim away the burnt spots, or the finished dish will be bitter.
Add the ginger chunks to a large non-reactive cooking vessel, along with the two types of vinegar. Cover and bring to a boil. Once boiling, turn the heat down to medium. Simmer for 90 minutes. This is a good time to taste the vinegar mixture––free feel to add more black vinegar for tartness.
While the vinegar and ginger are simmering, take a separate pot and add the pork. Cover it with cold water, and add 2 tablespoons Shaoxing wine. Bring to a boil and boil for an additional 3 minutes. Turn off the heat, drain, and rinse the pork. Set aside.
Once the vinegar and ginger have simmered for 90 minutes, stir in the pork. (If you prepared the vinegar and ginger base in advance, bring it to a boil before adding the pork.)
Cover and cook for another 60-90 minutes over medium heat. You’ll know it’s done when you can easily poke through the pork skin with a chopstick.
While the pig trotters and pork knuckles are cooking, boil the eggs. We came across this rigorously tested method Serious Eats. Bring 3 quarts of water to a boil in a large pot (it sounds like a lot, but it helps get the eggs to the right temperature to be easy to peel). Lower the eggs into the boiling water, and boil for 30 seconds. Cover the pot, reduce the heat to low, and simmer for 11 minutes. Transfer to a bowl of ice water. Once cool, tap the eggs against the counter all over to crack the shell, and peel under a thin stream of running water.

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium/low, and simmer for 15 minutes.
If using pork belly, remove it from the pot to let it cool, and save the stock. If substituting pork ribs, don’t remove them from the stock. Just turn off the heat and let them continue “cooking” in the hot broth while you prepare the rest of the dish.
Make the dipping sauce by combining the minced garlic, light soy sauce, sugar, and chili oil (if using) in a small bowl. Set aside.
Slice the sour cabbage about ¼” (0.6 cm) thick, transfer to a large metal bowl, and fill with fresh water. Agitate the vegetables in the water with your hands a bit, drain, and thoroughly squeeze out any remaining water from the cabbage. This quick rinse will soften the saltiness and sourness of the cabbage. Set aside.
Once the pork belly is warm to the touch (not hot), slice it into 1/4"" (0.6 cm) slices. Set aside.
In a thick-bottomed, relatively shallow pot (a clay pot, stone pot, or cast iron dutch oven is ideal for retaining heat while eating), heat the vegetable oil, and add the ginger, julienned scallion whites, and the sour cabbage. Stir-fry for 5-7 minutes, until any liquid has evaporated.
Strain the liquid used to boil the pork into the pot. Stir in the oyster sauce and chicken stock (optional if you like a more broth-like consistency), and then add the sliced pork belly (or ribs). Bring to a simmer, cover, and cook for 15 minutes over medium low heat.
Add the glass noodles, stir, and cover again. Cook for 2-3 more minutes, or according to the package instructions.

Heat the sugar and water in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir to dissolve the sugar. Once it’s boiling, add the lemon juice, stir, and immediately turn the heat down to low.
Keep the lid off, and let the syrup simmer for about 60 to 70 minutes until the sugary liquid turns a light amber color. Do not stir during this timeframe! By now, the liquid might look too watery, but it will thicken once it’s cooled. Try not to overcook it, because it will become thick like caramel. (Just in case you do overcook the syrup, and it’s too thick, add a few drops of hot water to thin it out. Keep adding the hot water until you get the right consistency.)
Now, pour the syrup into a heatproof container, and cool completely before storing it in the refrigerator.
PART II: The dough
First, mix the inverted sugar syrup, oil, and lye water together. Then add the flour to the mixture, using a rubber spatula to fold and combine everything into a soft dough.
Do not overwork the dough. This step should only take about a minute or two. Cover the dough in an airtight container or wrap it in plastic wrap. Let it rest in the refrigerator for at least an hour to make it easier to work with. You can also refrigerate the dough overnight if you’d like to make it ahead of time.
PART III: The ham and nut filling
Steam the ham in a heatproof bowl for 15 minutes. You will end up with some liquid in the bowl after it’s done steaming. Save this liquid and set it aside. Finely chop the ham.
If you’re using pre-toasted nuts, you can save some time. If not, toast the raw nuts in a preheated oven at 325 degrees F for 5-10 minutes with each batch. Roast the walnuts, cashews, and pecans together, and roast the pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and sesame seeds in a separate batch. My tip is that once you smell a nutty aroma after 3-4 minutes, stand in front of the oven until the nuts are toasted to your liking. Don’t walk away from the oven, because the nuts can burn quickly! Once cool enough to handle, chop the walnuts, cashews, and pecans, and add them to a large mixing bowl along with the toasted pumpkin, sunflower, and sesame seeds.
In a clean, dry wok, toast the sweet rice flour for 15 to 20 minutes over medium low heat until it turns a light brown color. Stir often, and adjust the heat accordingly to prevent burning.
In a small pot, heat up the oil until it’s lightly smoking. Turn off the heat, and let it cool. Believe it or not, cooking the oil this way adds fragrance and flavor to the mooncakes!
To your mixing bowl full of chopped nuts and seeds, add the chopped ham, currants, sugar, salt, and five spice powder. Mix well. Now add in the liquids: the water from steaming the ham, the bai jiu, the “cooked” peanut oil, and the water. Stir everything to combine.
Lastly, slowly add in the toasted sweet rice flour to bind all the ingredients together. The final mixture should be somewhat dry and slightly crumbly, but you should be able to squeeze everything together tightly and form a ball. If you need to, add a little bit more peanut oil to moisten the mixture.
Weigh and divide the mixture into 18 equal pieces. Form each piece into a ball, and set aside for assembling the mooncakes.
Part IV: Assembling the mooncakes
After the dough is done resting, divide it into 18 equal pieces. My mooncake mold holds 100 grams, which means that each mooncake should weigh about 100 grams after assembly. You should be able to use these guidelines when assembling the mooncakes:
Each dough ball is around 25 to 30 grams. Set aside a smaller dough ball for scraps and mending, which I will get to. Shape each piece into a ball.
Each ball of filling should be around 65 to 70 grams.
Let’s start assembling the mooncakes by preparing the mooncake mold. My mooncake mold came with four pattern plates––one plate should be attached to the mold itself. Wrap another one with clear plastic, because you’ll use it to press the mooncake from the bottom. Now, dust the inside of the mold with plenty of flour, and shake off the excess. You’ll need to repeat this process before pressing every mooncake to avoid sticking.
Dust the balls of dough with flour. Take one ball of dough, and roll it out on a floured surface into a 4-inch round. Put one piece of filling in the center. Carefully lift it up (I use a dough cutter to scrape it up from my work surface), and gently press out the air bubbles without breaking the dough. Next, make sure the opening is facing up, and slowly pinch the dough closed around the filling, keeping the distribution of the dough as even as possible.
The dough feels like Play-doh, so it’s easy to break, but it’s also easy to squish back together. These instructions might sound confusing, but follow along with the pictures, and keep in mind that the chief goal here is to close the dough around the filling without any air pockets. Now dust the assembled ball with additional flour.
Place the ball of dough and filling inside the mooncake mold with the mold opening facing up. Next, press in the bottom piece (with the clear plastic-wrapped plate that you prepared). With some pressure, gently press it inward.
Quickly put the mold down, and press the mooncake out with the top pressure bar. The bottom piece will come out no problem, but use your other hand to VERY GENTLY guide the mooncake out of the mold. When/if a small piece of dough gets stuck and does not come out, get a small piece of your scrap dough to patch up the area. Then clean the mold, and dust it well with flour again. Next, gently flatten all sides of the mooncake to make it smaller, so it can go back in the mooncake mold for re-shaping. Use slightly more flour for dusting if this becomes a persistent issue. Place the mooncakes on a baking sheet as you make them.
PART V: Baking the mooncakes
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F, and put the baking rack in the middle of the oven when you’re almost finished assembling the mooncakes. Once the oven is preheated, gently mist the mooncakes with a food-grade spray bottle (if you have one) filled with water. If you don’t have one, you can just use your hands. Dip your fingers into a bowl of water, and fling the water on your fingers onto the mooncakes a couple of times. This prevents the dough from cracking in the hot oven.
Then, immediately put the mooncakes in the oven, and bake for 5 minutes. (Remember to set the timer!) Now, prepare the egg wash by whisking together an egg yolk with 3 tablespoons of water.
After the mooncakes have been baking for 5 minutes, take them out of the oven and immediately lower the oven temperature to 300 degrees. Using a natural-bristle pastry brush, lightly brush each mooncake with egg wash, and put them back in the oven.

Mix together all of the marinade ingredients and rub the marinade all over the duck. It would be best to let the duck marinate overnight, but not essential.
Use the Pizza dough recipe featured in our Wild Mushroom & Garlic White Pizza. The dough recipe makes enough for 4 small pizzas, but the leftover dough can be frozen for use next time.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and place the duck on a foil lined sheet pan. Roast the duck for about 45 minutes and finish under the broiler to crisp the skin a bit. Once cooled, take the meat off the bone and shred it with a fork or just with your hands. Put about a tablespoon of hot water on the roasting pan and use a rubber spatula to deglaze it. Toss the meat in with the juices and duck fat (we don't play around here). If you're a little squeamish about the amount of duck fat on the pan, then drain some off before you deglaze it. Set your lovely duck aside.
In a small sauce pan over low heat, add the water, soy, hoisin, rice wine vinegar, honey, salt, and five spice, and heat until it's thick enough to coat a spoon. Set aside. Preheat your oven to the highest temperature it can muster. You probably won't be able to reach the pizzeria's oven temperatures but try to come as close as possible. We got our oven in Beijing to almost 475 degrees F.
This recipe makes about 2 medium sized pizzas. For each pizza, roll out your pizza dough on your baking sheet and brush on a thin layer of your sauce. You can use some the drippings from the duck pan for this purpose as well. Sprinkle with cheese and shredded duck, and dot with fig slices.
Bake for 10-15 minutes, depending on how hot your oven is. Toss your arugula lightly with extra virgin olive oil, salt, and pepper, and sprinkle over the finished pizza. Drizzle the pizza with a little more of your sauce, and serve!",en-US,{},-1.0,,The Woks of Life,240,4 serving(s)

In a large pot, bring 6 cups of water to a boil. Add the pork ribs. Bring the water back up to a simmer, and after 2 minutes, turn off the heat. Drain and wash the ribs clean under running water. This step is important––it keeps your broth clear and clean tasting.
Put the blanched pork ribs, smashed ginger slices, and 8 cups of water in a clean pot. Bring the water to a boil, and immediately turn the heat down to low. Simmer for 90 minutes, covered. Cantonese soups require low heat for a delicate favor and clear broth. Check on the soup periodically to make sure it is lightly simmering, but not boiling.
In the meantime, prepare the watercress by trimming off the large tough stems, and washing thoroughly in water 2-3 times.
After 90 minutes, stir in 1¼ teaspoons of salt, cover, and simmer for another 30 minutes.
After 30 minutes, give your soup a quick stir, and use a fine-mesh strainer to remove any floating particles. Next, use a ladle to skim off the excess grease that is floating at the top of the soup. Stir in the watercress, cover, and bring up to a simmer. Then lower the heat and cook the soup for 15-30 minutes. I personally like to simmer the watercress soup for 30 minutes at this stage, so the soup takes on that distinctive watercress flavor. Though keep in mind that the watercress will not be as vibrant. Feel free to adjust the cooking time based on your preference.
Season to taste with salt and white pepper. Serve the soup with a hot bowl of rice and a small dish of light soy sauce as a dipping sauce for the pork. After cooking in the soup for so long, the ribs are melt-in-your-mouth tender and perfect with a little soy sauce.

Add the all-purpose flour to the bowl of an electric mixer. With the mixer on low, slowly add the water. Run the mixer until the dough comes together into a smooth ball. 2 cups of water is a baseline. You may need less water in humid climates and more in drier climates/times of year (i.e. winter).
The finished dough should be soft and pliable, but not wet or sticky. Cover with an overturned bowl or plate, and let the dough rest on the counter for 1 hour. This gives the flour more time to absorb moisture, which will make the dough smoother and easier to work with. While the dough is resting, make the filling.
Take a spoon and scrape the fish meat a little bit at a time, discarding the tough membrane that’s left behind. Coarsely chop the fish (no need to make it into a paste-like texture at this stage). Add the fish to a large mixing bowl along with the rest of the filling ingredients. Whip in one direction using chopsticks or a wooden spoon for a good 5 minutes until the filling becomes gooey and sticky. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for 15 minutes.
Now we are ready to assemble the dumplings! When the dough is done resting, cut it into eighths. Take one of your smaller pieces of dough, keeping the rest of the pieces covered to prevent them from drying out. Roll the small piece of dough into a thick cylinder on a clean and lightly floured surface. Cut the cylinder into 10-gram pieces using a kitchen scale. Now take one piece, and roll it from edge to center with a small rolling pin as you turn the dough in a circular motion. The end result is a 3-inch diameter dumpling wrapper that has thinner edges and a slightly thicker center.
Add about a tablespoon of filling to the center, and fold the wrapper in half. Position the dumpling so that each side is held in place by your thumb and index finger (this is a two-handed operation). Then with gentle pressure, press the two sides of the wrappers closed tightly. At the same time, press the filling slightly downward, by bringing your wrists slightly closer. Practice will make perfect! Place the dumplings on a sheet pan lined with parchment paper.
Before you go too far down the road of making the dumplings, now is a good time to pause for a taste test. Boil a small pot of water just as you’re beginning to assemble the dumplings, and cook 2-3 test dumplings according to the cooking instructions below. Taste and adjust the seasoning accordingly before proceeding with the rest of the batch! You may want more Shaoxing wine, more vinegar, more ginger, or more soy sauce, for example.
Before cooking the dumplings, assemble the dipping sauce by combining all the sauce ingredients in a small bowl.
To cook the dumplings, make sure to cook them in small batches, since the filling is somewhat wet and the dumplings will loose their shape when left sitting for too long.
Fill a large soup pot halfway with water. Bring it to a boil. Add the dumplings, stirring the water slowly as you add them to prevent them from sticking to each other. Keep the pot uncovered.
Bring the water to a boil again, and then add 1 additional cup of cold water to stop the boiling process. As the pot of water continues to rise in temperature, repeat this previous step 3 until the dumplings are floating to the surface. The dumplings are cooked once the water has boiled after three instances of adding cold water. Scoop them out with a strainer or slotted spoon, and enjoy them right away with the dipping sauce.

Then make the filling components. In a small bowl, combine the pork, five spice, cumin, soy sauce, pinch of sugar, and 1/4 teaspoon salt. In another bowl, combine the cabbage, scallion, garlic powder, sesame oil, and white pepper.
Now you're ready to assemble the pancakes. Divide the dough into 8 equal portions and keep the unused dough covered with a damp towel. Next, use a couple drops of oil to lightly oil your work surface--a bamboo or wood cutting board works well. Roll one of the dough pieces into a long, thin rectangle about four inches wide. No need to make it perfect. Very lightly oil the dough and spread on about an eighth of your pork mixture. Then add about 2 tablespoons cabbage to one end. Roll the dough forward like a snail. Then stand it on one end so it's like a standing cylinder. Press the dough down into a flat pancake (about 3/4 inch thick, with a diameter of about 3 1/2 inches) with one hand and then sprinkle with sesame seeds. These measurements are just meant to give you a general idea so no need to get out any tape measures!
Next, pour ½ cup oil into a small cast iron skillet or pan and heat to about 300 degrees. Place pancakes into the pan (we did 3 at a time) and fry until golden. Carefully flip and fry on the other side (about 3 minutes per side). Always be extra careful when working with hot oil.
When golden brown, transfer to a plate lined with paper towels. These pancake rolls are best eaten as soon as they come out of the pan, but they can also be placed in the refrigerator or even frozen and re-toasted in the oven.",en-US,"{'calories': '267 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '28 g', 'proteinContent': '8 g', 'fatContent': '13 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '2 g', 'cholesterolContent': '15 mg', 'sodiumContent': '432 mg', 'fiberContent': '1 g', 'sugarContent': '1 g', 'servingSize': '1 serving'}",4.2,,The Woks of Life,45,8 serving(s)
Shanghai Pan-Fried Pork Buns (上海生煎馒头),Judy,https://thewoksoflife.com/shanghai-pan-fried-pork-buns-shengjian-mantou/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/shengjian-mantou-28.jpg,"['1/2 pound pork skin', '1/2 pound pork and/or chicken bones ((preference for chicken bones) )', '3 cups water', '2 tablespoons Shaoxing wine', '3 slices ginger', '1 scallion', 'salt to taste', '1 pound ground pork ((70% lean 30% fat))', '1/4 cup Shaoxing wine', '3/4 teaspoon salt', '1 teaspoon sesame oil', '1 tablespoon sugar', '3 tablespoons water', '1/2 teaspoon dark soy sauce', '1 1/2 tablespoons light soy sauce', '1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper', '1 1/2 tablespoons ginger ((grated))', '1/4 cup scallions ((minced))', '1 1/2 cups aspic ((diced into ¼-inch pieces))', '2 cups cake flour ((can substitute 1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour and ¼ cup cornstarch sifted together))', '1 cup all purpose flour', '1/2 teaspoon salt', '1/2 teaspoon instant yeast', '3/4 cup water ((may need an additional tablespoon depending on the humidity))', '1/2 teaspoon neutral oil ((such as avocado oil or vegetable oil, for brushing))', 'neutral flavored cooking oil ((such as avocado, vegetable, or canola oil))', 'water', 'toasted sesame seeds ((black and white sesame seeds both work))', '1 scallion ((finely chopped))']","THE DAY BEFORE: Make the aspic
Add the pork skin and bones to a thick-bottomed medium pot with just enough water to cover them. Bring to a boil, and boil for 1 minute. Turn off the heat, and rinse the pork skin and bones under running water to clean them. Clean the pot as well.
Trim away all the fat under the pork skin and cut into very thin slices. This makes it easier for the collagen to release.
Fill the clean pot with 3 cups of water. Add the pork skin and bones, along with the Shaoxing wine, ginger, and scallion. Bring to a boil, and lower the heat to medium low. Simmer for 1 hour. (It should bubble gently at a low simmer).
After 1 hour, the pork skin should be very tender, and the stock should look thick and almost milky. Strain to remove all solids, and add salt to taste. Let the liquid solidify in a covered container in the refrigerator overnight.
This should yield 1½ cups of aspic, the perfect amount for this recipe.
THE DAY OF/NIGHT BEFORE: Make the filling
In a large bowl, combine the ground pork, Shaoxing wine, salt, sesame oil, sugar, water, dark soy sauce, light soy sauce, ground white-pepper, grated ginger, and minced scallions. Whip in one direction for 5 minutes until it has the texture of a thick paste.
Dice the aspic into ¼-inch cubes. Carefully stir it into the filling to evenly distribute. Transfer the bowl to the refrigerator. Chill for at least 1 hour, preferably 1 ½ - 2 hours while you make the dough.
1 ½ TO 2 HOURS BEFORE SERVING: Make the dough
In the bowl of an electric mixer, add the cake flour, all purpose flour, salt, and instant yeast. Attach the dough hook, and turn the mixer on to the lowest setting. Slowly stream in the water. Knead the dough for 10 minutes until smooth. The dough should be soft but hold its shape.
Shape the dough into a smooth ball, brush the top with oil, and cover the mixing bowl with a plate. Proof at room temperature for 30 minutes.
Assemble the buns:
These buns will go straight into the pan as you assemble them, so prepare the pan first by lightly oiling it with a neutral flavored cooking oil. A wide non-stick pan works best. A cast-iron pan also works, but can be more challenging when it comes to preventing the buns from sticking. You’ll need to pre-heat it until it’s just smoking, cover it with a thin layer of cooking oil, and let it cool completely. Now you’re ready to assemble your buns.
Once the dough finishes proofing, knead it for 3 minutes on the lowest setting of your stand mixer. (If kneading by hand, knead for 5 minutes.) Remove ⅓ of the dough, and keep the rest covered to prevent it from drying out.
When you’re ready to start rolling out the dough, take your filling out of the refrigerator. If it’s warm in your kitchen (especially in the summertime), rest the bowl of filling in an ice bath to keep it cold while you assemble the buns.
On a clean and lightly-floured surface, roll the dough into a long tube and cut it into small 20 gram pieces, measured with a kitchen scale. Keep in mind, this recipe makes about 30 buns, so your piece of dough (⅓ of the total) should divide into ten 20g pieces.
Take each piece, roll it into a round ball, and press to flatten. Roll it out using a rolling pin from edge to center, rotating the dough as you roll. You should have a 4-inch round wrapper where the edges are thinner than the center.
Add about 2 tablespoons of filling in the center, and pleat to close the top. Make sure you keep your fingers as clean as possible during this process. Wet or greasy fingers make it challenging to seal the buns.
As you make the buns, arrange them in your pre-oiled pan. Placing them pleated-side down is traditional, but only do this if you're confident that your buns are well shaped and sealed. If not, place them pleated side up! Each bun should have half an inch of surrounding clearance. (You'll see I put them a bit closer together in my pan, which made them more difficult to separate!)
Pan-fry the buns:
Once the pan is filled with your first batch of buns, immediately move it to the stove, and turn on the heat to medium. Add enough oil such that the buns are sitting in about ⅛-inch of oil.
As the oil heats up, move the pan around so the edges of the pan are also heated. The oil should start bubbling lightly all around the pan as the buns slowly begin to shallow-fry. DO NOT be tempted to turn up the heat. We don’t want to burn the bottoms. Also, at this point, DO NOT touch the buns with any kitchen tool WHATSOEVER. They can be easily damaged, as they are not yet set.
After about 8-10 minutes, the oil should be bubbling evenly. The bottom edges of the buns should be beginning to brown lightly, and the buns will expand a little as they cook.
At this stage, add enough water so it comes up about ½ an inch (1.25 cm) in the pan. The water should come up about a third of buns’ height. Immediately cover the pan with a tight-fitting lid, and cook for another 8-10 minutes on medium-low heat.
Next, uncover the pan. The water should be mostly gone. Sprinkle the sesame seeds and chopped scallions over the top, put the lid back on, and cook for another 5 minutes over medium-low heat. (If there’s still a significant amount of water left in the pan at this point, you can turn up the heat slightly, but do take care not to burn the buns.)
The buns are done once you’ve cooked off all the water and the bottoms are golden brown. Use a dull kitchen tool to remove the buns, and avoid puncturing them. A stiff rubber spatula works well.

How to Cut Whole Pork Shoulder,Bill,https://thewoksoflife.com/how-to-cut-pork-shoulder/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/how-to-break-down-pork-shoulder-14.jpg,['1 whole pork picnic shoulder'],"Preparation:
In your kitchen sink, carefully remove the pork shoulder from the packaging. There is almost always excess liquid to drain off. Gently rinse the pork shoulder (avoid splashing water around, and be sure to disinfect the area afterwards). Pat dry with a paper towel and transfer the pork shoulder to a large cutting board.
De-boning:
Position the pork shoulder with the large skin side down and the broad side facing away from you. You can see the inside bone poking through both ends.
Find the seam/muscle membrane that runs from one end of the bone to the other and use your fingers to separate and pull the meat apart. Carefully make small cuts in the seam until the membrane pulls apart.
Continue to cut along the bone from the broad end of the pork shoulder over to the tapered end to fully expose it. Note that the bone is not straight, but bent at an angle. Gently pull the meat apart, and cut around and down the lengths of bone. Pulling the meat creates tension, which makes cutting through the membrane around the bone easier. Take your time with it!
Soon, you’ll see that you’ve sort of “flattened” the pork shoulder, and the bone will be clearly exposed. Continue to cut around the bone until you can get your fingers under it. Next, lift the bone and slide your knife tip under it. Cut under and around the bone to separate it from the meat.
Now grip the detached end of the bone and continue to cut the meat around the bone until the bone is completely separated from the meat. Lifting the bone up and letting the neat hang down creates tension between the meat and bone that makes cutting the meat away from the bone easier.
Breakdown:
Find other muscle membranes, and cut between the membrane/seams to separate the pieces of meat. You’ll find that the thickest pork chunk on the broad end of the roast works well for stir fries, since it is quite lean. Cut along the seam of this large chunk until you get to the skin, and continue to cut and separate the meat from the skin until the large pork chunk is detached. (Before stir-frying, trim off the muscle membrane and fat to ensure you get tender slices.)
Continue to find and cut along membranes and seams until you have separated most of the pork chunks from the middle, and near the narrow part of the pork on the leg. The medium pieces can be cut into chunks for stewing, used to make ground pork, or even butterflied for char siu.
Now you should have skin and fat on one side and a thinner cut of fat and meat that resembles pork belly on the other side. Cut off the portion that has only skin and fat and reserve.
Now you’ll be left with what resembles pork belly––a long piece with layers of fat, meat and skin––along with some remaining chunks of pork. Remove the pork belly piece, and continue cutting along the seams to separate the remaining pork chunks.",en-US,{},5.0,,The Woks of Life,20,None
Shanghai Savory Mooncakes (Xian Rou Yue Bing),Judy,https://thewoksoflife.com/savory-mooncakes/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/savory-mooncakes-11-1.jpg,"['1 pound ground pork ((450g))', '1/4 cup sugar ((50g))', '2 tablespoons honey', '2 tablespoons Shaoxing wine', '1 teaspoon salt', '1 tablespoon light soy sauce', '1 teaspoon ginger powder', '1/2 teaspoon garlic powder', '1 scallion ((VERY finely chopped))', '2¼ cups all-purpose flour ((290g))', '2½ tablespoons sugar', '1/3 cup lard ((or vegetable shortening))', '1/2 cup water ((120 ml))', '1½ cups all-purpose flour ((195g))', '1/2 cup lard ((or vegetable shortening))', '1 egg ((for egg wash))', '¼ cup toasted sesame seeds']","For the meat filling, mix and combine all the ingredients well. There’s no need to stir too much or whip the mixture in any way, or the filling will turn rubbery. Cover and set aside in the fridge.
For the soft dough, add the flour, sugar, and lard to a mixing bowl, and mix until thoroughly combined. Then slowly add the water in 3-4 batches and knead the dough to form a smooth dough ball. Set it aside and cover with a damp cloth. Make sure the dough is not too dry. To test for quality, form a dough ball and press it flat. The edges should not crack.
For the pastry dough, combine the flour and lard and knead to form a dough ball. Cover with clear plastic wrap and let it sit in fridge for 20 minutes.
To assemble the mooncakes, divide both the soft dough and the pastry dough into 24 pieces each. You should have 48 bits of dough in total. Take the time to divide them equally and roll each into balls. We used a scale to help us out. Cover all the dough pieces with a damp paper towel to prevent them from drying out as you work.
Take one piece of soft dough and press into a small round disc. Put a piece of the pastry dough in the center of the soft dough, close to seal, and use your palms to flatten.
Then roll it out into a long oval shape. Roll that into a more uniform cigar shape. Roll the cigar out lengthwise into a longer rope, and then roll it into a tight, short bundle.
Stand the bundle up and press it flat. With a rolling pin, roll the dough bundle out into a 3½-inch disc (it should be slightly thinner around the outer edges and thicker in the middle).
Add about one tablespoon (about 20 grams) of meat filling to the center of the disc, and seal tightly. Be careful with the filling—you can’t overstuff these or they will burst open during the baking process.
Now lightly press the dough to shape it into a flat moon cake shape. Place it on a baking sheet seam side down. Now, repeat with the remaining pieces of dough and filling until you’ve used everything up. You will need two baking sheets for a total of 24 moon cakes. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees, and position the baking rack in the middle of the oven.
Brush each cake with egg wash and sprinkle the top with sesame seeds. Once the oven is preheated, bake each pan of moon cakes for 25 minutes until the cakes start to turn golden brown.",en-US,"{'calories': '154 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '20 g', 'proteinContent': '6 g', 'fatContent': '5 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '2 g', 'cholesterolContent': '20 mg', 'sodiumContent': '153 mg', 'fiberContent': '1 g', 'sugarContent': '5 g', 'servingSize': '1 serving'}",4.86,,The Woks of Life,145,24 serving(s)

Chinese Rib Tips: Fall Apart Tender Takeout-Style,Bill,https://thewoksoflife.com/rib-tips-chinese-takeout-bbq/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/chinese-rib-tips-2.jpg,"['3 pounds pork rib tips ((1.4 kg))', '3 tablespoons maltose ((mixed in 1 tablespoon of hot water; can substitute honey))', '5 cloves garlic ((minced))', '¼ cup hoisin sauce', '4 ½ teaspoons salt', '¼ cup sugar', '1 tablespoon five spice powder', '3 tablespoons Shaoxing wine', '2 tablespoons ketchup', '¼ teaspoon red food coloring ((optional, but if you really want to go for that “authentic” look…))']","Rinse the pork rib tips, and pat dry with paper towels.
In a large mixing bowl, combine the maltose with the hot water using a spatula. Maltose is VERY thick and sticky, so the hot water helps to loosen and liquefy it so it’s easier to work with and can serve as the base of your marinade. You may mistake the stuff for super glue. You can use your hands to soften it faster, but a spatula works fine too. Microwaving the maltose for 10 seconds softens it up also. Working with maltose is admittedly a bit difficult, but the rich stickiness really makes it worth the extra steps! If you can’t find maltose, we’d love to hear your kitchen experiments with honey or agave as substitutes in the comments!
Add the garlic, hoisin sauce, salt, sugar, five spice powder, Shaoxing wine, ketchup, and red food coloring, if using.
Next, add the rib tip pieces to the bowl, rubbing the BBQ sauce into the meat and ensuring that it’s completely coated. You can cut the rib tips into smaller pieces but I leave them whole to ensure they’ll be tender and juicy. Cover the bowl with a large plate or plastic wrap and let the rib tips marinate overnight in the refrigerator (12 to 24 hours).
After the ribs are marinated, remove them from the refrigerator for 1 to 2 hours, letting them come up to room temperature. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Line a sheet pan or roasting pan with parchment paper or non-stick foil to prevent the ribs from sticking to the pan. Place the two slabs of rib tips on the pan, cover with foil, and place them in the oven. Save the marinating liquid for basting.
Bake the ribs for 30 minutes, baste them, turn them over, and baste again. Cover again with the foil. Return them to the oven and reduce the temperature to 275 degrees F.
Repeat the process two times––that’s 60 minutes of additional cooking time. After 90 minutes in the oven, baste again, and return to the oven uncovered.
Baste the ribs every 20 minutes for another hour until done. At this point, if you like a slightly crispy bark on the rib tips, increase the oven temperature back to 325 degrees F. Add 2 tablespoons of water to the pan around the perimeter of the rib tips if it starts to dry out and burn.

Place the pork belly in a medium pot, and fill it with just enough water to cover it. Bring the water to a boil. Once the pork has gone opaque and appears cooked on the outside, shut off the heat, remove the pork from the pot, and rinse it clean under running water. Dump out the water and clean the pot.
Put the pork belly back in the clean pot, and add 3 cups of water, the Shaoxing wine, rock sugar, light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, scallions, ginger, star anise, cinnamon, black cardamom, galangal, Sichuan peppercorns, and bay leaves. Bring everything to a boil, then immediately turn down the heat to low and simmer for 90 minutes to 2 hours, until fork tender. To test it, stick a fork into the meat. It’s done if you can pull the fork out easily. Do not use high heat when simmering to avoid drying out the sauce. Add salt to taste.
While the pork is simmering, make the buns. To a mixing bowl, add the flour, yeast, and salt. Slowly add the warm water, mixing and kneading until it forms a smooth dough ball. Once a dough ball is formed, knead it for another 10 minutes to build up the gluten in the dough--this will make the buns chewier. You can also use an electric mixer with the dough hook attachment for this. The dough should feel soft and easy to work with. Cover the dough, and let it proof at room temperature for about an hour until it doubles in size.
After proofing, knead the dough for about 5 minutes to get rid of any air bubbles. Divide the dough into 12 equal pieces. Cover the dough balls with a kitchen towel to prevent them from drying out while you’re shaping the buns.
To shape the buns, take each dough ball and roll it out into a cigar-like shape. Next, roll it out into a longer and narrower strip, and fold it in half lengthwise. Roll it up into a bundle, with the loose end tucked underneath. Turn it on its side so the swirls are facing up, and press it down with your palm. Now roll it out into a disc about 4 inches in diameter. Repeat these steps for all of the dough balls. Cover the shaped buns with a dry kitchen towel, and let rest for 20 minutes before cooking.
Pre-heat a flat-bottomed pan or cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Place the buns in the pan about an inch apart (no oil is necessary). Cover the lid, and let the buns cook for 2 minutes on each side. The heat shouldn’t be too high, or your buns may burn. After cooking the buns for 2 minutes on each side, remove the lid, and cook each side for another minute or so until the entire bun is golden brown.
To serve, take out the pork, coarsely chop it, and transfer it to a bowl. Mix in the chopped cilantro, and add the sauce from the meat to your desired consistency.

Use the dough hook attachment, and turn on the mixer to “stir.” Let it go for 15 minutes, occasionally stopping the mixer to push the dough together. If you're in a humid climate and the dough is too sticky, feel free to add a little more flour ¼ cup at a time until it comes together. If you don't have a mixer and would like to knead by hand, extend the kneading time by 5-10 minutes.
After 15 minutes of mixing, the dough is ready for proofing. Cover the bowl with a damp towel and place in a warm spot for 1 hour. The dough will grow to 1.5X its original size.
Meanwhile, prepare your filling and topping. To make the filling, heat 2 tablespoons oil in a wok over medium high heat. Add the onion and stir-fry for 2 minutes. Add the sugar, soy sauce, oyster sauce, sesame oil, and dark soy. Stir and cook until it starts to bubble up. Add the water and flour. Reduce the heat to medium low and cook, stirring, for a couple minutes until thickened. Remove from the heat and stir in the roast pork. Set aside to cool.
To prepare the topping, add the dry milk powder to a mixing bowl. If your dry milk powder has some larger clumps, crush them up with your fingers so it’s uniformly powdery. Add the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and superfine sugar. Stir to combine. Add the shortening, milk, egg yolk, and vanilla. Use your hands to mix everything together into a dough. If it’s too dry, add a little more milk a teaspoon at a time until it comes together. Cover with an overturned bowl or plate, and set aside at room temperature.
After the hour of proofing, put the dough back in the mixer and stir for another 5 minutes to get rid of air bubbles. You can also knead by hand. Dump the dough onto a lightly floured surface, and cut it into 18 equal pieces.
To assemble, divide the topping mixture into 18 equal pieces and roll each into a ball. Roll each ball out into a flat circle using a rolling pin.
Take a piece of bread dough, and flatten with your hands into a rough circle. Put a heaping tablespoon of pork filling in the middle, and wrap the dough around it. Roll into a smooth ball between your hands, and place on a parchment-lined baking sheet, seam-side down. Top the bun with a circle of topping.
Continue assembling until all the buns are made. Cover with a clean, damp towel and allow to rise for another hour.
After they’re done rising, position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Brush the topping with egg yolk and any exposed dough with egg white. Bake for 18-20 minutes until golden. If you notice the topping getting too dark, tent the buns lightly with foil.

Using your hands, work the mixture into the pork ribs until they are well coated. Marinate anywhere from 2 hours to overnight.
If you refrigerate the pork ribs overnight, let them come up to room temperature before cooking. When you’re ready to fry, pour 3 or more cups of peanut or vegetable oil into a small to medium pot—enough so you have 2-3 inches of oil. Heat your frying oil to 300 degrees F/150 degrees C. It’s best to use a kitchen thermometer to monitor the oil temperature before and during the frying process.
When the marinated ribs are at room temperature and while your oil is heating, toss the ribs once more to redistribute the marinade, as there may be liquid that has pooled. Make sure everything is well-combined. Next, add the cornstarch to the ribs and mix until a paste forms that evenly coats the ribs.
When the oil reaches frying temperature—either via your thermometer, or when a rib dipped in the oil sizzles strongly—deep fry the pork ribs in small batches, about 4-6 pieces at a time. Use a slotted spoon to separate them as soon as you place them in the oil to avoid sticking and ensure even cooking.
Turn up the heat once you drop in the ribs, as the oil will cool. As you fry, continue to adjust the heat lower or higher as needed to maintain temperature. The pork ribs should fry fairly quickly, about 5-7 minutes.

Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a wok or Dutch oven over medium high heat. Add the smashed ginger and sear the ribs for 1 minute on each side until browned.
Turn the heat down to medium and add the shallots and garlic. Stir-fry for another minute and add the Shaoxing wine, ground bean sauce, hoisin sauce, soy sauce, salt, five spice powder, white pepper, and sesame oil. Stir-fry the ribs for another minute.
Add the chicken stock, bring to a boil, and adjust the heat to a slow simmer. Cover and cook for 45 minutes, checking and stirring the mixture every 10 minutes. The ribs should be submerged in the liquid at the beginning and the sauce should reduce slightly but the braised pork ribs should still look a little soupy at the end of the 45 minutes so add more water or chicken stock if needed.
While the ribs are cooking, heat ½ cup vegetable oil to 300 degrees F in a wok or cast iron pan and add the taro, spreading the pieces out so there is a single layer. Fry on each side until they just start to turn brown and have a slight crust on them, about a minute on each side. Drain the excess oil and toss the taro with a large pinch of salt. This process give the taro a light crust and prevents it from becoming mushy after cooking with the ribs.
Once the ribs have been simmering for 45 minutes, they should be tender. There should be quite a bit of standing liquid remaining. Add the taro, and gently fold the mixture together to coat the taro pieces with liquid. Let cook for another 15 minutes, giving everything a gentle stir every 2-3 minutes. If the liquid dries up completely, add another cup of water or chicken stock (the taro will absorb it).

Toss the ribs with the Shaoxing wine, 1 teaspoon sugar, 3/4 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper and one egg white. Marinate for 1 hour.
While the pork is marinating, prepare a small pot with oil and have it ready to fry the ribs. The oil should be at least 1.5” deep, so the ribs can be submerged under the oil when frying. Using a smaller pot requires less oil, and you’ll have to fry the ribs in a few batches.
Once the ribs are marinated, sprinkle the cornstarch over the ribs to evenly coat them. I used a ziplock bag to toss the ribs with the cornstarch and get an even coating.
Heat the oil over medium heat. It's ready when you stick a chopstick in it and small bubbles form around the tip of the chopstick. Slowly lower the ribs into the oil, making sure to leave some space between each rib so that they fry evenly. After 6 to 7 minutes, when the ribs start to turn lightly brown, turn up the heat to high for about a minute or two, so the ribs can really take on that nice golden color.

Next add the dried squid/conch/dried scallops (if using), cover the pot loosely, and turn the heat down to a simmer. Let the soup simmer for 4 hours.
Taste the soup and re-season with salt if needed. Add the soaked rice and simmer for another hour. If you decide to use Judy’s method for 20-minute Congee, then all you need is an additional 30 minutes after adding the grains!
One point I’d like to make here is that the texture and consistency of congee is a very personal thing. Some like their congee cooked like a gruel, where you can’t see any signs of individual rice granules at all. Others prefer the rice granules cooked until they just open up or “blossom like a flower,” to use the literal translation of a Chinese expression. Finally, some prefer it thick and others prefer it thin. This recipe yields a thick congee, where the rice is cooked until it blossoms like a flower. But once you’re familiar with this congee recipe, feel free to adjust the amount of water and/or rice according to your own preferences!
At this point, give your congee another taste, and add additional salt to taste. Ladle the congee into small bowls, and serve with chopped scallion, cilantro, and pepper.",en-US,"{'calories': '58 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '12 g', 'proteinContent': '1 g', 'fatContent': '1 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '1 g', 'cholesterolContent': '1 mg', 'sodiumContent': '610 mg', 'fiberContent': '1 g', 'sugarContent': '1 g', 'servingSize': '1 serving'}",5.0,,The Woks of Life,310,12 serving(s)

(You can do this the night before.)
Now, soak the glutinous rice in a bowl covered with at least an inch of water above the rice for about 2 hours. While the rice is soaking, prepare the meat filling.
Weigh about 13 ounces of lean pork and 3 ounces of pork fat. You can use the techniques from our post on How to Grind Meat without a Meat Grinder in Minutes, and hand-chop the pork very finely. It’s also fine to use store-bought ground pork, but make sure it’s 80% lean. In a large bowl, add the ground pork, water chestnuts, ginger, the scallions, water, Shaoxing wine, cornstarch, white pepper, sesame oil, sea salt, and sugar.
Stir to combine everything well, whipping in just *one* direction for at least 5 minutes until the filling becomes fluffy and sticky. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. While the meat is marinating, prepare the steamer. Wash and trim the bamboo leaves, and use them to line the steamer.
After 2 hours of soaking, drain the glutinous rice, and do your best to shake off any excess water.
Remove the meat filling from the fridge after the 30 minutes has elapsed. Now it’s time to make the pearls! Take about a tablespoon of meat filling, form a ball and roll it in the glutinous rice so that the whole surface is coated. Roll it between your palms lightly to ensure all the glutinous rice adheres to the meatball. Position the meatballs on the bamboo leaf with about ½ an inch of space in between each meatball.
To cook, start with cold water with the steamer covered. Steam over high heat for 20 minutes. After steaming, turn off the heat, and let the meatballs sit with the cover on for 3 additional minutes before removing the lid and serving.",en-US,"{'calories': '188 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '13 g', 'proteinContent': '9 g', 'fatContent': '10 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '4 g', 'cholesterolContent': '33 mg', 'sodiumContent': '260 mg', 'fiberContent': '1 g', 'sugarContent': '1 g', 'servingSize': '1 serving'}",4.8,,The Woks of Life,505,10 serving(s)
Crispy Stuffed Lotus Root with Pork,Judy,https://thewoksoflife.com/stuffed-lotus-root-pork/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/lotus-root-recipe-3.jpg,"['1½ pounds fresh lotus roots ((680g))', 'Oil ((for frying))', '¾ pound ground pork ((340g; can substitute ground chicken))', '1 tablespoon Shaoxing wine', '2 tablespoons light soy sauce', '1/4 cup water ((60 ml))', '2 teaspoons sesame oil', '1 teaspoon cornstarch', '¼ teaspoon white pepper', '1 scallion ((very finely chopped))', '2 slices ginger ((finely minced))', '¼ cup all-purpose flour ((30g))', '¼ cup sweet rice flour ((30g; can substitute cornstarch))', '½ teaspoon salt', '¼ teaspoon five-spice powder', '1/3 cup water ((80 ml))', '¼ cup beer ((of your choice))']","Step 1: Make the meat filling
Put all of the meat filling ingredients in a mixing bowl. Stir in one direction for about 5-10 minutes until the meat mixture becomes a very sticky paste. Set it aside.
Step 2: Assembly
Peel, wash, and cut the lotus roots into 1/8-inch slices. Rinse the lotus root slices in cold water to wash away excess starch and so they don’t turn black (again, they're similar to potatoes). Drain. It’s best to spin them in a salad spinner to get rid of all the excess water.
Take one slice, and spread on a thin layer of meat filling. Top it with another slice of lotus root to create a sandwich. Gently press the two slices together so the meat filling fills the holes of the lotus root on both sides This step will “lock” the two slices together. Repeat until you've used all of the slices. You should be able to make about 15-18 pieces.
Step 3: Make the batter
Add both flours, salt and the five-spice powder to a mixing bowl. Slowly add the water, stirring constantly. Stir thoroughly until any lumps have dissolved. Then stir in the beer. This batter is pretty light. You can thicken it by adding a bit more flour if you like a heavier batter. Also, stir the batter between dipping each lotus root piece, as sweet rice flour tends to settle quickly.
(Don’t coat the lotus roots until right before frying. If too much liquid gets in between the meat and the lotus roots by coating too early, they will fall apart in your pot of oil.) Speaking of which...
Step 4: Frying
Now it’s time to prepare the oil for frying. I like to use a small, deep pot because it requires less oil and its depth helps contain the oil, avoiding splatters and burns.
Fill the pot about 1.5” deep with oil, and heat it to 275 degrees. Once the oil reaches 275 degrees, coat the lotus in the batter and slowly lower into the oil. Fry a few pieces at a time, frying each side for about 6 – 7 minutes. Take them out and set them aside on a plate lined with a paper towel. Repeat until all the lotus sandwiches are fried. Now turn up the heat to bring the oil up to 325 degrees. Re-fry each piece for 3 minutes to really get the color and crunchiness that we are looking for.",en-US,"{'calories': '385 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '30 g', 'proteinContent': '14 g', 'fatContent': '23 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '5 g', 'cholesterolContent': '41 mg', 'sodiumContent': '608 mg', 'fiberContent': '6 g', 'sugarContent': '1 g', 'servingSize': '1 serving'}",5.0,,The Woks of Life,90,6 serving(s)

Slice the pork about 2 inches thick on a 30-degree angle. Then pound the meat to about ½-inch thick using a rolling pin or the back of your knife. Be careful not to pound it too thin.
Marinate the pork chops with 2 beaten eggs, ½ teaspoon white pepper powder, 2 tablespoons light soy sauce, 1 tablespoon Shaoxing wine, 1½ tablespoons oyster sauce, and 1 teaspoon cornstarch. Mix everything well, and marinate for 30 minutes. (Move it to the refrigerator if you’re making this in the summer months.)
Now prepare the dipping sauce. Add 1½ tablespoons light soy sauce, 1 tablespoon black vinegar, ½ teaspoon sugar, 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce, 3 tablespoons water, and chili oil to taste. Stir and set aside.
Add the vegetable oil to a deep pan for frying, at a depth of about 1 inch. Preheat it using low heat. While that’s happening, quickly beat 2 eggs in a large bowl. In another bowl, add ½ cup all-purpose flour, and add 1½ cups panko to another large plate.
Take the pork chop, lightly coat it with flour, then quickly dip it in the beaten egg. Next, dredge it in the panko to coat. Do your best to press the panko flakes into the pork chop to achieve a thick coating. Repeat until all of the pork is coated.
Now turn the heat to medium high, and make sure the oil comes up to 350 degrees F. Fry the pork chops in batches for about 1½ minutes on each side. They’re done once the crust turns golden brown. Don’t over-fry the pork chops. Most people overcook their pork. They should be juicy! In between batches, transfer the pork to a wire rack or plate lined with paper towels.

Add 1 tablespoon of Shaoxing wine to each bowl, and pour enough boiling water over the top to submerge the seafood. Soak the shrimp for one hour. Soak the scallops for at least 2 hours (up to 6 hours).
While that’s happening, prepare your shallots and garlic. I highly recommend using a food processor for this. Thinly slice the shallots first by hand, and then pulse into a fine dice. Pulse the whole garlic cloves until minced. Prepare the chili peppers and set aside as well.
When the soaking times have elapsed, drain the seafood. Heat your steamer over high heat, and steam the scallops and the ham in heatproof bowls for 15 minutes. Reserve any liquid that dripped into the bowl with the scallops.
When the 15 minutes have elapsed, remove both from the steamer and let cool. Shred the scallops into threads by breaking them up between your fingers. Using a food processor, pulse the scallops about 6-7 times, in 3 batches, until they resemble short, fine threads. Next, pulse the shrimp about 7-8 times, or until they resemble coarse crumbs. Mince the ham by hand--best to avoid your expensive jinhua ham from resembling cat food!
Collect the water from steaming the scallops (whatever dripped off into the bowl that the scallops were in while you were steaming––the amount will vary each time you do it, and that’s fine), and mix with 1¾ cups chicken stock and 2 tablespoons brown sugar. Set aside.
In a large wok, heat your 7 cups of oil to 225 degrees F--it’s hot enough when a chopstick dipped in the oil bubbles slightly. The oil temperature for the duration of the cooking process can vacillate between 200 and 250 degrees F, or on your stovetop, between medium-high and high heat, depending on what you are adding to the oil and how much. If your wok is too small for safe frying, use any other large, deep pot. A dutch oven would also work well.
Add all of the scallops and let fry for 5 minutes. Next, add the shrimp. Fry the mixture for 15 minutes. Next, add the ham and cook for an additional 3 minutes. Add the chopped chili peppers and cook for an additional 3 minutes.
Turn off the heat. Using a fine-meshed strainer, transfer the seafood mixture to another large skillet or wok, letting the oil drain off.
Turn the heat on again and let the oil come back up to 225F. Add the shallots. Let fry for 10 minutes. They should become slightly golden but not crispy.
While that’s happening, heat your second wok over medium-high heat. Add the last 6 tablespoons of Shaoxing wine, the 2 tablespoons of dark mushroom soy sauce, and the sugar/chicken stock mixture you prepared earlier. Stir to combine, and simmer to let the liquid cook off.
Next, add the garlic to the shallots and cook for 10 minutes, keeping an eye on your second wok. The garlic should get golden and slightly crisped.
When the liquid has cooked off in your seafood mixture and the shallot/garlic mixture is the correct color, carefully pour the seafood mixture back into the main wok. Lower the heat to medium and stir to combine. Add the fish sauce and chili flakes, stirring to combine.
Transfer to clean, sterile containers, and let cool on the counters before refrigerating. You can eat the XO sauce right away or you can let the flavors meld for 2 to 3 days before digging in!

Use your hands to combine everything together well. Cover and marinate for about 1 hour in the refrigerator.
While the pork is marinating, prepare the rice mixture. In a clean, dry wok over medium-low heat, add the long grain rice, sweet rice, Sichuan peppercorns, and the star anise. Cook it for about 5 minutes until the rice turns a light brown color. After 5 minutes, turn off the heat, and let the mixture cool slightly. Next, use a food processor or mortar and pestle to mill the mixture into a coarse grind. When using the food processor, pulse the mixture a couple of times. The rice shouldn’t be too finely ground.
It’s also a great idea to double or triple the rice mixture, and store the leftovers in the refrigerator, so it’s readily available if and when you want to make this dish again. The rice mixture should last a few months in the fridge.
Next, we’ll assemble and cook the dish. Peel the taro skin, rinse, and cut it into pieces roughly the same size as the pork belly pieces. Add the taro to the marinated pork.

BBQ Char Siu Roast Pork on the Grill,Bill,https://thewoksoflife.com/bbq-char-siu-grill/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/grilled-char-siu-6-1.jpg,"['2 pounds boneless pork shoulder ((900g, select a cut with some good fat on it))', '2 tablespoons sugar', '2 teaspoons salt', '½ teaspoon five spice powder', '¼ teaspoon white pepper', '1 tablespoon Shaoxing wine', '½ teaspoon sesame oil', '1 tablespoon hoisin sauce', '2 teaspoons molasses', '3 cloves minced garlic', '1/8 teaspoon red food coloring', '1 tablespoon oil', '1 tablespoon honey', '1 tablespoon hoisin sauce', '1 tablespoon warm water', 'Leftover marinade']","Cut the pork into long 1 1/2 to 2-inch thick pieces. There is a technique to cutting pork that I learned from my father. First, find where the meat has the fat and the membrane between the muscle, and use a sharp knife to cut and separate them. My father always said that if you look at the pork closely, it will show you how it wants to be cut by following the muscle membrane lines. This is a brilliant way to do it, because you end up with the fat and the tougher membrane on the outside, protecting the tender meat and keeping it juicy on the grill. The marinade and heat also break down this membrane, so it won’t be tough at all.
Once you have your pieces of meat separated, you can decide if they need to be cut further into manageable pieces since grilling involves more handling and moving/turning of the meat than roasting in the oven. You will most likely have to butterfly the thicker pieces of the meat to get the desired thickness. Always start where the meat starts to be thicker; cut towards and into the thickest part, stop 1½ inches from the end and butterfly the meat. This method for breaking down the pork also applies to roasting Chinese BBQ pork in the oven. I included some pictures and details since we got quite a few questions after posting the oven-roasted version.
Mix all of the marinade ingredients in a bowl and mix well. Place the pork into a gallon zip top bag, and pour the marinade mix in. Seal the bag and work the marinade into the meat until every piece is evenly coated. Refrigerate overnight.
The next day, place the pork on a plate, making sure to shake off the excess marinade in the bag. Too much marinade left on the meat will increase the chances of burning your pork. Pour the rest of the marinade into a bowl and add the rest of the basting ingredients; get your basting brush ready.
Preheat your grill, making sure it's extremely hot. You want a nice sear on the meat to seal in the juices before you turn it, but try not to get it too crispy on one side. You will be turning the meat often during the cooking process to prevent burning and make sure that marinade gets nice and caramelized. On a hot grill, you should be cooking it for about 3 minutes before flipping it.
After both sides are seared, you can turn the grill down slightly to prevent drying out the meat. Turn the meat often; I did every 2 to 3 minutes making sure to get an even sear on all sides. I also started to brush and baste the meat after each turn to keep it moist and flavorful. If the meat looks like it starts to get dry on the surface, it needs to be basted.
Continue this turning and basting for another 20 to 30 minutes and make sure you don’t walk away from the grill! With all of this marinade, the roast pork could burn to a crisp very quickly, so protect your time and investment! Also make sure that you stop basting a few minutes before you pull the meat off the grill since the marinade was in contact with raw meat.
You can check the pork with a meat thermometer to be sure it’s done (145 degrees F), and remove it from the grill to let it rest for 5 minutes before slicing.

Traditionally, sweet potato starch is used; you can also use that, or cornstarch))', 'vegetable oil ((for frying))', '1 tablespoon vegetable oil', '1 dried red chili', '1 clove garlic ((chopped))', '1/8 teaspoon sugar', '2-2.5 cups pickled mustard greens ((chopped))', '1 small head napa cabbage ((washed and roughly chopped); can substitute any other leafy green))', '2 tablespoons vegetable oil', '1 slice ginger ((optional))', '3 cloves garlic ((sliced))', 'salt ((to taste))', '4-6 tea eggs', '6 cups cooked white rice']","First prepare the pork chops. Rinse them under cold running water to remove any bone fragments and other impurities (be sure to disinfect the sink after you’re done). To avoid curling during frying, make 1-inch cuts around the perimeter of the pork chop, about 1-2 inches apart. After that, use a rolling pin to hammer the chops to a ½-inch thickness. It can help to put some parchment paper on top of the chops to prevent splatter.
Add them to a large bowl, and add the grated garlic, 3 tablespoons water, salt, sugar, white pepper, five spice powder, light soy sauce, wine, and 1 teaspoon potato starch. Mix thoroughly to coat the pork chops. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours or overnight.
While your pork chops are marinating, you’ll want to prepare some other items. First, the tea eggs—if you’re only letting your pork chops marinate for 3 hours, you’ll need to make the tea eggs the night before (you could also make plain hard-boiled eggs if pressed for time). You can also wash and chop the napa cabbage, and prepare your mustard green ingredients. You’ll also need to make rice!
When you’re ready to fry the pork chops, add the additional ½ cup water and ½ cup potato starch to the pork chops, and toss them until they’re evenly coated in the resulting paste. In a cast iron skillet or Dutch oven, add about ¾ inch oil, and heat over medium high heat. When some of the marinade dipped into the hot oil sizzles vigorously, you’re ready to fry.
Fry the pork chops one at a time, carefully lowering them into the hot oil so they lay completely flat. Fry for about 3 minutes on each side, lowering the heat to medium if needed (i.e. if the pork chops are getting too dark). Repeat with all four pork chops.
When you’re on the third or fourth pork chop, if you are able, we recommend getting some kitchen help and sauteeing the mustard greens. Add 1 tablespoon oil to a hot wok until just smoking. Break the dried chili pepper in half and add it to the oil with the garlic. After 20 seconds, add the mustard greens and sugar. Stir until heated through (they should not take on any color). This quick process should take about 4-5 minutes.
You’ll also need to stir-fry your choice of greens. Add another couple tablespoons oil to your wok, and heat until it’s just smoking. Add the ginger and garlic, let sizzle for 10-20 seconds, and follow with the cabbage. Cook until the cabbage is wilted, and season with salt to taste.
On each plate, serve rice, a pile of cabbage, a healthy few spoonfuls of the mustard greens, a halved tea egg, and of course a pork chop!",en-US,"{'calories': '388 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '19 g', 'proteinContent': '30 g', 'fatContent': '20 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '10 g', 'cholesterolContent': '98 mg', 'sodiumContent': '830 mg', 'fiberContent': '1 g', 'sugarContent': '3 g', 'servingSize': '1 serving'}",4.91,,The Woks of Life,255,6 serving(s)

You want the pork to look a little bit like a paste.
To make the wontons, take a wrapper, and add about a teaspoon of filling. Use your finger to coat the edges with water or egg wash (this helps the two sides seal together).
Fold the wonton in half so you have a rectangle shape. Bring together the two outer corners so they overlap slightly, add another drop of water or egg wash, and press to seal.
Keep assembling until all the filling is gone, which should make you about 18 wontons. Like all wonton recipes, you can double or triple the batch, eat some, then freeze the rest for another day. Place the wontons on a baking sheet or plate lined with parchment paper to prevent sticking.
Boil a pot of water for the wontons. While the water is coming to a boil, make the sauce by mixing all of the ingredients together in a small mixing bowl. If you like spicy, add more of the chili peppers and not just the oil from your homemade chili oil. This recipe makes enough for 18 or 20 wontons.
Give the boiling water a good stir and drop the wontons in, being careful not to crowd them. Continue stirring so they do not stick. Adjust the heat to achieve a low boil, and cook the wontons for about 2 minutes or until the wrappers begin to look translucent. I like mine a little bit al dente, so I take them out right at 2 minutes when they float to the top.
Use a slotted spoon to drain the water and transfer the wontons to a serving bowl. Stir in 1/4 cup of the boiling water into your sauce, then pour the sauce over the wontons.

Fry the peanuts in the oil on low heat for 2 minutes, until just starting to turn golden brown. More oil will be fried out of the peanuts, and the mixture will become fragrant.
Add the chili bean sauce to the peanuts and oil, and stir for 30 seconds to bring out the color of the red peppers in the sauce and infuse the oil, which is what you are looking for in this dish.
Next, add the onions and stir fry for 2 minutes on medium low heat until the onion begins to turn translucent.
Add the carrots, five spice tofu, and sugar, and stir fry for another 3 minutes on medium heat. Next, add 1 cup of chicken stock and the blanched pork and continue to stir fry until the liquid has evaporated (about 5 minutes). Add another cup of stock and repeat the stir-frying again until the liquid has evaporated. This continuous stir-fry melds all the flavors together.
Add the remaining 4 cups of stock, and bring it to a boil. Turn the heat down to medium low and simmer for another 30 minutes. Check the mixture every 5 minutes while simmering and give it a stir so the sauce on the side of the wok does not burn. The final sauce should have a cup of liquid and lots of oil.
Boil the noodles according to package directions until al dente. Chewy noodles are always the best for soup!
Divide the noodles and sauce among four bowls. Season with a little bit of salt if needed, and then pour over the water that you used to cook the noodles to create the soup.

Bring a large pot of water to a boil and blanch the vegetables just until wilted, about 60-90 seconds. Drain and rinse in cold water.
Grab a good clump of veg and carefully squeeze out as much water as you can. Very finely chop the vegetables (you can also speed up the process by throwing them in the food processor). Repeat until all the vegetables are chopped.
In a medium bowl, add the finely chopped vegetables, ground pork, 2 1/2 tablespoons sesame oil, pinch of white pepper, 1 tablespoon soy sauce, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1-2 tablespoons Shaoxing wine. Mix very thoroughly until the mixture is totally emulsified—almost like a paste.
Now it’s time to assemble! Fill a small bowl with water. Grab a wrapper and use your finger to moisten the edges of the wrapper. Add a little over a teaspoon of filling to the middle. Fold the wrapper in half and press the two sides together so you get a firm seal.
Hold the bottom two corners of the little rectangle you just made (the side where the filling is) and bring the two corners together. You can use a bit of water to make sure they stick. And that's it!
At this point, you can cook (boil) and taste a couple of wontons and adjust the seasoning of your filling to taste––you can always add a little more Shaoxing wine, soy sauce, sesame oil, salt, and/or white pepper to your liking.
Once you're happy with the flavor of the filling, keep assembling until all the filling is gone. Place the wontons on a baking sheet or plate lined with parchment paper, and make sure they are not touching (this will prevent sticking).
If you'd like to freeze your wontons right away, you can cover the wontons with plastic wrap, put the baking sheet/plate into the freezer, and transfer them to freezer bags once they’re frozen. They’ll keep for a couple of months in the freezer, and be ready for wonton soup whenever you want it.
To make the soup, heat your chicken stock to a simmer and add 2-3 teaspoons sesame oil and white pepper and salt to taste.
Bring a separate pot of water to a boil. Carefully add the wontons one at a time to the pot. Pick up the pot and use a swirling, twisting motion to keep the pot moving and prevent the wontons from sticking to the bottom. If they do stick, don’t worry, They should come free once they’re cooked. Once they're floating, boil them for another 1-2 minutes. Take care not to overcook them – mushy wontons are a sin!

When the oil starts to pool, you can scoop it out and strain it into a clean, heat-proof jar or container. You can do this gradually as the lard builds up. The whole process will take about an hour. Once it’s done, the rendered pork fat will be a light golden color.
Once the lard is cooled, cover and store it in the refrigerator. The fat will solidify and turn the loveliest creamy white color, and you’ll have plenty of lard to keep in the refrigerator for a few months.

Combine the ground meat with all the marinade ingredients. Stir until the meat has absorbed any standing liquid. Marinate for 15-20 minutes while you prepare the egg mixture.
Make the egg mixture:
To make the egg mixture, crack 3 eggs into a liquid measuring cup and note the volume. Pour the eggs into a large bowl, add salt, and beat for at least 1 minute.
Measure the same volume of water, and add it to the bowl. Do the same with the stock. Whisk the mixture all together along with 1 teaspoon sesame oil, and make sure everything's well combined.

Place a heat-proof shallow bowl in a steamer over high heat. Be sure any water in your steamer will not be able to bubble up and touch the bowl during the steaming process.
Once boiling, turn the heat down to a simmer. Then, pour the egg mixture into the heated bowl through a fine mesh strainer.
Cover the steamer, turn up the heat to high, and steam the eggs for 3 minutes. After 3 minutes have elapsed, shut off the heat, but keep the steamer covered. Let stand for 14 minutes with the lid firmly covered. Cook the meat during this time.
Brown the meat:

Sift together the flour and cornstarch, and add it to the yeast mixture along with the sugar and oil. Turn on the mixer to the lowest setting and let it go until a smooth dough ball is formed. Cover with a damp cloth and let it rest for 2 hours. (I haven't forgotten about the baking powder. You'll add that later!)
While the dough is resting, make the meat filling. Heat the oil in a wok over medium high heat. Add the onion and stir-fry for a minute. Turn heat down to medium-low, and add the sugar, soy sauce, oyster sauce, sesame oil, and dark soy. Stir and cook until the mixture starts to bubble up. Add the chicken stock and flour, cooking for a couple minutes until thickened. Remove from the heat and stir in the roast pork. Set aside to cool. If you make the filling ahead of time, cover and refrigerate to prevent it from drying out.
After your dough has rested for 2 hours, add the baking powder to the dough and turn the mixer on to the lowest setting. At this point, if the dough looks dry or you're having trouble incorporating the baking powder, add 1-2 teaspoons water. Gently knead the dough until it becomes smooth again. Cover with a damp cloth and let it rest for another 15 minutes. In the meantime, get a large piece of parchment paper and cut it into ten 4x4 inch squares. Prepare your steamer by bringing the water to a boil.
Now we are ready to assemble the buns: roll the dough into a long tube and divide it into 10 equal pieces. Press each piece of dough into a disc about 4 1/2 inches in diameter (it should be thicker in the center and thinner around the edges). Add some filling and pleat the buns until they're closed on top.
Place each bun on a parchment paper square, and steam. I steamed the buns in two separate batches using a bamboo steamer (be sure the boiling water does not touch the buns during steaming process).

If you can’t find these bamboo leaves, then you can use parchment paper as a substitute.
Soak your dried shiitake mushrooms in a bowl of hot water and place a small plate on top to ensure they are fully submerged for 30 minutes. Cut the stems off the mushrooms and discard them. Return the mushrooms to the water if they still seem dry inside, since thicker mushrooms will take longer to rehydrate. Finely chop the mushrooms and set aside, reserving the water you used to soak them.
Soak your dried shrimp in hot water for 30 minutes. Pour the shrimp out into a strainer and give them a quick rinse before chopping them.
Heat 5 tablespoons (75 ml) vegetable oil in a frying pan or wok on medium low heat. Scoop out about 2 tablespoons of the heated oil and set aside for brushing the cha guo after they come out of the steamer.
Add the dried shrimp to the oil and stir-fry until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Next, add the ground pork and stir-fry for another 30 seconds, or until it is opaque. Stir in the chopped shiitake mushrooms and the Shaoxing wine.
Next, add the grated daikon radish, chopped scallions, sesame oil, oyster sauce, 1 1/4 teaspoons salt, sugar, and white pepper. Cook on medium low heat until simmering and continue to simmer for another 3 to 4 minutes, or until the daikon radish is just tender.
Combine 2 teaspoons cornstarch with 1/4 cup of the reserved mushroom soaking liquid, being careful to avoid any dirt or sediment that may have settled on the bottom of the bowl. Add to the wok, and continue to cook and stir until all standing liquid has evaporated, about 2 minutes. Set aside and let cool completely.
In a large mixing bowl, combine the glutinous rice flour, all purpose flour, tapioca starch, and the remaining 1 teaspoon salt. Gradually stir 2 cups of boiling water into the dry mixture and continue mixing with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon until a dough begins to form. Once the mixture is cool enough to touch, knead the dough into a smooth ball. Add extra glutinous rice flour 1 tablespoon at a time if the dough is too sticky to knead. Once smooth, cover the dough in the bowl with an overturned plate, and let it rest for 20 minutes.
NOTE: Don’t be thrown off by the amount of dough in the photographs. I made half a batch of dough in these photos, because I decided to freeze the other half of the filling to save for Chinese New Year, when I’ll be making another half batch of fresh dough!
Divide the dough into 24 equal pieces about 45 g each, and keep them covered with a clean, damp kitchen towel to keep them from drying out while assembling the cha guo. I recommend using a digital scale to keep the cha guo rice cakes uniform in size.
Press each small ball of dough to form a flat disc. Use a rolling pin to roll out the edges of the disc until it is about 3 ½ to 4 inches in diameter. It’s important to make the edges of the disc slightly thinner than the middle, or you will have too much dough on one side after you pinch and close the edges.
Next, put 35 g of filling in the middle of the dough disc. Use a spoon to press the filling together into ball so there are no air pockets in the filling. Here, you can again use your kitchen scale to measure how much filling you are using for each cha guo rice cake in order to achieve a uniform size.
Next, pinch the dough around the edges of the disc until the opening is closed. The side of the cha guo tea cake you just closed will be the bottom, so no need to worry if the seam is not smooth. Just make sure it is closed and does not leak.
Next, brush your reserved “cooked” vegetable oil on one of your cut zong leaves and also on the bottom of the cha guo, and place the cha guo onto the leaf. Gently press until it is flattened slightly.
Place the cha guo in a bamboo steamer or metal steamer, ensuring that there is at least an inch of space between each one. You should be able to fit 4 to 5 cha guo rice cakes on one level. Stack your bamboo steamer levels to steam more tea cakes in one batch. Steam your cha guo rice tea cakes in batches for 10 minutes each.
Once done, sprinkle a pinch of toasted sesame seeds on top of each rice cake and gently press them in place. Use a basting brush to lightly brush some of the cooked oil you reserved earlier over each cha guo to prevent them from drying out.
Remove the cha guo to a plate and serve them warm anytime! You can also let them cool completely and freeze them on a plate, placing a layer of plastic or parchment paper between each layer. Keep them in an airtight freezer bag for up to 1 month.",en-US,"{'calories': '199 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '34 g', 'proteinContent': '5 g', 'fatContent': '5 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '1 g', 'cholesterolContent': '17 mg', 'sodiumContent': '311 mg', 'fiberContent': '1 g', 'sugarContent': '1 g', 'servingSize': '1 serving'}",4.86,,The Woks of Life,180,24 serving(s)

In a clean, dry wok or cast iron skillet over medium heat, add the sea salt and Sichuan peppercorns. Stir the mixture for 25-30 minutes, until the salt starts to turn light brown. BE VERY CAREFUL during this process. Although there isn’t much indication in the form of steam or smoke from the mixture as you stir, the sea salt does get extremely hot, so handle with care! Once the sea salt turns light brown, turn off the heat, and let the mixture cool.
Now rinse the pork belly under cold water, and pat it thoroughly dry with paper towels. Once the sea salt mixture has cooled, but is still warm to the touch, remove ⅓ cup and set it aside. Place the pork belly on a rimmed sheet pan or in a casserole dish, and rub (press) the remaining salt mixture evenly onto the pork belly on ALL sides, the goal is to get the salt and Sichuan peppercorns onto the pork belly. Weigh down the pork belly with a couple of flat stones or bricks that have been wrapped in foil. Cover with plastic wrap and transfer to the refrigerator.
Day 2:
Take out your pork belly and pour off any liquid that collected in the pan. After all the liquid is drained, evenly apply the ⅓ cup of the salt mixture that you put aside the day before.
Put the stones/bricks back on, cover the pork belly with plastic wrap, and put back in the refrigerator.
Day 4:
Take the pork belly out and pour off any liquid.
Put the stones/bricks back on top of the pork, replace the plastic wrap, and put it back in the refrigerator.
Day 6:
Take out the pork belly, and rinse it under cold water to wash away all the peppercorns and visible sea salt crystals.
Pat it dry with paper towels, string it up with thick kitchen twine, and hang it in a place that’s cool and dry (and where no critters will be able to get to it) for 4-5 days until the meat is dry to the touch, but not too hard to cut. You don’t want to dry out the meat too much, or it will become tough and difficult to slice.
P.S. Feel free to marinate the pork for a couple of days longer if you like it saltier.

Make sure to find fatty ground pork. You can choose a fatty piece of pork shoulder and have the butcher grind it, or use our hand-chopping method to grind your own. A 70/30 meat to fat ratio is best, but 80/20 is also acceptable. Transfer the ground pork to a large mixing bowl.
Add the minced ginger and scallions, egg, breadcrumbs, Shaoxing wine, light soy sauce, oyster sauce, white pepper, five spice powder, cornstarch, and water.
Whip everything in one direction for about 10 minutes, until the meat mixture resembles a paste. This step is very important to making sure the meatballs have the right texture and don’t fall apart during frying.
Smash the water chestnuts with the side of your cleaver or knife and finely mince them. Add to the meat mixture and continue to mix everything together for 5 more minutes. Use a rubber spatula to scrape everything together.
Heat enough oil to submerge the meatballs in a small, deep pot (a small pot requires less oil) to 350 degrees F/175 degrees C. Just be sure there’s enough oil to cook the meatballs evenly, but that the oil will not overflow during frying.
With oiled hands, divide the meat mixture into 8 to 9 equal portions and shape each into a ball. Carefully lower the meatballs one at a time into the heated oil, and fry in batches (2 minutes per batch) until they’re evenly golden brown. Remove the par-cooked meatballs with a slotted spoon and set aside.
Make the sauce & braise:
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a wok over low heat. Add the ginger and white parts of the scallions, and cook for 1 minute. Then add the sugar and cook until dissolved.
Add 1 tablespoon Shaoxing wine, 1 ½ tablespoons light soy sauce, 1/4 teaspoon dark soy sauce, 1 tablespoon oyster sauce and 1 ½ cup water. Stir and bring the liquid to a boil.
Once boiling, add the fried meatballs. Cover and cook for 12-15 minutes over medium/low heat, flipping the meatballs halfway through.
After simmering, there should be about ¾ cup liquid left. Remove the meatballs from the liquid and arrange on your serving plate. (I served these with blanched baby bok choy. Just add a teaspoon or two of vegetable oil to boiling water for that “shiny” look, and blanch for 30 seconds).
Mix your cornstarch slurry, and pour into the sauce to thicken. Once it’s thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, stir in ¼ teaspoon sesame oil and the green parts of the scallions.

Don’t move the bacon around for the first minute or so. If it’s getting too dark, turn the heat down slightly. The fat should start melting and crisping.
Next, using chopsticks or a spatula, flip the bacon when it’s partially browned but not fully cooked. Cook that side to the same level as the other. Next, grab your wok spatula and stir-fry the bacon with the heat on high to evenly crisp it to your liking. This is the method that yields a mix of crisp and chewy bits of bacon! If you like your bacon uniformly crispy, instead of using your wok spatula, flip the bacon a third time, and let it fry a little longer over lower heat.
Note that the grease pools in the wok, so when the bacon is done, push it to the sides and let gravity do the work of draining. Transfer to a plate when drained.
Next, with the heat on medium-high, lay the bread slices around the perimeter of the wok. You can use your spatula to drizzle over a bit more of the bacon drippings if you want a super crisp and decadent sandwich.
Assemble the sandwiches by laying 3-4 slices of bacon across each sandwich.

Shanghai Style Pork Zongzi (Sticky Rice Dumplings),Judy,https://thewoksoflife.com/sticky-rice-dumpling-shanghai-pork-zongzi/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/sticky-rice-dumpling-11.jpg,"['75-80 dried bamboo leaves ((2 to 3 leaves per zongzi))', '5 pounds uncooked short grain sticky rice ((also called glutinous rice, or ""sweet rice""))', '3 pounds pork belly ((and/or pork shoulder))', 'Kitchen twine to tie the zongzi', '¼ cup light soy sauce', '3 tablespoons dark soy sauce', '4 teaspoons salt', '5 tablespoons sugar', '3 tablespoons Shaoxing wine', '1 teaspoon white pepper', '1 teaspoon five spice powder', '¼ cup water ((you may not need this, but if you do, you’ll add 2 tablespoons at a time))', '5 tablespoons light soy sauce', '5 tablespoons dark soy sauce', '1½ tablespoons sugar', '2½ tablespoons salt']","The night before: Soak the zongzi leaves by weighing them down in a bowl of water with a heavy object. They should be completely submerged. In a large container, soak the glutinous rice in water, making sure the water level is 3-4 inches above the rice, as it will expand considerably as it soaks. Cut the pork belly into 1-inch x 2-inch chunks. Combine the pork with all the marinade ingredients except the water (the light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, salt, sugar, Shaoxing wine, white pepper, and five-spice powder), and mix everything well. It may seem like a lot of salt, but the rice will absorb the saltiness during the cooking process. If there is no visible liquid after mixing, add water, 2 tablespoons at a time. Pork can soak up a lot of liquid and the liquid will help to keep it moist. The pork marinade should be wet, but without too much liquid pooling at the bottom.
The next day: Completely drain the rice using a fine-meshed colander or sieve. Mix in the rice marinade ingredients (the light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, sugar, and salt), and mix everything well. Set aside, and marinate for about 30 minutes. In the meantime, wash each leaf front and back with a soft cloth, and rinse. Transfer them to a bowl of fresh water until you’re ready to wrap the zongzi so they don’t dry out. Lay out all the components: the pork, the rice, zongzi leaves, and kitchen twine. Now you’re ready to start wrapping zongzi! Follow the step-by-step photos on how to wrap them. There will be visible sauce at the bottom of the rice when you get to the end, simply drain it out once you start to see this, as you don’t want any excess liquid in the zongzi.
To cook the zongzi, neatly and tightly nest all the zongzi in a large soup pot. Ideally, there will be no visible gaps. If necessary, put a large heatproof plate directly on top of the zongzi to weigh them down. Fill the pot with cold water until they are completely submerged. Place the pot on the stove over high heat. Once the water boils, turn the heat to medium-low, and let it simmer for at least 4-5 hours. The water should be “moving” at a light simmer; definitely not boiling. Check the pot fairly often to make sure the zongzi are always submerged in water. Add only boiling water so the water temperature never gets too low.",en-US,"{'calories': '439 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '54 g', 'proteinContent': '9 g', 'fatContent': '20 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '7 g', 'cholesterolContent': '27 mg', 'sodiumContent': '991 mg', 'fiberContent': '2 g', 'sugarContent': '2 g', 'servingSize': '1 serving'}",5.0,,The Woks of Life,960,36 serving(s)

Place it skin-side down on a tray, and rub the Shaoxing wine into the meat (not the skin). Mix together the salt, sugar, five spice powder and white pepper. Thoroughly rub this spice mixture into the meat as well. Flip the meat over so it’s skin-side up.
So, to do the next step, you'll need a sharp metal skewer. Systematically poke holes ALL over the skin, which will help the skin crisp up, rather than stay smooth and leathery. The more holes there are, the better, really. Let it dry out in the fridge uncovered, for 12-24 hours.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Place a large piece of aluminum foil (heavy duty foil works best) onto a baking tray, and fold up the sides around the pork snugly, so that you’re creating a kind of box all around it, with a 1-inch high border going around the sides.
Brush the rice wine vinegar on top of the pork skin. Pack the sea salt in one even layer over the skin, so the pork is completely covered. Place in the oven and roast for 1 hour and 30 minutes. If your pork belly still has the rib attached, roast for 1 hour and 45 minutes.
Take the pork out of the oven, turn on the broiler to low, and position the oven rack in the lowest position. Remove the top layer of sea salt from the pork belly, and unfold the foil. Put the pork back under the broiler to crisp up. This should take 5-10 minutes. The broiler should ideally be on “low” so that this process can happen gradually. If your broiler gets pretty hot, be sure to keep the pork as far away from the heat source as possible. Keep a close eye on it to prevent burning!

Transfer the meat to a deep dish plate, forming a kind of thin patty. You must use a deep dish because liquid will pool in the bowl (it's almost like a thin broth or sauce, and it's great over rice!).
Distribute the slices of salted fish on top of the meat. If you put a lot of fish on top, then you may want to eliminate or reduce the salt from the ground meat in the previous step. If you put only a few slices of salted fish, then the fish will likely provide enough salt for the dish. It’s definitely about personal preferences when it comes to how salty you like it!
Spread the julienned ginger across the top of the meat and salted fish and then sprinkle the chopped scallion evenly over the top. Steam for 10 minutes starting with a pre-heated steamer.

Soak your dried shiitake mushrooms in a bowl of hot water for 30 minutes. Place a small plate on top to ensure they’re fully submerged. Cut the stems off the mushrooms and discard them. Return the mushrooms to the water if they still seem dry inside, since thicker mushrooms will take longer to rehydrate. Finely chop the mushrooms and set aside, reserving the soaking water.
Also soak your dried shrimp in hot water for 30 minutes. Strain and rinse them before chopping them. Rinse the salted preserved radish under running water and pat dry before chopping.
Heat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in your wok over medium low heat. Add the dried shrimp and cook until fragrant (about a minute). Next, add the ground pork and stir-fry for 30 seconds, or just until the pork is no longer pink.

While the filling cools, make the dough. Mix 3½ cups glutinous rice flour and ½ teaspoon salt in a large bowl.

If the dough is too sticky, simply add more glutinous rice flour 1 tablespoon at a time until the dough forms a smooth ball.
Next, pinch off three small pieces of dough to form three balls about 1 inch in diameter. Cook in a small pot of boiling water until they float, about 6 to 7 minutes. Now, add them to the raw dough, kneading them in until the dough is soft and smooth. I have to admit when I did this, I was slightly worried the dough wouldn’t come together, but give it a few minutes of kneading, and it does!
Now, divide the dough into 24 equal pieces about 32 grams each (a digital kitchen scale helps to ensure each is the same size), Keep them covered with a clean, damp kitchen towel to prevent drying while assembling your Savory Tang Yuan.
Take your filling out of the refrigerator, stirring it to redistribute the ingredients. There should be no visible liquid, and the filling should be somewhat dry.
Use your fingers to form each dough ball into a round disc. Spoon about 1 tablespoon (15 g) of filling on the center of the disc. Use the spoon to lightly pack the filling so there are no air pockets. Fold over the edges of the dough to close the tang yuan, lightly pressing in the savory filling if needed. If the dough breaks, you can use a small piece of dough to patch it, using a little dab of glutinous rice flour and water to spackle it back together. Keep a small bowl of both handy for this purpose.
Next, gently roll the tang yuan between the palms of your hands to shape it into a uniform round ball. Set your finished tang yuan on a piece of parchment paper that has been lightly dusted with glutinous rice flour. Repeat this process until you have made all of the savory tang yuan. You’ll need another clean, damp kitchen cloth to cover them. Repeat these steps until you’ve assembled all the tang yuan.
To cook the tang yuan, boil water in a medium pot (you’ll need at least a 4” depth of water). Use a slotted spoon to gently lower the tang yuan into the boiling water, stirring so they don’t have a chance to stick to the pot. Don’t overfill your pot, as this makes it difficult to cook the tang yuan evenly. Lower the heat to a slow boil.
Cook for 6 to 8 minutes or until your Savory Tang Yuan float to the top, stirring periodically.
Spoon your savory tang yuan into bowls with some of the cooking water. Add seasonings like sesame oil, salt, and scallions and/or cilantro to taste.",en-US,"{'calories': '358 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '60 g', 'proteinContent': '9 g', 'fatContent': '9 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '5 g', 'cholesterolContent': '33 mg', 'sodiumContent': '422 mg', 'fiberContent': '2 g', 'sugarContent': '1 g', 'servingSize': '1 serving'}",-1.0,,The Woks of Life,180,8 serving(s)

Marinate with 1 tablespoon light soy sauce, ½ teaspoon salt, 1 tablespoon Shaoxing wine, and 3 tablespoons water, working the ingredients thoroughly into the pork pieces. Cover and transfer to the refrigerator.
In a medium bowl (large enough to fit all the pork), dissolve the potato starch in 1½ cups of water, and stir until completely dissolved. Set aside for 15 minutes, or until the potato starch has completely settled to the bottom.
Now prepare the sauce by mixing the sugar, vinegar, ½ teaspoon salt, and sesame oil together. Stir to dissolve, and set aside.
Take your potato starch, and slowly drain out the majority of the water, leaving behind the potato starch paste. Add the pork slices to the bowl, and use your hands to ensure the pork is completely coated in the wet potato starch. Add a tablespoon of water at a time if the mixture is too dry and hard to work with.
Prepare the oil for frying in a deep pot or wok, heating it slowly to 250 - 300 degrees F––no higher, or the pork will overcook. Carefully lower the pork pieces, one at a time, into the oil, leaving space in between, as they tend to stick together. Fry each batch for 2 minutes, transferring the fried pork to a wire rack to drain. When all of the pork has been fried once, bring the oil back up to 250 - 300 degrees F and fry the pork again in batches for about 30 seconds each batch.
Now you’re ready to put together the rest of the dish. If you fried the pork in your wok, carefully pour the hot oil into a heat-proof container, leaving about 1 tablespoon of it behind.
Heat the wok over medium heat. Cook the ginger and garlic briefly. Add the sauce mixture, turn up the heat, and cook for about 2-3 minutes. You should have about ⅓ cup of sauce in the wok after it’s reduced. Next, add the carrot, scallions, cilantro, and fried pork.

Italian Pork Sandwiches (DiNic's Copycat Philly Pork Sandwich),Kaitlin,https://thewoksoflife.com/italian-pork-sandwich-philly/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/italian-pork-sandwiches-15.jpg,"['4-5 pounds skinless pork shoulder (butterflied)', 'Salt', '1½ tablespoons ground fennel seeds', '1½ tablespoons dried thyme', '2 tablespoons dried oregano', '1 tablespoon fresh rosemary ((minced))', '3 tablespoons fresh parsley ((minced))', '16 cloves garlic ((minced))', '2 yellow onions ((thinly sliced))', 'Olive oil', '4 cups pork, chicken or beef stock', '½ cup red wine', '15 oz. can crushed tomatoes ((425 g))', '2 bay leaves', '2 green bell peppers', '7 long hot green peppers', '2 tablespoons olive oil', '1 teaspoon salt', '¼ cup olive oil', '7 cloves garlic ((chopped))', '¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes', '2 pounds broccoli rabe ((washed thoroughly and chopped into ½ inch pieces))', '12 crusty Italian rolls', '3-4 slices sharp provolone per sandwich', 'Jarred pepperoncinis']","Marinate the meat the night before. If needed, trim the skin off of the pork shoulder while you’re butterflying it, but don’t trim away the fat cap on top. We used a 4-pound piece off of a larger cut, so we also had a small bone to butterfly around.
Sprinkle evenly all over with salt (to avoid oversalting, sprinkle it from a height above the meat so it spreads evenly without needing to use a ton). Combine 1½ tablespoons ground fennel seeds, 1½ tablespoons dried thyme, 2 tablespoons dried oregano, and 1 tablespoon fresh minced rosemary leaves. Generously rub the meat all over with this seasoning. Next, stir together the 3 tablespoons of minced parsley and the minced garlic. Spread the majority on the inner parts of the butterflied pork shoulder, and distribute the rest on the top.
Rebundle the pork shoulder so it is in a relatively tight roll. Place in a roasting pan, and surround with the thinly sliced onion. Drizzle a little olive oil over the onions. Refrigerate overnight.
The next day, take your pork out of the refrigerator early (about 2 hours before you’re ready to roast) to come up to room temperature. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F, and position a rack in the lower third of the oven, and one in the upper third.
You’re going to roast the pork and the peppers simultaneously, so wash the peppers, pat them dry, and cut them all lengthwise and deseed them (If you like your long hots really hot, skip that step!) Toss in olive oil, and sprinkle with salt. Lay out evenly on a baking sheet.
Place the roast in the lower third of the oven, and the peppers on the rack in the upper third. Roast at 450 degrees F for 35 minutes. After 35 minutes, remove the peppers from the oven and set them aside. Later, you can reheat the peppers by stirring them into the hot pulled pork to rewarm them, or by putting them back in the oven in the final stretch of cooking.
Also take the pork out of the oven at this step, and add the stock, wine, tomatoes, and bay leaves. Stir to combine. Cover the pan tightly with aluminum foil. Cook for another 15 minutes at 450 degrees F, and then reduce the oven temperature to 325 degrees F. Continue roasting the pork for 2 hours.
Carefully remove the foil (you'll be putting it back on). Using a sharp carving knife, cut the roast into large chunks, laying them flat in the braising liquid. Re-cover with foil and cook for another 2 to 2 ½ hours, until the pork is fork tender.
A little while before you take your pork out of the oven, it’s time to prepare your broccoli rabe. In a skillet over medium-high heat, add ¼ cup of olive oil and 7 cloves chopped garlic. Let the garlic brown lightly, and add the crushed red pepper flakes, followed by the chopped broccoli rabe. Cook until wilted, and then lower the heat if needed to cook until tender––you don’t want the stems to be crunchy!
Remove the pork from the oven. Discard the bay leaves. Pull the pork in the pan with two forks, mixing everything in the juices.
Stir in your reserved roasted peppers to rewarm them. Alternatively, you could reheat them in the oven in the last 10-15 minutes of roasting.
To build each sandwich, grab your Italian bread/rolls, and slice them lengthwise. Lay down a healthy bed of sharp provolone slices (we went with sharp provolone from the deli counter, but if you really want to be authentic to the OG sandwich, get a wedge of super sharp provolone and cut it into rough, thick shavings), and toast to melt the cheese. Top with a generous, drippy helping of pulled pork. Spoon over the broccoli rabe, and nestle a few pieces of long green hot pepper and bell pepper inside.

Time to drain the soybeans. Add the soybeans, along with the rock sugar, dark soy sauce, light soy sauce, Shaoxing wine, and water. Stir thoroughly, and cover. Let the pork trotters braise for 70-80 minutes on low heat until tender. Be sure to stir periodically to prevent sticking. Towards the end of the cooking time, add salt to taste. Don’t prolong the cooking too much. In this case, “falling off the bone” is not what we want.

Bring to a boil and simmer over low heat for 1 hour until the chicken is falling off the bone. Set the chicken aside and strain the water (now turned into stock!) into a large bowl.
While the chicken is cooking, heat the 2 tbsp. of vegetable oil in a sauté pan. Add the okra and sauté over medium high heat until the “ropiness” is gone (i.e the goopy strands of okra-ness). When the okra is done, turn off the heat and set it aside.
Now comes the important step of making the signature gumbo roux. In the large pot you initially used for the chicken, add 2/3 cup vegetable oil and 3/4 cup flour. Whisk constantly for 20 minutes. Start with medium-low heat, and as it turns darker, switch to low heat. The roux should be a dark caramel color.
When you’ve got the perfect color for your roux, add the onion, bell pepper, celery, and garlic to the pot. Sauté them until tender, coating everything in that roux. This can take a bit of time, as you want the heat still around medium or medium-low to make sure the roux doesn’t burn.
When the veggies are tender, add the sliced sausage. Once the sausage is lightly browned, add the sautéed okra, and the tomatoes. Cook for 15 minutes. This is a good time to remove the skin and bone from the chicken thighs and roughly shred them with your hands or two forks.
Add the chicken stock and shredded chicken and stir until combined. Then, season the entire mixture with the bay leaves, thyme, basil, cayenne pepper, paprika, salt, and pepper. Mix thoroughly and bring to a low boil. Simmer for 1 hour with the pot loosely covered, stirring occasionally. After an hour, add the hot sauce and adjust seasoning if needed.

When you’re ready to cook, heat 1 tablespoon oil in a wok over medium heat. Add the mushrooms and stir-fry until caramelized. Remove from the wok and set aside.
Add another tablespoon of oil to the wok (over high heat this time), and brown the marinated ribs. Once browned, turn the heat down to medium, and add the ginger, garlic, and sugar. Stir-fry for a minute, and then add the carrots, light soy sauce, and ½ cup water. Bring to a simmer and cook for 5-10 minutes, until the liquid has almost all evaporated.
While the ribs are simmering, add the rice to the rice cooker and add the proper amount of water (according to your rice cooker instructions/type of rice you’re using). This is when you can strain and add some of the liquid the mushrooms were soaking in, if desired. Alternatively, you could also use chicken, pork, or vegetable stock.
Stir in the shiitake mushrooms and 1 teaspoon salt. Shake the pot around a little so the rice and liquid is in an even layer. Spread the rib mixture over the rice. Place it into the rice cooker and press the button to start it. Your dinner is now underway.

Preheat your oven to 325 degrees and prepare a roasting pan lined with heavy duty foil for easy clean-up. Add about 2 cups of water to the pan so there is about a half inch of water. This keeps the ribs moist and catches the drippings. Place a roasting rack on top of the pan and place your ribs on the rack (rib side up).
Slow roast the ribs for about 30 minutes. Flip them over and continue roasting for another 60 minutes. You will need less time if using baby back ribs since they are smaller and more tender.

Wrap everything in cheesecloth and tie securely with kitchen string. Set aside.
Rinse the pork. Don’t worry if there are any bristles remaining in the skin––we’ll take care of them after the blanching step.
Place the pork in a medium to large pot along with 5 slices of ginger and 2 tablespoons of Shaoxing wine. Fill the pot with enough water to just cover the pork. Bring to a boil. Once boiling, cook for 1 final minute and turn off the heat.
Carefully drain the pork and ginger slices, and wash both the pot and the pork clean. If there are still visible bristles on the skin, now is a good time to remove them with tweezers. After the ti pang is clean, pat it very dry with a paper towel.
Heat 3 tablespoons of oil in a wok over medium heat. Brown the ti pang on all sides until the skin is lightly crisp and brown. This process takes 10-15 minutes. Use your spatula to scoop hot oil over any area that can’t touch the wok’s surface. Turn off the heat, remove the ti pang, and set aside.
Reduce the heat to low, and add the rock sugar to the remaining oil in the wok. Once the sugar has melted, add the 5 reserved slices of ginger, garlic, and scallion whites. Stir and cook for 2 minutes. Add the Shaoxing wine, light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, and water. Turn up the heat and bring to a boil. Turn off the heat.
Place the ti pang in a deep pot with just enough room to hold it and eventually flip it over. Transfer the sauce from the wok to this pot. There should be enough liquid to submerge the ti pang about 75%. If not, add a little more water. Lastly, add the spice pouch.
Cover the pot, turn up the heat, and bring to a boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium low and cook the ti pang for 3 hours with the lid on (the liquid in the pot should have small bubbles). Flip the ti pang every half hour to ensure it’s cooked evenly.
Once the ti pang is so tender that it can barely hold its shape and you can easily pull out the center bone, transfer to a serving bowl. Skim the fat from the sauce. Turn up the heat to reduce the sauce until it becomes a thin gravy (you can also thicken it with some cornstarch slurry). Add salt to taste and ¼ teaspoon sesame oil right before serving.
Pour the sauce over the ti pang in the serving bowl.

"Hunan Pork and Tofu Spicy Stir Fry, by thewoksoflife.com",Bill,https://thewoksoflife.com/hunan-pork-tofu/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/hunan-pork-6.jpg,"['10 ounces pork ((280g, sliced ⅛-inch thick))', '2 tablespoons water', '1 teaspoon oil', '1 teaspoon cornstarch', '6 tablespoons vegetable or canola oil ((divided))', '1 pound firm tofu ((450g, drained and cut into 2-inch squares, ½-inch thick))', '1 teaspoon ginger ((minced))', '2 tablespoons spicy bean sauce ((doubanjiang))', '3 scallions ((cut on an angle into 2-inch pieces))', '2 teaspoons fresh garlic ((minced))', '3 tablespoons fermented black beans', '1 red bell pepper ((cut into 1x2-inch pieces, about 1½ cups))', '1 tablespoon Shaoxing wine', '¾ teaspoon sugar', '⅓ cup hot water or chicken stock', '1 teaspoon cornstarch ((mixed with 1 tablespoon water))']","In a bowl, add 2 tablespoons of water to the pork slices and massage until the pork absorbs all of the water. Next, add the oil and cornstarch, mix thoroughly until the pork is coated, and set aside.
Heat your wok over high heat, and spread 2 tablespoons of oil around the wok to evenly coat the surface. Add the tofu slices to the wok in one layer, and let them sear. Don’t move them for a least 1 minute! Tilt your wok so the oil reaches the tofu on all sides. Add more oil if needed.
After another 1 to 2 minutes, the tofu should be browned, and it should not stick to the wok. You may have use a metal spatula to loosen the pieces slightly. Turn down the heat, and carefully flip all of the tofu slices. After the tofu is golden brown on both sides, transfer to a plate. They should be much easier to handle now.
Over high heat, add another 2 tablespoons of oil to your wok. When the wok just starts to smoke a bit, immediately add the pork. Spread the pork around the wok using your metal spatula, and let the meat sear for 20 seconds on one side. Stir fry for another 15 seconds, and scoop out the meat into your marinade bowl. It should be about 80% cooked.
Using the same wok, turn the heat to low, and immediately add 2 tablespoons oil, the minced ginger, the spicy chili bean paste (dou ban jiang), and the white parts of the scallions. Stir this mixture into the oil and let it fry at low heat for 15 seconds to infuse the oil and bring out a rich red color.
Next, add the garlic, black beans, red bell peppers, and the rest of the scallions. Turn the heat to high, and give everything a good stir-frying for 45 seconds. The red pepper will sear and add more natural red color to this dish!
Add the pork and juices from your marinade bowl and the tofu back to the wok. Next, spread 1 tablespoon of Shaoxing wine around the perimeter of the wok, add the sugar, and continue to stir-fry for 15 seconds. Be gentle so you don’t break up the tofu.
After another 15 seconds of stir-frying, spread the hot chicken stock or water around the perimeter of the wok to deglaze it. Continue to stir fry for another 30 seconds, being sure to spread the liquid to the sides of the wok to further deglaze it. (Notice we did not add salt or soy sauce, since the combination of the spicy bean paste and the fermented soybeans is quite salty.)
At this point, you can continue to stir-fry the dish until most of the liquid is reduced, or add the water and cornstarch to thicken any standing liquid.
