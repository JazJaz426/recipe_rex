Fluffy Japanese Souffle Pancakes,Namiko Chen,https://www.justonecookbook.com/souffle-pancake/,Japanese,https://www.justonecookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Fluffy-Japanese-Souffle-Pancake-4.jpg,"['2 large eggs (50 g each w/o shell)', '1 ½ Tbsp whole milk', '¼ tsp pure vanilla extract', '¼ cup cake flour', '½ tsp baking powder', '2 Tbsp sugar', '1 Tbsp neutral-flavored oil (vegetable, canola, etc) ((for greasing the pan))', '2 Tbsp water ((for steaming))', '½ cup heavy (whipping) cream', '1 ½ Tbsp sugar ((not so sweet, you can add more if you like))', '1 Tbsp confectioners’ sugar/powdered sugar', 'fresh berries ((strawberries, blueberries, etc))', 'maple syrup']","Gather all the ingredients.You will also need a 12-inch non-stick frying pan (large enough to cook 3 pancakes at the same time) with a lid.
Separate egg whites and egg yolks into two different bowls. Put the bowl with egg whites in the freezer for 15 minutes. Why do we freeze egg whites? Please read 3 Tips to Make Perfect Meringue (Egg Whites) in this post.
In the meantime, add milk and vanilla to the egg yolks and whisk until thick and frothy.
Sift the cake flour and baking powder into the bowl.
Whisk to combine thoroughly (but do not over-mix) and set aside.
After 15 minutes, take out the bowl with egg whites from the freezer. The egg whites should be half frozen. Now start beating egg whites.
When the egg whites turn frothy and pale white, gradually add in sugar (roughly ⅓ at a time). Continue to whip the egg whites.
The egg whites will become glossier and firmer. Stop beating when you lift up the hand mixer and the egg whites stand right up with stiff peaks slightly bending over.
Heat the large non-stick frying pan to 300ºF (150ºC) over the lowest heat. Brush with cooking oil and lightly remove any visible oil (otherwise the pancakes will have a spotty pattern). Keep the heat on while you combine egg whites and egg yolk mixture.
Take ⅓ of egg whites and add to the egg yolk mixture. Whisk together (don’t worry too much about breaking air bubbles at this step).
Next, take half of the egg whites and add to the egg yolk mixture. Using a whisk, gently fold in without breaking the air bubbles in the egg whites. Why do we use a whisk instead of a silicone spatula? Please read 3 Tips to Make Perfect Meringue (Egg Whites) in this post.
Now transfer the egg yolk mixture into egg whites. Carefully fold in two mixtures together without breaking the air bubbles. Make sure to gently mix the batter thoroughly!
For my stove and frying pan, I kept 300 ºF (150 ºC) all times on low heat. Remember each pancake gets roughly 4 scoops of batter, so that’s a total of 12 scoops for 3 pancakes. Now, scoop the batter and place on the frying pan. My recommendation is to use a small ladle (or a serving spoon that’s bigger than a regular spoon - probably 2-3 Tbsp) and make a tall pancake. Next, stack one more scoop to the first pancake. Then move on to the next two pancakes giving each 2 small scoops.
By the time all 3 pancakes have 2 scoops, the surface of the batter is slightly dry already, so you can stack one more scoop on top, keeping it up high. In the bowl, you should still have roughly 3 scoops left (if you have slightly more, that’s okay).
Set timer for 6-7 minutes, add 1 Tbsp water in 3 empty spaces inside the pan and cover with the lid. Water keeps the pancake moist. Please note: the suggested time is just a guideline and it’s based on the stove and frying pan that I'm using.
After 2 minutes passed, open the lid, and add one more scoop for each pancake (or more scoops if you have more batter). Make sure to stack high, not wide. If the water has evaporated, add a little bit more. Cover with lid and cook.
After 6-7 minutes passed, using the offset spatula, lift the pancake VERY GENTLY. If you feel the pancake is stuck, don’t touch until they firm up a little. If you force it, the pancake will crack in the middle. When the pancake is ready, you can easily move the pancake.
Here is another set of images to show the process. Slightly pull the pancake to create an empty space and gently flip over with “rolling over” motion.
Add water in empty spaces and set a timer for 4 to 5 minutes to cook the other side on the lowest heat.
Once they are nicely browned, transfer the pancakes to your serving plates.
Place fresh cream on the pancakes and top with berries. Dust the pancake with confectioners’ sugar and drizzle with maple syrup. Enjoy!
Fresh Whipped Cream
Prepare an ice bath by putting ice cubes and water in a large bowl and placing a clean and dry mixing bowl over. Add heavy cream and sugar to keep cool.
Whisk on high speed until medium to firm peaks form (should not be runny, but soft and fluffy firm whipped cream). Keep it chilled until you're ready to serve the pancakes.",en-US,{},4.54,,Just One Cookbook,45,3 serving(s)

I follow the 1 to 5 rice-to-water ratio for my Okayu recipe.
Rinse the rice in water, then drain. Repeat until the water runs clear.
Soak the rice in the pot for at least 30 minutes.
After 30 minutes, drain the water completely.
Then add 250 ml of water into the pot.
Cover the pot and bring to a boil over high heat.
When boiling, lower the heat to the stove’s lowest setting (make sure to use the right size of stove burner for your pot size). Open the lid and gently mix with the spoon once, making sure rice is not stuck to the bottom of the pot.
Cover the lid and simmer the rice for 30 minutes (Tip: With a good size pot and the lowest heat on the stove, the water should not boil over. If you cook with more water or your pot is smaller than my pot, you may want to cover the lid at a slight angle so the water doesn’t boil over). During this time, I never open the lid or mix the rice. (Tip: If you are worried, you can take a quick peek and make sure there’s enough water so the rice doesn’t burn the bottom of the pot. If necessary, you can stir the pot or add “hot” water. Otherwise, don’t touch the rice because you would end up breaking the nice shape of rice kernels.)
After 30 minutes, turn off the heat and let it steam for 10 minutes. The rice should be soft and thickened. If you want to add something, like a beaten egg or salt, this is the time to add. I keep this recipe plain and simple. Serve into the individual rice bowls and garnish and put toppings of your choice.",en-US,{},4.7,,Just One Cookbook,65,1 serving(s)
Curry Bread,Namiko Chen,https://www.justonecookbook.com/curry-bread/,Japanese,https://www.justonecookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Curry-Bread-w600.jpg,"['1 ¼ cup bread flour', '⅓ cup cake flour ((⅓ cup + 1 Tbsp to be precise))', '1 tsp kosher/sea salt (I use Diamond Crystal; Use half for table salt)', '1 Tbsp sugar ((1 Tbsp + ½ tsp))', '1 tsp instant yeast ((1 tsp; see Notes if you use ACTIVE dry yeast))', '½ cup whole milk ((½ cup + 1 tsp; I highly recommend using whole milk instead of non-fat or reduced-fat milk.))', '1 Tbsp unsalted butter ((should be a bit less than 1 Tbsp; 1 Tbsp butter is 14 g but you will need 10 g))', '1 ½ cup Japanese curry of your choice', '1 large egg (50 g w/o shell) ((for coating the bread; I forgot to put in the ingredient picture below))', '1 cup panko (Japanese breadcrumbs)', '4 cups neutral-flavored oil (vegetable, canola, etc)']","Gather all the ingredients. Leave the unsalted butter and Japanese curry at room temperature.
To make the dough:
In a large bowl, whisk together bread flour (150 g), cake flour (50 g), kosher salt (3 g), and sugar (15 g).
Microwave the milk (125 ml) until warm to the touch, about 95ºF/35ºC. Then add in the instant dry yeast (3 g) and the warm milk.
Using the silicone spatula, combine the wet and dry ingredients together until it becomes a rough dough. [1-2 minutes]
Once the dough becomes a ball, add the unsalted butter (10 g) in the center of the dough and combine well until the butter is incorporated into the dough. At first, the dough will be sticky, wet, and oily and you might want to add more flour, but wait and try kneading a little longer. [2-3 minutes]
Once you don’t see any big chunks of butter, transfer the dough from the bowl to a lightly floured surface. Knead the dough until it becomes smooth and pliable. Read the tip on kneading below. [5 minutes]
Tip on kneading: Using the lower part of your palm, push out the dough. Then roll back up as if you’re drawing the number “8” with your hand. Rotate the dough 90 degrees every time you finish drawing “8”.
After drawing “8” a few times, bang the dough onto the work surface and fold it over away from you. This helps develop gluten (elasticity). Turn the dough 90 degrees and repeat drawing “8” again. Continue this process until the dough is smooth, supple, and silky.
When the dough is moist, smooth, and pliable, form a ball. Place the seam side down on the working surface and twist the ball a few times to close the seam.
Place the dough back into the bowl, seam side down, cover with plastic wrap, and let rise at 100ºF (38ºC) for 60 minutes, or until doubled in size (I used proof setting in my oven).
Dust your finger with flour and poke the center of the dough. If the dough doesn’t close up, it’s ready.
Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and gently punch/press it down.
Fold the dough into thirds widthwise.
Fold the dough into thirds lengthwise.
Turn upside down so the seam is facing down. Twist the dough to form a nice ball shape.
Measure the weight of the dough on a kitchen scale and divide the number by 8. Roughly cut the dough into 8 pieces.
Weigh each piece of dough and cut off the extra dough if it weighs more than you calculated.
Add the extra dough to the smaller dough piece(s). Hide the extra dough in the center of the small dough by pulling the dough from the side.
Twist the dough to seal the seam on your hand. Place the 8 dough balls on the baking sheet lined with a silicone baking mat (or parchment paper). Cover with plastic wrap, and let rest for 15 minutes at room temperature.
To form the curry bread:
Place the dough seam side up and flatten out each piece with your hand. Fold in thirds widthwise.
Fold in thirds lengthwise, and then turn it upside down so the seam side is on the bottom.
Flatten again, and flip so the seam side is up.
Roll out into a 3.5 inch (9 cm) circle using a rolling pin.
Cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 10 minutes. One by one, thin out the edges of the dough with your fingers, with the center thicker than the edges. The circle should be 4 inches (10 cm) in diameter.
Place the dough seam side up and put 1 to 1.5 Tbsp of curry paste in the center of the circle. Gather the opposing edges of the circle and fold the dough in half. Remember, KEEP THE CURRY OUT from the edges! It’s the most crucial part. If you didn’t read my post, read my tip #2 now in the post!
Tightly pinch the edges to seal well. If the edges are not pinched and pressed tightly, the seam might open up during proofing/deep frying.
Next, to double secure, fold the edges over to one side at least once, like folding a brown lunch bag. Press the edges again to secure.
Keeping the seam side on the bottom, put the bread back onto the silicone mat and cover with a damp towel while working on the rest of the dough.
Once all the dough has curry filling, crack the egg into a bowl and whisk well. Place the panko in a shallow bowl/tray. Using a pastry brush, coat the formed dough with egg and then panko.
Cover the bread with plastic wrap and let rise at 100ºF (38ºC) for 45-60 minutes or until 1.5 times its size (I used proof setting in my oven). If you touch the dough with your finger, the indentation will stay on the dough.
To deep fry the bread:
In a deep frying pot (I like using my 2.75QT Staub), heat the 4 cups (960 ml) oil to 320ºF (160ºC). Place 2-3 pieces of the curry bread into the oil, seam side down. After a few seconds, flip it around so the seam side is now up. You may need to hold it with a pair of tongs. Keep turning them while they deep fry, until they cook to a golden brown, about 2-3 minutes. Drain the oil well and transfer to the wire rack or some paper towels to drain while it cools. Serve hot or at room temperature.

Add the onion and garlic and cook until just softened (be careful not to burn the garlic). Add the spinach and cook, stirring often, until fully wilted, about 3 minutes.
Remove from the heat. Season lightly with salt and pepper and vigorously stir in the lemon juice and egg yolk (reserve the egg white for later). Transfer the mixture to a bowl and allow to cool.
Once the spinach is cool enough to handle, squeeze out as much liquid as possible and roughly chop. (I realize that it seems counter-intuitive to put liquid in then squeeze it out, but after countless test runs this process led to the best results.) Return spinach to the bowl and thoroughly mix in the feta.
Preheat the oven to 400°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Roll out the puff pastry to a rectangle about 1/8 inch thick and 12 by 18 inches. Cut into 6 even 5 to 6 inch squares. Put a spoonful of the spinach-feta mixture into the center of each puff pastry square. Fold the puff pastry over to form a triangle. Press down with a fork along the edges to tightly seal.
Transfer the turnovers to the prepared baking sheet. Brush with the reserved egg white and sprinkle with za’atar, if using. Put in the oven and bake for 20 minutes, or until golden brown.

Japanese Salted Salmon (Shiojake/Shiozake),Namiko Chen,https://www.justonecookbook.com/how-to-cook-salmon-salted-salmon/,Japanese,https://www.justonecookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Japanese-Salted-Salmon-1058-I-1.jpg,"['1.1 lb salmon fillets with skin', '1 Tbsp sake', '5 tsp kosher/sea salt (I use Diamond Crystal; Use half for table salt) ((25 g; 5% of salmon weight))']","Gather all the ingredients. Quickly rinse the salmon under cold water and pat dry with a paper towel. Slice the salmon diagonally if it’s not pre-sliced.
To Prepare Salmon
Evenly distribute sake on the salmon and coat well. Set aside for 10 minutes.
After 10 minutes, pat dry the salmon with a paper towel.
First, sprinkle and apply some kosher salt on the skin first.
Then sprinkle the remaining salt on both sides of the fillets. If you have leftover salt, use it on the skin.
Line the bottom of an air-tight container with a paper towel. This will absorb excess moisture from the fish.
Place the fillets in the container in a single layer and lay a sheet of paper towel on top of the fillets.
Then put the 2nd layer of the fillets on top of paper towel and lay another sheet of paper towel on top. Cover with lid and keep in the refrigerator for at least 2 days.
This is after 2 days. You will see moisture on the salmon skin.
Gently pat dry the fillets with a paper towel to get rid of any excess moisture.
To Store
If you don’t plan on cooking the salmon right away, after drying the fillets with a paper towel, wrap the individual pieces with plastic wrap and place them in a freezer bag to freeze. You can store the salmon in the freezer for up to 1 month. Remember to defrost completely before cooking.
To Broil (Recommended)
Preheat the broiler* with a rack placed about 6"" (15 cm) away from the top heating element (in the center of the oven) for 5 minutes. When broiling, you don't control the temperature in the oven; instead, you control the distance between the broiler and the surface of the food. It's similar to using hotter and cooler zones on your grill. *Broiler setting: Low (450ºF/232ºC), Medium (500ºF/260ºC), and High (550ºF/288ºC). I usually use medium or high.
Line a baking sheet with foil for easy cleaning. Place the salmon on the foil, skin side up (for crispy skin!). Broil the salmon at medium (500ºF) or high (550ºF) for 8-10 minutes. Please remember the cooking time varies depending on the thickness of the fish and the distance between the broiler and the food. Japanese salted salmon is cooked till well done (more dry and flaky). You do not need to flip it.
To Bake (Optional)
Preheat the oven to 425°F (218ºC) with a rack placed in the center and bake the salmon on parchment paper for 10-12 minutes. Japanese salted salmon is cooked till well done (more dry and flaky).",en-US,{},4.46,,Just One Cookbook,2910,4 serving(s)
Miso Soup,Namiko Chen,https://www.justonecookbook.com/homemade-miso-soup/,Japanese,https://www.justonecookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Homemade-miso-soup-6037-I-3.jpg,"['4 cups water', '1 piece kombu (dried kelp) ((⅓ oz, 10 g; 4"" x 4"" or 10 x 10 cm))', '1 cup katsuobushi (dried bonito flakes) ((packed; I used loose 3 cups in the video for strong dashi flavor))', '1 cup dashi (Japanese soup stock; click to learn more)', '1 Tbsp miso ((18 g))', 'Ingredients of your choice ((Please read the blog post))', 'green onion/scallion ((finely chopped))']","To Make Dashi (Can be Made in Advance):
Clean the kombu with a damp towel and soak the kombu in water for 30 minutes or overnight (preferred). NEVER wash kombu and do not remove the white substance -that’s umami! These days it's pretty clean, so you can skip this process. Just make sure there are no dirty particles.
After 30 minutes (or overnight), the kombu is rehydrated. This liquid is called cold brew Kombu Dashi.
Pour kombu dashi and kombu into a saucepan. SLOWLY bring to boil on medium-low heat so you can extract umami from kombu as much as possible. Right before the stock is boiling (it gets slimy and yields a bitter taste if you leave it), remove the kombu. Now what you have is Kombu Dashi. If you’re vegetarian/vegan, use this kombu dashi for your miso soup. What to do with used kombu? You can reuse it to make Simmered Kombu or Homemade Furikake Rice Seasoning.
If you're not vegetarian/vegan, add Katsuobushi and let it simmer for 30-60 seconds. Turn off the heat and let steep for 10 minutes.
Strain over a fine-mesh sieve and now you have roughly 4 cups of Awase Dashi. You can store in the refrigerator for up to 3-5 days and in the freezer for up to 2 weeks. Repurpose the used katsuobushi to make Homemade Furikake Rice Seasoning.
STEP 1 - Add Dashi
Here I demonstrate to make 2 cups/2 servings of miso soup. You can use the formula; 1 cup (200-240 ml) dashi + 1 Tbsp (18 g) miso = 1 serving miso soup. If you add more ingredients/vegetables, the amount of soup will increase and you will also need more miso. Add 2 cups (480 ml) dashi in the saucepan.
Are you in a hurry and no time to make dashi? You can use Dashi Packet or Dashi Powder to make instant dashi.
STEP 2 - Add dense ingredients BEFORE bringing dashi to a boil
If your miso soup doesn't include hard ingredients or clams, go to the next step. Add hard ingredients like root vegetables. Once boiling, lower the heat and simmer until they become tender. If you're making Clam Miso Soup, add clams in cold brew kombu dashi. Bring it to a gentle boil and once the shells are open, turn off the heat (do not overcook).
STEP 3- Add quick-cooking ingredients AFTER dashi is boiling
If your miso soup doesn’t include these ingredients, bring dashi to a boil and go to next step. AFTER dashi starts boiling, add in soft vegetables like leafy greens, mushrooms, deep-fried tofu pouch because they require less cooking time. At this point, keep the soup at a simmer and make sure it stays warm (not OVERBOILING).
STEP 4 - Add miso
Add a small amount of miso at a time (you can start with 2 Tbsp miso for 2 cups dashi). Put miso inside a ladle and slowly add dashi into the ladle to dissolve miso completely. You can buy a miso muddler or a fine-mesh miso strainer which helps you dissolve miso faster. If you accidentally added too much miso, dilute the miso soup with dashi (or water). NEVER OVERBOIL miso soup because it loses nutrients, flavors, and fragrance.
STEP 5 - Add tofu
Add tofu AFTER miso is completely dissolved because you might break the tofu when mixing in miso. If you add chilled tofu from the refrigerator, miso soup would get cooler. Reheat miso soup until it is just hot, but NOT BOIL.
STEP 6 - Add wakame & green onions
Add rehydrated wakame (seaweed). I recommend re-hydrating dried wakame in a separate bowl of water to get rid of saltiness, instead of re-hydrating inside miso soup. Add ingredients that do not require cooking such as chopped green onions, mitsuba, yuzu, and blanched spinach right before serving to keep the fresh fragrance and color.
To Serve:
Serve immediately. Place on the right side of the table setting (Read on Ichiju Sansai, or 1 soup 3 dishes; see the picture).
To Store:
In general, it's best to use up all the miso soup because the fragrance and taste will be lost as time passes by. Let your miso soup cool at room temperature (up to 4 hours - otherwise miso soup will be spoiled) and then refrigerate. You can keep for up to 2 days in the refrigerator. If you want to make a big batch, it's best to keep the soup BEFORE adding miso. Add the miso only for the portion you need. You can freeze miso soup for up to 2 weeks. If the miso soup contains potatoes or tofu, remove them before freezing as the textures subject to change.
To Reheat Miso Soup:
Bring miso soup in a pot over medium heat, but not to overboil. Miso loses its nutrients at high temperature.",en-US,{},4.71,,Just One Cookbook,55,4 serving(s)

To make dashi: In a measuring cup (or a large pot), add 4 cups water and kombu and let it steep. You can do this process overnight or as soon as you start preparing. This is kombu dashi. If you're using dashi powder or dashi packet, follow this tutorial, and use it at Step 12.
Cut the pork belly into 1 inch (2.5 cm) pieces.
Cut the leek in half lengthwise, and then cut the halves into 1-inch pieces widthwise. Rinse under cold water to make sure there is no dirt inside the pieces.
Cut the cabbage leaves into small pieces.
Remove the stem of shiitake mushrooms and slice thinly.
Cut the carrot in half lengthwise, and slice thinly. Cut the green onions thinly.
Transfer the kombu dashi into a pot (if you didn’t use a pot at Step 2). Slowly bring the kombu dashi to a boil over medium low heat. When the water is almost boiling, remove the kombu to avoid sliminess. If you are vegan/vegetarian, skip next two steps (Step 9 and Step 10).
Add 3 cups katsuobushi and cook for 15 seconds. Then turn off the heat and let the katsuobushi steep in the pot for 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, in a separate large pot (or donabe), heat 1 Tbsp sesame oil over medium heat. Once the pot is hot, add the pork belly and stir to cook.
Once the pork belly is 80% cooked through, add 1 Tbsp sake and stir to combine. Then add chopped leeks.
Once leeks are wilted, add the rest of the vegetables and mushrooms. Stir to coat with the oil. Then using a fine-mesh strainer, strain the dashi into the pot.
Bring the soup mixture to a boil, skimming the foam and scum on the surface while cooking. Turn off the heat and add 2 Tbsp miso first, and then gradually add in more as you taste the soup. Each miso brand and type of miso tastes differently and the sodium level varies, so you want to taste before adding more miso.
Add the tofu into the soup and turn on the heat to continue to simmer until tofu is nice and warm (tofu is edible chilled, so you don’t have to worry about “cooking” it). Just make sure not to let the miso soup boil. It should take not more than 3-4 minutes to warm the tofu, and the soup is now ready.
Before serving, scoop out a small portion of Yuzu Kosho from the jar and place it on a small plate. Grind 2 Tbsp sesame seeds and put in in a small bowl. Serve them alongside with the donabe or soup pot. After you ladle the soup into individual serving bowls, add a pinch of Yuzu Kosho, sprinkle sesame seeds, stir in and enjoy!

The consistency should be slightly thick but runny. Cover and refrigerate overnight.
While you are waiting for the pastry sheet to be thawed, wash fruits and drain well. Chop into small pieces if necessary.
After 2 pastry sheets are thawed, unfold them on a lightly floured surface. Using a round cookie cutter, cut the pastry sheet into 9 circles per sheet. Roll up the scrapes into a ball and re-roll them and cut into circles. I was able to make 24 circles with the 2 sheets.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Beat the egg and water in a small bowl.
Place half of the pastry circles (12 circles for me) onto a parchment paper lined baking sheet. Then put a small amount of fruits of your choice in the center. You can sprinkle a little bit of sugar if you like. I made half with sugar and half without sugar (fruits were pretty sweet already).
After you put all the fruits, brush the edges of the pastry circles with the egg wash using a pastry brush.
Put remaining pastry circles on top of the filling.
Press the edges of circles firmly to seal with a fork.
Using a kitchen knife, make 2 small slits on top of the pastry and brush the top of pastries with the egg wash using a pastry brush.
Bake for 15 minutes or until the pastries are nice golden brown on the top. Remove from the oven and let the pastries cool slightly.

Melon Pan,Namiko Chen,https://www.justonecookbook.com/melon-pan/,Japanese,https://www.justonecookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Melon-Pan.jpg,"['1 ¾ cup bread flour', '3 ½ Tbsp cake flour', '1 tsp kosher/sea salt (I use Diamond Crystal; Use half for table salt)', '3 Tbsp sugar', '1 ¼ tsp instant yeast ((see Notes if you use active dry yeast))', '1 large egg (50 g w/o shell) ((beaten))', '3 Tbsp whole milk', '3 Tbsp water ((3 Tbsp + 1 tsp to be precise; keep at 86ºF/30ºC))', '2 ½ Tbsp unsalted butter ((cut into small cubes and at room temp))', '4 Tbsp unsalted butter ((at room temp))', '½ cup sugar', '1 large egg (50 g w/o shell) ((beaten))', '1 ⅔ cup cake flour', '½ tsp baking powder', '2 Tbsp sugar']","Gather all the ingredients. I have 2 videos for this recipe: the hand-kneading method and the stand mixer method.
Step 1 - Making Main Dough
In a large bowl, combine 225 g (1 ¾ cup + 2 Tbsp) bread flour, 25 g (3 ½ Tbsp) cake flour, 40 g (3 Tbsp) granulated sugar, and 3 g (1 tsp) kosher salt.
Add 4 g (1 tsp) instant dry yeast and 1 large beaten egg to the bowl with dry ingredients.
Add 50 ml (3 ½ Tbsp) milk and 50 ml (3 ½ Tbsp) water, both at 86ºF (30ºC). Using a silicone spatula or your fingertips, gently mix the ingredients together until they are combined.
In the beginning, the dough is very sticky and wet, but keep mixing until it forms a loose, sticky ball. Also, use the dough to pick up the flour on the sides of the mixing bowl. This step should take about 2 minutes. Transfer the dough from the bowl to a lightly floured work surface.
Press the heels of your hands into the dough, pushing forward slightly. Fold the top half of the dough in half back toward you. Then rock forward on the lower part of your palm to press it flat.
Turn the dough slightly (to clockwise), fold it in half, and rock into it again with the lower part of your palm. This process is called ""punching"" the dough and the goal is to lengthen and stretch the gluten strands in the dough. Repeat for 5 minutes or so. Tip: If the dough doesn't seem to be losing its stickiness, sprinkle more flour over the top and work it into the dough. You can lightly dust your hands with flour to keep the dough from sticking too much.
After “punching” for 5 minutes and the dough gets more elastic, press and stretch the dough, about 10 inches (25 cm). Then put small cubes of 35 g (2 ½ Tbsp) unsalted butter on top of the dough. Roll up the dough tucking the butter in, and then continue the kneading process.
Your hands, dough, and the work surface will get oily and messy in the beginning. Don't’ be panic. I recommend using a metal/silicone dough scraper to collect the dough stuck on the work surface once in a while and keep kneading.
As you knead, the dough will absorb the butter and it will eventually become very smooth and easier to work with. Finally, start banging the dough onto the work surface and fold it over away from you. This helps develop the gluten (elasticity). Bang the dough, turn it 90 degrees, and “punch” it, using the lower part of your palm. Continue this process for 10 minutes or until the dough is smooth, supple, and silky. Tip: Don’t let go of the dough when you are banging onto the work surface and don’t let it rest for too long between turns.
When the dough gets silky and smooth, pull the end of your dough with your thumb and fingers. Keep spreading the dough with your fingers, stretching the dough into thin translucent membrane. This test is called Windowpane Test to see if the dough's gluten has been developed enough. If the dough tears, the gluten isn’t quite ready yet. Knead the dough for another 2 minutes and test again.
Shape the dough into a ball by pulling all sides of the ball to the bottom and pinching them together. Place the dough in a bowl (the seam on the bottom).
Cover the bowl with a plastic wrap and let the dough rise in a warm place until the dough has doubled in size, about 1-2 hours. I use a Proof setting (100ºF/38ºC) in my oven.
Step 2 - Making the Biscuit Dough
In a large bowl, add 60 g (About 4 Tbsp) unsalted butter and mix with the silicone spatula until it becomes smooth.
Add 100 g (½ cup) granulated sugar and mix with the silicone spatula until they blend well together.
Slowly add a very small amount of 1 large beaten egg (46-50 g/ml) into the bowl and blend well together before you add another small amount of the egg. Continue until all the egg is well blended.
Sift 200 g (1 ⅔ cup) cake flour and 2 g (½ tsp) baking powder into the mixture.
Using the silicone spatula, mix well until the dough is not floury. Collect the dough and make it into a ball.
Measure the weight of the biscuit dough. It should be around 400-410 g. Remember the weight as you’ll need it later (to measure ⅒ of the dough).
Roughly cut the dough into 10 pieces.
Starting from the big piece, measure the weight again till it weighs ⅒ of the total weight (in my case, 40-41 g). If it’s heavier, pinch off the dough and add the extra dough to a smaller dough, by stuffing the extra into the inside of the smaller dough.
Roll the 10 pieces of biscuit dough into 10 balls. Place them on a baking sheet lined with a silicone baking mat or baking sheet. Cover with plastic wrap and rest in the refrigerator for 10 minutes until it hardens a bit.
Step 1 - Making Main Dough
In a stand mixer bowl, combine 225 g (1 ¾ cup + 2 Tbsp) bread flour, 25 g (3 ½ Tbsp) cake flour, 40 g (3 Tbsp) granulated sugar, 3 g (1 tsp) kosher salt, and 4 g (1 tsp) instant dry yeast. Whisk all together.
Set your mixer with a dough hook attachment.
Add 1 large beaten egg and 50 ml (3 ½ Tbsp) milk and 50 ml (3 ½ Tbsp) water, both of which have been kept at 86ºF (30ºC), to the bowl with dry ingredients.
Start kneading on low speed (speed 2). Use a silicone spatula to scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl a couple of times.
Continue to knead until it clings to the hook and cleans the sides of the bowl.
Once the dough starts to come together, add the butter and continue to mix at low speed until the butter has been incorporated. Then increase speed to medium and knead until the dough is silky, smooth, and elastic.
When the dough gets silky and smooth, pull the end of your dough with your thumb and fingers. Keep spreading the dough with your fingers, stretching the dough into a thin translucent membrane. This test is called Windowpane Test to see if the dough's gluten has been developed enough. If the dough tears, the gluten isn’t quite ready yet. Knead the dough for another 2 minutes and test again.
Shape the dough into a ball by pulling all sides of the ball to the bottom and pinching them together. Place the dough in a bowl (the seam on the bottom).
Cover the bowl with a plastic wrap and let the dough rise in a warm place until the dough has doubled in size, about 1-2 hours. I use a Proof setting (100ºF/38ºC) in my oven.
Step 2 - Making the Biscuit Dough
In a clean stand mixer bowl, add 60 g (About 4 Tbsp) unsalted butter and 100 g (½ cup) granulated sugar.
Mix until well blended and smooth.
Slowly add a very small amount of 1 large beaten egg (46-50 g/ml) into the bowl and blend well together before you add another small amount of the egg. Continue until all the egg is well blended.
Sift 200 g (1 ½ cup + 2 Tbsp) cake flour and 2 g (½ tsp) baking powder into the mixture.
Mix until it’s incorporated and the dough is not floury. Then take out the dough and form it into a ball.
Measure the weight of the biscuit dough. It should be around 400-410 g. Remember the weight as you’ll need it later (to measure ⅒ of the dough).
Roughly cut the dough into 10 pieces.
Starting from the big piece, measure the weight again till it weighs ⅒ of the total weight (in my case, 40-41 g). If it’s heavier, pinch off the dough and add the extra dough to a smaller dough, by stuffing the extra into the inside of the smaller dough.
Roll the 10 pieces of biscuit dough into 10 balls. Place them on a baking sheet lined with silicone baking mat or baking sheet. Cover with plastic wrap and rest in the refrigerator for 10 minutes until it hardens a bit.
Step 3 - Shaping the Main Dough
Once the dough has doubled in size, dust your index finger with flour and put it in the center of the dough. If the hole doesn’t close, then the dough is ready for the next step.
Remove the dough with a silicone dough scraper and transfer to a lightly floured work surface. Press the dough with your hands to release gas in the dough and deflate.
Fold the dough in thirds and then fold in thirds again. Flip to keep the seam side on the bottom. Shape the dough into a ball. To close the seam line, rotate the dough (clockwise) with both hands while the seam line is touching the work surface.
Measure the weight of the main dough. It should be around 460-470 g. Remember the weight as you’ll need it later (to measure ⅒ of the dough).
Using a dough scraper, roughly cut the dough into 10 equal pieces. Starting from the big piece, measure the weight again till it weighs ⅒ of the total weight (in my case, 46-47 g).
If it’s heavier, pinch off the dough from the center and add the extra dough to a smaller dough, by stuffing the extra into the inside of the smaller dough. Knead to combine well. Shape each dough piece into a nice round ball, pulling from all the sides and tuck into the bottom. Place the dough on your left (right) palm, and rotate it with your right (left) hand, keeping the seam side on the bottom.
Put the dough on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. Cover the dough with plastic wrap (I use a portable cupcake holder lid) to prevent it from drying. Rest the dough for 15 minutes at room temperature.
Step 4 - Final Shaping
Put the biscuit dough on the lightly floured work surface and flatten the dough with your hand.
Using a rolling pin, roll out into 4 inch (10-12 cm) flat rounds. Continue the rest until the main dough is ready.
After 15 minutes of resting, flatten the main dough with your hand and fold in thirds.
Then fold in thirds one more time and pinch both ends to shape the dough into a ball.
Pull the dough from all sides towards the seam on the bottom. Place the dough on your left (right) palm, and rotate it with your right (left) hand a few times, keeping the seam side on the bottom.
Place the biscuit dough on your palm and put the main dough in the middle, seam side facing up.
Then flip to show the biscuit dough on top. Gently pull all sides of the biscuit dough wrapping around the main dough.
Coat the biscuit dough with granulated sugar (2 Tbsp) and remove the excess sugar. Then using a dough scraper or knife, gently score the biscuit dough into a crisscross pattern (I score 3 lines each side).
Place the dough on the baking sheet, seam side on the bottom. Cover the dough with plastic wrap to prevent from drying.
Let the dough rise in a warm place until the dough rises one and a half (1.5 x) in size, about 50 minutes (I used the Proof setting (100ºF/38ºC) in my oven).
When the dough has risen halfway, preheat the oven to 350ºF (180ºC). Note: If you are using the oven for proof, you have to transfer the dough to a warmer place so you can preheat the oven.
Step 5 - Baking
Bake at for 13-15 minutes. Toward the end of baking if you see the bread is not being browning evenly, rotate the bread once so that the bread gets an even color.
Once the bread is baked, transfer to a wire rack. Let it cool for 5 minutes, and enjoy!

Separate egg whites and egg yolks into two different bowls. Put the bowl with egg whites in the freezer for 15 minutes. Why do we freeze egg whites? Please read 3 Tips to Make Perfect Meringue (Egg Whites) in this post.
In the meantime, add milk and vanilla to the egg yolks and whisk until thick and frothy.
Sift the cake flour and baking powder into the bowl.
Whisk to combine thoroughly (but do not over-mix) and set aside.
After 15 minutes, take out the bowl with egg whites from the freezer. The egg whites should be half frozen. Now start beating egg whites.
When the egg whites turn frothy and pale white, gradually add in sugar (roughly ⅓ at a time). Continue to whip the egg whites.
The egg whites will become glossier and firmer. Stop beating when you lift up the hand mixer and the egg whites stand right up with stiff peaks slightly bending over.
Heat the large non-stick frying pan to 300ºF (150ºC) over the lowest heat. Brush with cooking oil and lightly remove any visible oil (otherwise the pancakes will have a spotty pattern). Keep the heat on while you combine egg whites and egg yolk mixture.
Take ⅓ of egg whites and add to the egg yolk mixture. Whisk together (don’t worry too much about breaking air bubbles at this step).
Next, take half of the egg whites and add to the egg yolk mixture. Using a whisk, gently fold in without breaking the air bubbles in the egg whites. Why do we use a whisk instead of a silicone spatula? Please read 3 Tips to Make Perfect Meringue (Egg Whites) in this post.
Now transfer the egg yolk mixture into egg whites. Carefully fold in two mixtures together without breaking the air bubbles. Make sure to gently mix the batter thoroughly!
For my stove and frying pan, I kept 300 ºF (150 ºC) all times on low heat. Remember each pancake gets roughly 4 scoops of batter, so that’s a total of 12 scoops for 3 pancakes. Now, scoop the batter and place on the frying pan. My recommendation is to use a small ladle (or a serving spoon that’s bigger than a regular spoon - probably 2-3 Tbsp) and make a tall pancake. Next, stack one more scoop to the first pancake. Then move on to the next two pancakes giving each 2 small scoops.
By the time all 3 pancakes have 2 scoops, the surface of the batter is slightly dry already, so you can stack one more scoop on top, keeping it up high. In the bowl, you should still have roughly 3 scoops left (if you have slightly more, that’s okay).
Set timer for 6-7 minutes, add 1 Tbsp water in 3 empty spaces inside the pan and cover with the lid. Water keeps the pancake moist. Please note: the suggested time is just a guideline and it’s based on the stove and frying pan that I'm using.
After 2 minutes passed, open the lid, and add one more scoop for each pancake (or more scoops if you have more batter). Make sure to stack high, not wide. If the water has evaporated, add a little bit more. Cover with lid and cook.
After 6-7 minutes passed, using the offset spatula, lift the pancake VERY GENTLY. If you feel the pancake is stuck, don’t touch until they firm up a little. If you force it, the pancake will crack in the middle. When the pancake is ready, you can easily move the pancake.
Here is another set of images to show the process. Slightly pull the pancake to create an empty space and gently flip over with “rolling over” motion.
Add water in empty spaces and set a timer for 4 to 5 minutes to cook the other side on the lowest heat.
Once they are nicely browned, transfer the pancakes to your serving plates.
Place fresh cream on the pancakes and top with berries. Dust the pancake with confectioners’ sugar and drizzle with maple syrup. Enjoy!
Fresh Whipped Cream
Prepare an ice bath by putting ice cubes and water in a large bowl and placing a clean and dry mixing bowl over. Add heavy cream and sugar to keep cool.
Whisk on high speed until medium to firm peaks form (should not be runny, but soft and fluffy firm whipped cream). Keep it chilled until you're ready to serve the pancakes.",en-US,{},4.54,,Just One Cookbook,45,3 serving(s)

Gather all the ingredients. This is for the Basic Avocado Toast. Toast a slice of Shokupan (Japanese pullman loaf bread).
Cut the avocado in half by running the knife around it. Twist.
If you are using only half an avocado, keep the one with seed for later. I use this avocado keeper to avoid oxidation. You can also squeeze lemon juice on the surface.
Smack the seed and remove it. Scoop the avocado flesh with a spoon.
Mash avocado with a fork and squeeze the lemon. Mix all together.
#1 Basic Avocado Toast
Transfer the mashed avocado onto a toasted shokupan. Press the avocado gently to evenly distribute with a fork. Season with freshly ground black pepper and flaked sea salt.
Drizzle sesame oil over the avocado. Serve immediately.
#2 Avocado Toast with Furikake

#3 Avocado Toast with Japanese Mayo or Spicy Mayo and Shichimi Togarashi
Instead of mashed avocado, you can serve with sliced avocado. Peel the avocado skin, and cut the avocado into ¼ inch slices.
Gently pressed to stagger and squeeze the lemon to coat the avocado with lemon juice.
Transfer the sliced avocado to a toasted shokupan, drizzle sesame oil over the avocado, and season with flake sea salt.
To make spicy mayo, mix Japanese mayo and sriracha sauce. If you don’t like spicy mayo, simply use just mayo. Drizzle Japanese mayo or spicy mayo on top of the avocado slices and sprinkle Shichimi Togarashi on top. Serve immediately.
#4 Avocado Toast with Ramen Egg
Transfer the mashed avocado onto a toasted shokupan. Press the avocado gently to evenly distribute with a fork. Drizzle sesame oil and season with flake sea salt.

You will also need a 12-inch non-stick frying pan (large enough to cook 3 pancakes at the same time) with a lid.
Make Fresh Whipped Cream
Prepare ice bath by putting ice cubes and water in a large bowl and placing a clean and dry mixing bowl over. Add heavy cream and sugar to keep cool.
Whisk on high speed until medium to firm peaks form. The whipped cream should not be runny, but soft and fluffy firm. Keep it chilled until you're ready to serve the pancakes.
Make Pancakes
Separate egg whites and egg yolks into two different bowls. Put the bowl with egg whites in the freezer for 15 minutes. Here's why (Read ""1. Chill egg whites (What?!)"").
In the meantime, add milk and vanilla to the egg yolks and whisk until thick and frothy.
Sift the cake flour and baking powder into the bowl. Because we add matcha powder, make sure to remove 1 tsp (3 g) cake flour after you measure ¼ cup.
Whisk to combine thoroughly (but do not over-mix) and set aside.
After 15 minutes, take out the bowl with egg whites from the freezer. The egg whites should be half frozen. Now start beating the egg whites.
When the egg whites turn frothy and pale white, gradually add in sugar. Continue to whip the egg whites.
The egg whites will become glossier and firmer. Stop beating when you lift up the hand mixer and the egg whites stand right up with soft peaks slightly bending over.
Heat the large non-stick frying pan to 300ºF (150ºC) over the lowest heat. Brush with cooking oil and lightly remove any visible oil (otherwise the pancakes will have a spotty pattern). Keep the heat on while you combine egg whites and egg yolk mixture.
Take 1/3 of egg whites and add into the egg yolk mixture. Whisk together (don’t worry too much about breaking air bubbles at this step).
Next, take half of the egg whites and add to the egg yolk mixture. Gently fold in without breaking the air bubbles in the egg whites.
Now transfer the egg yolk mixture into egg whites. Carefully fold in two mixtures together without breaking the air bubbles. Make sure to gently mix the batter thoroughly!
Remember each pancake gets roughly 4 scoops of batter, so that’s a total of 12 scoops for 3 pancakes. Now, scoop the batter and place on the frying pan.

The rice to water ratio is 1 : 1.1 (or 1.2 ). Please read the blog post for a detailed explanation.
To Rinse the Rice
Overfill the plastic rice cooker cup (180 ml) and level off. In this recipe, I'm using 3 rice cooker cups (540 ml).
Add water just enough till it submerges all the rice. Then discard the water immediately. Repeat this process 2-3 times. Tip: Rice absorbs water very quickly when you start rinsing, so don't let the rice absorb the first few rounds of water.
Use your fingers to gently wash the rice in a circular motion for 10-15 seconds. Repeat this process 1-2 times.
Add water and discard the water. Repeat this process 1-2 times.
Repeat this process 2 more times.
When the water is almost clear, drain well. Tip: Use a fine-mesh sieve to drain and shake off excess water.
Transfer the drained rice to the rice cooker (I use the Zojirushi IH). Add water (600 ml for my 3 rice cooker cups).
To Cook the Rice
Soak the rice for 20-30 minutes (especially if you're using an older rice cooker). Select your menu and press ""Start"". Tip: Even though my rice cooker includes soaking time, I soak my rice for 20-30 minutes. Note: For this Zojirushi rice cooker, 3-cup ""regular"" white rice takes 55 minutes to cook, which already includes a 10-minute soaking time and 10-minute steaming time in the program.
Once the rice is done cooking, let it steam for 10 minutes (if your rice cooker does not include the steaming time). Open the lid and fluff the rice with a rice paddle.
To Store Cooked Rice
Transfer the rice in airtight containers and close the lid to keep the moisture in. Let cool completely before storing the containers in the freezer (read my tutorial post).",en-US,{},4.55,,Just One Cookbook,60,2 serving(s)

Quickly rinse the salmon under cold water and pat dry with a paper towel. Slice the salmon diagonally if it’s not pre-sliced.
To Prepare Salmon
Evenly distribute sake on the salmon and coat well. Set aside for 10 minutes.
After 10 minutes, pat dry the salmon with a paper towel.
First, sprinkle and apply some kosher salt on the skin first.
Then sprinkle the remaining salt on both sides of the fillets. If you have leftover salt, use it on the skin.
Line the bottom of an air-tight container with a paper towel. This will absorb excess moisture from the fish.
Place the fillets in the container in a single layer and lay a sheet of paper towel on top of the fillets.
Then put the 2nd layer of the fillets on top of paper towel and lay another sheet of paper towel on top. Cover with lid and keep in the refrigerator for at least 2 days.
This is after 2 days. You will see moisture on the salmon skin.
Gently pat dry the fillets with a paper towel to get rid of any excess moisture.
To Store
If you don’t plan on cooking the salmon right away, after drying the fillets with a paper towel, wrap the individual pieces with plastic wrap and place them in a freezer bag to freeze. You can store the salmon in the freezer for up to 1 month. Remember to defrost completely before cooking.
To Broil (Recommended)
Preheat the broiler* with a rack placed about 6"" (15 cm) away from the top heating element (in the center of the oven) for 5 minutes. When broiling, you don't control the temperature in the oven; instead, you control the distance between the broiler and the surface of the food. It's similar to using hotter and cooler zones on your grill. *Broiler setting: Low (450ºF/232ºC), Medium (500ºF/260ºC), and High (550ºF/288ºC). I usually use medium or high.
Line a baking sheet with foil for easy cleaning. Place the salmon on the foil, skin side up (for crispy skin!). Broil the salmon at medium (500ºF) or high (550ºF) for 8-10 minutes. Please remember the cooking time varies depending on the thickness of the fish and the distance between the broiler and the food. Japanese salted salmon is cooked till well done (more dry and flaky). You do not need to flip it.
To Bake (Optional)

Leave the unsalted butter and Japanese curry at room temperature.
To make the dough:
In a large bowl, whisk together bread flour (150 g), cake flour (50 g), kosher salt (3 g), and sugar (15 g).
Microwave the milk (125 ml) until warm to the touch, about 95ºF/35ºC. Then add in the instant dry yeast (3 g) and the warm milk.
Using the silicone spatula, combine the wet and dry ingredients together until it becomes a rough dough. [1-2 minutes]
Once the dough becomes a ball, add the unsalted butter (10 g) in the center of the dough and combine well until the butter is incorporated into the dough. At first, the dough will be sticky, wet, and oily and you might want to add more flour, but wait and try kneading a little longer. [2-3 minutes]
Once you don’t see any big chunks of butter, transfer the dough from the bowl to a lightly floured surface. Knead the dough until it becomes smooth and pliable. Read the tip on kneading below. [5 minutes]
Tip on kneading: Using the lower part of your palm, push out the dough. Then roll back up as if you’re drawing the number “8” with your hand. Rotate the dough 90 degrees every time you finish drawing “8”.
After drawing “8” a few times, bang the dough onto the work surface and fold it over away from you. This helps develop gluten (elasticity). Turn the dough 90 degrees and repeat drawing “8” again. Continue this process until the dough is smooth, supple, and silky.
When the dough is moist, smooth, and pliable, form a ball. Place the seam side down on the working surface and twist the ball a few times to close the seam.
Place the dough back into the bowl, seam side down, cover with plastic wrap, and let rise at 100ºF (38ºC) for 60 minutes, or until doubled in size (I used proof setting in my oven).
Dust your finger with flour and poke the center of the dough. If the dough doesn’t close up, it’s ready.
Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and gently punch/press it down.
Fold the dough into thirds widthwise.
Fold the dough into thirds lengthwise.
Turn upside down so the seam is facing down. Twist the dough to form a nice ball shape.
Measure the weight of the dough on a kitchen scale and divide the number by 8. Roughly cut the dough into 8 pieces.
Weigh each piece of dough and cut off the extra dough if it weighs more than you calculated.
Add the extra dough to the smaller dough piece(s). Hide the extra dough in the center of the small dough by pulling the dough from the side.
Twist the dough to seal the seam on your hand. Place the 8 dough balls on the baking sheet lined with a silicone baking mat (or parchment paper). Cover with plastic wrap, and let rest for 15 minutes at room temperature.
To form the curry bread:
Place the dough seam side up and flatten out each piece with your hand. Fold in thirds widthwise.
Fold in thirds lengthwise, and then turn it upside down so the seam side is on the bottom.
Flatten again, and flip so the seam side is up.
Roll out into a 3.5 inch (9 cm) circle using a rolling pin.
Cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 10 minutes. One by one, thin out the edges of the dough with your fingers, with the center thicker than the edges. The circle should be 4 inches (10 cm) in diameter.
Place the dough seam side up and put 1 to 1.5 Tbsp of curry paste in the center of the circle. Gather the opposing edges of the circle and fold the dough in half. Remember, KEEP THE CURRY OUT from the edges! It’s the most crucial part. If you didn’t read my post, read my tip #2 now in the post!
Tightly pinch the edges to seal well. If the edges are not pinched and pressed tightly, the seam might open up during proofing/deep frying.
Next, to double secure, fold the edges over to one side at least once, like folding a brown lunch bag. Press the edges again to secure.
Keeping the seam side on the bottom, put the bread back onto the silicone mat and cover with a damp towel while working on the rest of the dough.
Once all the dough has curry filling, crack the egg into a bowl and whisk well. Place the panko in a shallow bowl/tray. Using a pastry brush, coat the formed dough with egg and then panko.
Cover the bread with plastic wrap and let rise at 100ºF (38ºC) for 45-60 minutes or until 1.5 times its size (I used proof setting in my oven). If you touch the dough with your finger, the indentation will stay on the dough.
To deep fry the bread:
In a deep frying pot (I like using my 2.75QT Staub), heat the 4 cups (960 ml) oil to 320ºF (160ºC). Place 2-3 pieces of the curry bread into the oil, seam side down. After a few seconds, flip it around so the seam side is now up. You may need to hold it with a pair of tongs. Keep turning them while they deep fry, until they cook to a golden brown, about 2-3 minutes. Drain the oil well and transfer to the wire rack or some paper towels to drain while it cools. Serve hot or at room temperature.

Then add 250 ml of water into the pot.
Cover the pot and bring to a boil over high heat.
When boiling, lower the heat to the stove’s lowest setting (make sure to use the right size of stove burner for your pot size). Open the lid and gently mix with the spoon once, making sure rice is not stuck to the bottom of the pot.
Cover the lid and simmer the rice for 30 minutes (Tip: With a good size pot and the lowest heat on the stove, the water should not boil over. If you cook with more water or your pot is smaller than my pot, you may want to cover the lid at a slight angle so the water doesn’t boil over). During this time, I never open the lid or mix the rice. (Tip: If you are worried, you can take a quick peek and make sure there’s enough water so the rice doesn’t burn the bottom of the pot. If necessary, you can stir the pot or add “hot” water. Otherwise, don’t touch the rice because you would end up breaking the nice shape of rice kernels.)

Clean the kombu with a damp towel and soak the kombu in water for 30 minutes or overnight (preferred). NEVER wash kombu and do not remove the white substance -that’s umami! These days it's pretty clean, so you can skip this process. Just make sure there are no dirty particles.
After 30 minutes (or overnight), the kombu is rehydrated. This liquid is called cold brew Kombu Dashi.
Pour kombu dashi and kombu into a saucepan. SLOWLY bring to boil on medium-low heat so you can extract umami from kombu as much as possible. Right before the stock is boiling (it gets slimy and yields a bitter taste if you leave it), remove the kombu. Now what you have is Kombu Dashi. If you’re vegetarian/vegan, use this kombu dashi for your miso soup. What to do with used kombu? You can reuse it to make Simmered Kombu or Homemade Furikake Rice Seasoning.
If you're not vegetarian/vegan, add Katsuobushi and let it simmer for 30-60 seconds. Turn off the heat and let steep for 10 minutes.
Strain over a fine-mesh sieve and now you have roughly 4 cups of Awase Dashi. You can store in the refrigerator for up to 3-5 days and in the freezer for up to 2 weeks. Repurpose the used katsuobushi to make Homemade Furikake Rice Seasoning.
STEP 1 - Add Dashi
Here I demonstrate to make 2 cups/2 servings of miso soup. You can use the formula; 1 cup (200-240 ml) dashi + 1 Tbsp (18 g) miso = 1 serving miso soup. If you add more ingredients/vegetables, the amount of soup will increase and you will also need more miso. Add 2 cups (480 ml) dashi in the saucepan.
Are you in a hurry and no time to make dashi? You can use Dashi Packet or Dashi Powder to make instant dashi.
STEP 2 - Add dense ingredients BEFORE bringing dashi to a boil
If your miso soup doesn't include hard ingredients or clams, go to the next step. Add hard ingredients like root vegetables. Once boiling, lower the heat and simmer until they become tender. If you're making Clam Miso Soup, add clams in cold brew kombu dashi. Bring it to a gentle boil and once the shells are open, turn off the heat (do not overcook).
STEP 3- Add quick-cooking ingredients AFTER dashi is boiling
If your miso soup doesn’t include these ingredients, bring dashi to a boil and go to next step. AFTER dashi starts boiling, add in soft vegetables like leafy greens, mushrooms, deep-fried tofu pouch because they require less cooking time. At this point, keep the soup at a simmer and make sure it stays warm (not OVERBOILING).
STEP 4 - Add miso
Add a small amount of miso at a time (you can start with 2 Tbsp miso for 2 cups dashi). Put miso inside a ladle and slowly add dashi into the ladle to dissolve miso completely. You can buy a miso muddler or a fine-mesh miso strainer which helps you dissolve miso faster. If you accidentally added too much miso, dilute the miso soup with dashi (or water). NEVER OVERBOIL miso soup because it loses nutrients, flavors, and fragrance.
STEP 5 - Add tofu
Add tofu AFTER miso is completely dissolved because you might break the tofu when mixing in miso. If you add chilled tofu from the refrigerator, miso soup would get cooler. Reheat miso soup until it is just hot, but NOT BOIL.
STEP 6 - Add wakame & green onions
Add rehydrated wakame (seaweed). I recommend re-hydrating dried wakame in a separate bowl of water to get rid of saltiness, instead of re-hydrating inside miso soup. Add ingredients that do not require cooking such as chopped green onions, mitsuba, yuzu, and blanched spinach right before serving to keep the fresh fragrance and color.
To Serve:
Serve immediately. Place on the right side of the table setting (Read on Ichiju Sansai, or 1 soup 3 dishes; see the picture).
To Store:
In general, it's best to use up all the miso soup because the fragrance and taste will be lost as time passes by. Let your miso soup cool at room temperature (up to 4 hours - otherwise miso soup will be spoiled) and then refrigerate. You can keep for up to 2 days in the refrigerator. If you want to make a big batch, it's best to keep the soup BEFORE adding miso. Add the miso only for the portion you need. You can freeze miso soup for up to 2 weeks. If the miso soup contains potatoes or tofu, remove them before freezing as the textures subject to change.
To Reheat Miso Soup:
Bring miso soup in a pot over medium heat, but not to overboil. Miso loses its nutrients at high temperature.",en-US,{},4.71,,Just One Cookbook,55,4 serving(s)

You will also need a 12-inch non-stick frying pan (large enough to cook 3 pancakes at the same time) with a lid.
Make Fresh Whipped Cream
Prepare ice bath by putting ice cubes and water in a large bowl and placing a clean and dry mixing bowl over. Add heavy cream and sugar to keep cool.
Whisk on high speed until medium to firm peaks form. The whipped cream should not be runny, but soft and fluffy firm. Keep it chilled until you're ready to serve the pancakes.
Make Pancakes
Separate egg whites and egg yolks into two different bowls. Put the bowl with egg whites in the freezer for 15 minutes. Here's why (Read ""1. Chill egg whites (What?!)"").
In the meantime, add milk and vanilla to the egg yolks and whisk until thick and frothy.
Sift the cake flour and baking powder into the bowl. Because we add matcha powder, make sure to remove 1 tsp (3 g) cake flour after you measure ¼ cup.
Whisk to combine thoroughly (but do not over-mix) and set aside.
After 15 minutes, take out the bowl with egg whites from the freezer. The egg whites should be half frozen. Now start beating the egg whites.
When the egg whites turn frothy and pale white, gradually add in sugar. Continue to whip the egg whites.
The egg whites will become glossier and firmer. Stop beating when you lift up the hand mixer and the egg whites stand right up with soft peaks slightly bending over.
Heat the large non-stick frying pan to 300ºF (150ºC) over the lowest heat. Brush with cooking oil and lightly remove any visible oil (otherwise the pancakes will have a spotty pattern). Keep the heat on while you combine egg whites and egg yolk mixture.
Take 1/3 of egg whites and add into the egg yolk mixture. Whisk together (don’t worry too much about breaking air bubbles at this step).
Next, take half of the egg whites and add to the egg yolk mixture. Gently fold in without breaking the air bubbles in the egg whites.
Now transfer the egg yolk mixture into egg whites. Carefully fold in two mixtures together without breaking the air bubbles. Make sure to gently mix the batter thoroughly!
Remember each pancake gets roughly 4 scoops of batter, so that’s a total of 12 scoops for 3 pancakes. Now, scoop the batter and place on the frying pan. My recommendation is to use a small ladle (or a serving spoon that’s bigger than a regular spoon) and make a tall pancake. Next, stack one more scoop to the first pancake. Then move on to the next two pancakes giving each 2 small scoops.
By the time all 3 pancakes have 2 scoops, the surface of the batter is slightly dry already, so you can stack one more scoop on top, keeping it up high. In the bowl, you should still have roughly 3 scoops left (if you have slightly more, that’s okay).
Set timer for 6-7 minutes, add 1 Tbsp water in 3 empty spaces inside the pan, and cover with the lid. Water keeps the pancake moist. Please note: the suggested time is just a guideline and it’s based on the stove and frying pan that I'm using.
After 2 minutes passed, open the lid, and add one more scoop for each pancake (or more scoops if you have more batter). Make sure to stack high, not wide. If the water has evaporated, add a little bit more. Cover with lid and cook.
After 6-7 minutes passed, using the offset spatula, lift the pancake VERY GENTLY. If you feel the pancake is stuck, don’t touch it until they firm up a little. If you force it, the pancake will crack in the middle. When the pancake is ready, you can easily move the pancake. Slightly pull the pancake to create an empty space and gently flip over with a “rolling over” motion.
Add water in empty spaces and set the timer for 4 to 5 minutes to cook the other side on the lowest heat.
Once they are nicely browned, transfer the pancakes to your serving plates. Place fresh cream on the pancakes and top with berries. Dust the pancake with confectioners’ sugar, a light sprinkling of matcha powder and drizzle with maple syrup. Enjoy!",en-US,{},4.44,,Just One Cookbook,30,3 serving(s)

The rice to water ratio is 1 : 1.1 (or 1.2 ). Please read the blog post for a detailed explanation.
To Rinse the Rice
Overfill the plastic rice cooker cup (180 ml) and level off. In this recipe, I'm using 3 rice cooker cups (540 ml).
Add water just enough till it submerges all the rice. Then discard the water immediately. Repeat this process 2-3 times. Tip: Rice absorbs water very quickly when you start rinsing, so don't let the rice absorb the first few rounds of water.
Use your fingers to gently wash the rice in a circular motion for 10-15 seconds. Repeat this process 1-2 times.
Add water and discard the water. Repeat this process 1-2 times.
Repeat this process 2 more times.
When the water is almost clear, drain well. Tip: Use a fine-mesh sieve to drain and shake off excess water.
Transfer the drained rice to the rice cooker (I use the Zojirushi IH). Add water (600 ml for my 3 rice cooker cups).
To Cook the Rice
Soak the rice for 20-30 minutes (especially if you're using an older rice cooker). Select your menu and press ""Start"". Tip: Even though my rice cooker includes soaking time, I soak my rice for 20-30 minutes. Note: For this Zojirushi rice cooker, 3-cup ""regular"" white rice takes 55 minutes to cook, which already includes a 10-minute soaking time and 10-minute steaming time in the program.
Once the rice is done cooking, let it steam for 10 minutes (if your rice cooker does not include the steaming time). Open the lid and fluff the rice with a rice paddle.
To Store Cooked Rice
Transfer the rice in airtight containers and close the lid to keep the moisture in. Let cool completely before storing the containers in the freezer (read my tutorial post).",en-US,{},4.55,,Just One Cookbook,60,2 serving(s)
Anpan,Namiko Chen,https://www.justonecookbook.com/anpan/,Japanese,https://www.justonecookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Anpan.jpg,"['2 cups bread flour', '3 ½ Tbsp cake flour', '¼ cup sugar', '1 tsp kosher/sea salt (I use Diamond Crystal; Use half for table salt)', '1 tsp instant yeast ((Are you using active dry yeast? See Notes))', '1 large egg (50 g w/o shell)', '3 Tbsp whole milk', '3 Tbsp water ((3 Tbsp + 1 tsp to be precise; keep at 86ºF/30ºC, See Notes))', '2 ½ Tbsp unsalted butter ((cut into small cubes))', '10 oz red bean paste (anko)', '1 large egg (50 g w/o shell)', '2 Tbsp water', '2 tsp toasted black sesame seeds']","Gather all the ingredients.
In a large bowl, combine bread flour (225 g; measure 2 cups and remove 2 Tbsp), cake flour (25 g; 3 ½ Tbsp), granulated sugar (50 g; ¼ cup), kosher salt (4 g; 1 tsp), and dry yeast (3 g; 1 tsp).
Beat 1 large egg in a small bowl and add to the bowl with dry ingredients.
Add milk (50 ml; 3 Tbsp + 1 tsp) and water (50 ml; 3 Tbsp + 1 tsp), both of which have been kept at 86ºF (30ºC).
Using your fingertips or a wooden spoon, gently mix the ingredients together until they are combined. In the beginning, the dough is very sticky and wet, but keep mixing until it forms a loose, sticky ball. Also, use the dough to pick up the flour on the sides of the mixing bowl. This step should take about 2 minutes.
Sprinkle a clean, stable surface with flour and transfer the dough from the bowl. Press the heels of your hands into the dough, pushing forward slightly. Fold the top half of the dough in half back toward you. Rock forward on the lower part of your palm to press it flat. Turn the dough slightly (to clockwise), fold it in half, and rock into it again with the lower part of your palm. This process is called ""punching"" the dough and the goal is to lengthen and stretch the gluten strands in the dough. Repeat for 5 minutes or so. Tip: If the dough doesn't seem to be losing its stickiness, sprinkle more flour over the top and work it into the dough. You can lightly dust your hands with flour to keep the dough from sticking too much.
After “punching” for 5 minutes and the dough gets more elastic, press and stretch the dough for 10 inches (25 cm). Then put small cubes of unsalted butter (35 g; 2 ½ Tbsp) unsalted butter on top of the dough. Roll up the dough tucking the butter in, and then continue the kneading process.
Your hands, dough, and the working surface will get oily and messy in the beginning. I recommend using a metal/silicone dough scraper to collect the dough stuck on the working surface.
As you knead, the dough will absorb the butter and it will eventually become very smooth and easier to work with.
When the dough becomes smooth, start banging the dough onto the counter and fold it over away from you. This helps develop the gluten (elasticity). Bang the dough, turn it 90 degrees, and “punch” it, using the lower part of your palm. Continue this process for 10 minutes or until the dough is smooth, supple, and silky. Tip: Don’t let go of the dough when you are banging onto the counter. Don’t let it rest for too long between turns.
Near the end, pull the end of your dough with your thumb and fingers. Keep spreading the dough with your fingers, stretching the dough into the thin translucent membrane. This test is called ""windowpane."" Test to see if the dough's gluten has been developed enough. Your dough is now ready to rise. If the dough tears, the gluten isn’t quite ready yet. Knead the dough for another 2 minutes and test again.
Shape the dough into a ball by pulling all sides of the ball to the bottom and pinching them together.
Place the dough in a bowl (the seam on the bottom) and cover with plastic wrap. Let the dough rise in a warm place until the dough has doubled in size, about 1-2 hours. I use a Proof setting (100ºF/38ºC) in my oven.
Once the dough has doubled in size, dust your index finger with flour and put it in the center of the dough. If the hole doesn’t close, then the dough is ready for next step.
Press the dough with your hands to release gas in the dough and deflate.
Fold both sides of the dough toward center.
Then fold in thirds toward the middle. Flip, keeping the seam side on the bottom.
Shape the dough into a ball, rotating (clockwise) with both hands while the seam line is touching the work surface.
Using a dough scraper cut the dough into 8 equal pieces. If you need to adjust the size of dough, pinch off the center of the big dough and add to the center of the small dough and knead to combine well.
Shape each dough piece into a nice round ball, pulling from all the sides and tuck into the bottom. Place the dough on your left (right) palm, and rotate it with your right (left) hand, keeping the seam side on the bottom.
Put the dough on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. Cover the dough with plastic wrap to prevent it from drying. Rest the dough for 15 minutes at room temperature.
After resting, flatten the dough with your hand, fold in thirds twice (just like you did earlier), and shape it into balls.
Press the dough so stretches to 3 inch (8 cm) diameter. Then put 35 g of red bean paste in the middle of the dough. Then pull all sides of the dough around and wrap the red bean paste tightly to seal.
Pinch the seam very well and put the seam on the bottom. Place the dough on your left (right) palm, and rotate it with your right (left) hand a few times, keeping the seam side on the bottom. Put the dough back into the baking sheet, seam side on the bottom.
Cover the dough with plastic wrap to prevent it from drying. Let the dough rise in a warm place until the dough has doubled in size, about 30 minutes (I used the Proof setting (100ºF/38ºC) in my oven). When the dough has risen halfway, preheat the oven to 400ºF (200ºC). For a convection oven, reduce cooking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC). Note: If you are using the oven for proof, you have to transfer the dough to a warmer place so you can preheat the oven.
In a small bowl, add 1 egg and 2 Tbsp water and whisk very well. Using a pastry brush, brush all sides of the dough with an egg wash.
Put 2 tsp black sesame seeds in a small bowl. Dip the flat round side of a rolling pin (about ¾ inch (1.9 cm) diameter) in the egg wash and black sesame seeds and stamp on top of the dough. Alternatively, you can simply sprinkle the black sesame seeds on top.
Bake at 400ºF (200ºC) for 13-15 minutes. Toward the end of baking if you see the bread is not being browning equally, rotate the bread once so that the bread gets equal color.
Once the bread is baked, transfer to a wire rack and let it cool. Serve warm or at room temperature immediately. Enjoy!

Preheat oven to 350ºF (180ºC). For a convection oven, reduce cooking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC). Lightly spray muffin tin with non-stick cooking spray or line with cupcake liners.
Sift flour and baking powder and cut bananas into thin slices.
To make the caramel, cook sugar and water over medium heat in a small saucepan. Gently tilt the pan off the heat to distribute color evenly as the sugar caramelizes.
When the mixture turns into nice amber color, immediately add sliced bananas and coat with caramel and turn off the heat.
In the bowl of the electric mixer, beat the butter on medium-high speed until soft. Then add sugar and mix until creamy and fluffy.
Whisk the eggs in a bowl, stir into the batter and blend well.
Add half of the flour to the batter and mix well. Then stir in half of the milk. Add the rest of flour and mix, and finally stir in the rest of milk. Mix well to combine.
Add vanilla extract and fold in the caramelized banana just until combined.
Spoon muffin batter into muffin tin ¾ full. If you like, top each muffin with ½ tsp of Nutella and use a skewer or chopstick to swirl it into the batter.
Bake muffins at 350ºF (180ºC) for about 25 minutes, or until a skewer insered in the center comes out clean. Serve warm or let cool completely for storage.

Gently whisk the eggs in a bowl. It's best to ""cut"" the eggs with chopsticks in a zig-zag motion and do not over mix.
In another bowl, combine the seasonings and mix well.
Pour the seasonings mixture into the egg mixture and whisk gently. Then pour the mixture into a measuring cup with spout and handle (so that it'll be easier to pour into the frying pan).
Tamagoyaki Pan Method
Heat the pan over medium heat, dip a folded paper towel in oil and apply to the pan. Put a little bit of egg mixture to see if the pan is hot.
When you hear the sizzling sound, pour a thin layer of egg mixture in the pan, tilting to cover the bottom of the pan.
Poke the air bubbles to release the air. After the bottom of the egg has set but still soft on top, start rolling into a log shape from one side to the other.
Move the rolled omelette to the side where you started to roll, and apply oil to the pan with a paper towel, even under the omelette.
Pour the egg mixture to cover the bottom of the pan again. Make sure to lift the omelette to spread the mixture underneath.
When the new layer of egg has set and still soft on top, start rolling from one side to the other.
Move the rolled omelette to the side where you started to roll, and apply oil to the pan with a paper towel, even under the omelette.
Pour the egg mixture to cover the bottom of the pan again. Make sure to lift the omelette to spread the mixture underneath.
When the new layer of egg has set and still soft on top, start rolling from one side to the other.
Now this is 3rd round. Poke the air bubbles...
The 4th round. Make sure to spread all over including under the rolled egg.
Continue rolling into the log. Tip: Control the temperature of the pan by lifting the frying pan rather than adjusting the stove heat. If the heat is too weak, the egg will stick to the frying pan so be careful.
This is the 5th round.
This is the 6th round and the final...
You can brown the omelette a little bit.
Remove from the pan and place the omelette on the bamboo sushi mat and wrap it up. Shape the egg when it is still hot. Let it stand for 5 minutes.
Round Frying Pan Method
