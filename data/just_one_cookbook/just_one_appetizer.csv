Chicken Spring Rolls,Namiko Chen,https://www.justonecookbook.com/chicken-spring-rolls/,Japanese,https://www.justonecookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Chicken-Spring-Rolls.jpg,"['½ lb boneless, skinless chicken breast', '1 tsp kosher/sea salt (I use Diamond Crystal; Use half for table salt)', ""2 Tbsp sake ((In Japan, we use sake to remove the unwanted odor of chicken. You can skip if you can't take alcohol.))"", '2 green onions/scallions', '1 knob ginger ((1"", 2.5 cm))', '1 carrot', '2 Persian/Japanese cucumbers ((or 1 English cucumber))', '5 butter lettuce leaves', '1 bunch cilantro (coriander)', '2 sprigs mint leaves', '10 rice paper wrappers', '2 Tbsp toasted white sesame seeds', '½ inch ginger', '1-2 clove garlic', '3 Tbsp sugar', '3 Tbsp soy sauce', '2 Tbsp rice vinegar', '2 tsp sesame oil (roasted)', '1 tsp la-yu (Japanese chili oil)']","Gather all the ingredients.
For the sauce, grind 2 Tbsp toasted sesame seeds in your mortar and pestle. Transfer the ground sesame seeds into a small bowl. Then grate the ½” ginger and 1-2 garlic cloves (I used a Microplane grater).
In a small bowl, whisk together 3 Tbsp sugar, 3 Tbsp soy sauce, 2 Tbsp rice vinegar, 2 tsp sesame oil, and 1 tsp la-yu and set aside.
Chop the scallions into 3 pieces. Slice 1” ginger into thin slices.
Butterfly the chicken breast. Butterflying is a really useful technique to create a uniform thickness throughout a piece of meat so that it will cook more quickly and evenly. First, remove the tender (small inner fillet) by cutting away any connective tissue. Turn the breast over and with the edge of a knife parallel to the cutting board, cut the length of the side of the breast. Carefully slice the breast in half widthwise almost to the other edge. Keep the edge intact and open the breast along the fold.
In a large pot, add water, 1 tsp salt, and 2 Tbsp sake that is enough to cover the chicken. Put sliced ginger and scallions and bring it to a boil. Once boiling, put the chicken (breast and tender) in the pot, reduce the heat to the lowest setting, and cover the lid. Cook the chicken for 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, juliene carrot and cucumber. I use a juliene slicer but if you don’t have one, cut into thin sheets first and then cut into matchstick size strips.
Take out the chicken from the pot onto a plate and immediately cover with the plastic wrap to prevent from drying. Once the chicken has cooled, shred the chicken into small pices with your hands.
Rinse the butter lettuce, mint, and cilantro under water and dry completely. Set all the ingredients on the working surface.
Pour hot water in a large bowl. Working with 1 wrapper at a time, soak the wrapper in the hot water and rotate 2-3 times, about 10 seconds. The wrapper will still feel slightly stiff but don’t worry, it will become softer. Place it flat on a working surface.
Lay the butter lettuce, chicken, carrot, and cucumber at the bottom ⅓ of the wrapper closest to you, and place the mint and cilantro leaves at the top ⅓ of the wrapper.
Pressing firmly down to hold the filling in place, fold the bottom of the wrapper and start rolling tightly.
Around the middle of the wrapper, fold both sides of the wrapper in and roll up tightly to the top. Place on a plate and cover loosely with plastic wrap and repeat with the remaining wrappers and fillings. Cut in half or in thirds, and serve with the Sesame Dipping Sauce.

Gyoza with Wings,Namiko Chen,https://www.justonecookbook.com/gyoza-with-wings-hanetsuki-gyoza/,Japanese,https://www.justonecookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Gyoza-with-Wings-w600.jpg,"['6-8 gyoza ((you can use 10-15 gyoza with this recipe))', '100 ml water ((To make 100 ml, take away 1 Tbsp from ½ cup))', '2 tsp flour', '1 Tbsp neutral-flavored oil (vegetable, canola, etc)', '2 tsp sesame oil (roasted)']","Gather ingredients. You can use homemade gyoza or store-bought gyoza for this recipe.
Combine 100 ml water and 2 tsp all-purpose flour.
Heat 1 Tbsp neutral flavor oil in a frying pan over medium to medium-high heat.
Cook the gyoza until the bottom is golden brown (more toward light golden brown).
Remove the hot frying pan from the heat and press on a damp cold towel for 3-5 seconds to cool the pan immediately.
Put the frying pan back to the heat. Whisk the flour mixture well one more time and pour the flour mixture into the pan. Cover the pan with a lid and cook on medium-low heat for 6-7 minutes.
If you have a glass lid, you can see the cooking process. If you don’t have a glass lid, check the amount of the liquid once in a while.
When gyoza is cooked through (skin is more see-through) and the flour mixture is almost evaporated, open the lid.
Since the gyoza is cooked already, all you need to do is to let the water evaporated. When the edges of the wings start to peel off from the pan (see right picture below), drizzle sesame oil around the edge of the wings. Adjust the heat according to the color of the wings. If it’s lighter, you can increase the heat slightly.
The sesame oil not only gives a delicious flavor, but also helps cook the flour mixture to make it crispy. Shake the pan a few times to detach the wings from the pan. You can use chopsticks to gently poke around the edges.
Put a plate over the gyoza and flip over. Tip: If you use a plate that’s smaller than a frying pan, you can gently press the gyoza so it doesn’t move around. It’s much easier to flip than using a larger plate. Be very careful as the oil might drip from the pan while you flip.
Serve the gyoza with wings with soy sauce. Optionally, you can add a tiny bit of rice vinegar or/and la-yu (Japanese chili oil).",en-US,{},4.34,,Just One Cookbook,15,1 serving(s)

Peel daikon and grate finely. Set aside in a small bowl.
Put some yuzu kosho and ponzu in a small serving bowl, and mix well.
On a serving platter, create 6 mounds of coarse sea salt for nesting each oyster.
To Grill
Preheat grill to high heat. Place the oysters on the heated grate with the cup sides facing down to hold in the juices. Cover and grill until oysters begin to open, about 4-5 minutes. Keep in mind the cooking time depends on the strength of grill and size of oysters.
Use tongs, transfer each opened oyster from the grill as soon as the shell pops open (even slightly open). Discard any oysters that do not open.
To open the oysters, place one oyster between a folded kitchen cloth. Open the shell, keeping the cup side down. Using a paring knife, cut the connected muscles between shells. Discard the top shell and remaining brine (it would be too salty to eat with ponzu). Pick out any fragments of the shell and place it on the platter. Repeat with the rest of oysters.
To Serve

Miso Dengaku Sauce
Combine 2 Tbsp sake, 2 Tbsp mirin, 2 Tbsp sugar, and 4 Tbsp miso in a saucepan. Mix well to combine and then bring to a gentle simmer over the lowest heat. Stir constantly and cook for 2-3 minutes. Make sure the miso doesn’t burn. When the miso has thickened, it’s ready to use. To Sore: You can put the miso in the airtight container and store the refrigerator for up to 3-4 weeks.
Use the miso glaze to slather on the foods you prepare below.
★ Tofu & Eggplant Dengaku
Preheat the oven to 400ºF (200ºC). For a convection oven, reduce cooking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC). Wrap the tofu with 2 sheets of paper towel and press the tofu between two plates for 30 minutes. Alternatively, you can microwave paper towel-wrapped tofu for 60-90 seconds to dehydrate. Once the tofu is dehydrated, cut it into small bite-size (any shape is ok), and the thickness should be about ¾ inch (1.5 cm).
Cut the eggplant in half lengthwise and score it in a crisscross pattern. This will help the eggplant absorb more flavors. Immediately soak in water to prevent the eggplants from changing colors, and to remove the bitter taste. Drain and dry with a paper towel.
Place the tofu and eggplants (skin side down) on a rimmed baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a silicone baking sheet. With a brush, apply vegetable oil on top and bottom of tofu and eggplants. Bake at 400ºF (200ºC) for 30 minutes, or until the eggplant is tender. Remove the baking sheet from the oven. Adjust the oven rack 6-inches from the heating element and preheat the broiler for 3 minutes. Meanwhile, carefully spoon some of the Miso Dengaku Sauce onto your tofu and eggplants and spread evenly. Broil for 3-4 minutes, or until the top has nice char and caramelization. Transfer to a serving platter, sprinkle with sesame seeds, and serve immediately.
★ Daikon Dengaku
Peel the daikon and cut it into ¾ inch (1.5-2 cm) rounds (you can cut into half-moon shape if daikon is too big). Make a crisscross incision in the center (just one side – this will be the bottom side when serving), which helps absorb the seasonings. We call this technique “Kakushi Bocho”.
Place the daikon in the pan and cover with water. Ideally, instead of water, you want to use the rice-soaked water (the first white water that you throw away while washing rice). It’ll help daikon keep the pretty white color. Now bring to boil over high heat. Once boiling, cook on low heat for 20 minutes.
Drain the rice soaked water and put the daikon back in the pot. Cover the daikon with water, put the kombu, and bring to a boil. Right before boiling, remove and discard the kombu. Lower the heat to simmer and cook daikon for another 20 minutes, or until a skewer pierces through smoothly. Turn off the heat and transfer to a serving dish. Pour a generous amount of Dengaku Miso and sprinkle sesame seeds on top. Serve warm.
★ Konnyaku Dengaku
Cut the konnyaku into bite-size pieces and gently score each piece with a crisscross pattern on the top.
Bring water in a medium saucepan to boil and cook konnyaku for 3 minutes. Drain and allow to cool a little bit before stringing onto bamboo skewers. Slather a generous amount of Dengaku Miso on top and serve immediately.

Pound the chicken breast to an equal thickness.
Put the chicken breast in a large bowl and add all the marinade ingredients to the bowl. Rub the chicken with the marinade and set aside for 15 minutes.
Using a julienne slicer, cut carrot and daikon into matchstick sized strips. If you don’t have a julienne slicer, cut into thin sheets first, then cut into matchstick sized strips.
Coarsely chop the peanuts with a knife or grind them in a mortar and pestle. Put the Thai chili sauce and chopped cilantro in a small dish.
Heat the oil in a large grill pan (or regular frying pan). When the pan is hot, place the chicken into the pan without adding marinade (To brown the meat nicely, we do not add any liquid). Cover and cook the chicken on medium-high heat for 2-3 minutes, until golden brown on the bottom.
Flip and cover to cook for another 2-3 minutes till the meat is cooked through. If the meat is browning too fast, lower the heat.
Take out the chicken and cut into small cubes.

To Prepare Ingredients
Pull off the head if it is still attached. Pull off the outer shell. Devein the back of shrimp with a skewer. The vein runs right along the back. Insert the tip of skewer sideways about ½ inch down from the head of the shrimp and pull the skewer tip up towards you. This will lift up the vein and you can pull off the vein with the skewer or with your hand. If the vein is broken, then insert again a bit lower towards the tail. If you can’t find the vein, then don’t worry about it. [Recommended] Clean the shrimp with a pinch of salt, 1 Tbsp potato/corn starch, and 2 Tbsp water in a bowl and rub until you see dirty water. Rinse until clean.
Cut the tip of the tail diagonally (as you see below).
Remove dirty water in the tail by holding the tip of the knife down on the tail and moving it from left to right squeezing the water out from the cut tip. If you skip this process, water retained in the tail might create splatter in the oil.
Now all the tail is almost translucent.
Make a couple of slits diagonally underside of the shrimp.
Hold the shrimp with both hands and straighten it as much as possible in order to get the desired shape.
In a small bowl, put the shrimp, sake, and salt and mix well together. Let it marinate until you’re ready to use them.
Peel the ginger skin and cut it into julienned strips.
Cut the negi diagonally into thin slices.
Cut the egg roll wrappers in half and peel off one egg roll at a time to separate them (now you have 10 wrappers!).
Prepare the flour mixture by mixing flour and water in a small bowl. Put the Negi Miso in a small bowl.
To Wrap
Place an egg roll wrapper in front of you with one point of the long side of the wrapper towards you. Place the Negi Miso and shrimp (tail sticking out ½ of the way onto the wrapper on the long side.
Put julienned ginger and negi on the shrimp. Fold bottom edge of the wrapper over the shrimp.
Fold the side edge over to meet the shrimp, and begin to roll.
Continue rolling until you meet the end of the wrapper. Place a small dollop of the flour mixture on the edge of the wrapper. Repeat wrapping until all shrimp and wraps are done.
To Deep Fry
In a large frying pan or medium saucepan, place ½ inch of oil. Heat on medium heat until hot and begins to have tiny bubbles when a chopstick tip is placed in the oil.
Slowly place egg rolls in the pan. Do not crowd. Cover with the splatter guard if you have one. Cook until golden brown and shrimp is fully cooked. About 3 minutes on each side.

In a saucepan, combine the sauce ingredients and mix it all together. Bring it to a boil and turn off the heat (keep it covered so the sauce doesn’t evaporate).
In a deep frying pot/saucepan, add the deep-frying oil and bring it to 320ºF (160ºC).
Check if the oil has reached at 320ºF (160ºC) by putting the wooden chopsticks into the oil. If you see the small bubbles coming from the chopsticks, the oil is ready.
While waiting for the oil, we prepare the eggplant. Usually, eggplant is soaked in water to prevent discoloration. For this recipe, however, we avoid soaking in water because we will need to deep fry it without coating. You must cut the eggplant right before deep-frying to avoid changing color. Discard the tops of the eggplant and cut in half lengthwise.
Make incisions on the eggplant diagonally (or cut in a crisscross pattern). Do not cut through, and the intervals should be ⅛ inch (3 mm).
Cut each eggplant into 3-4 sections. Make sure to wipe off any moisture with paper towel.
Gently put a few pieces of eggplant, skin facing down, and deep fry for 2 to 2.5 minutes. If you put too many pieces of (cold) eggplant in the oil, the oil temperature will decrease too fast and it gets mushy and greasy. So do not overcrowd the pot. If you realize the oil temperature is too low, take out the eggplant and wait till the oil reaches the right temperature. Remove from the oil and drain on a wire rack, skin facing up. Deep fry the next batch, until all the eggplant pieces are deep-fried.
When the eggplants are cooled, transfer to a rimmed container or dish. Heat up the sauce until hot and then pour the hot sauce over to soak the eggplant for several hours (at least 1 hour). If you serve this dish chilled, put it in the refrigerator.
While soaking, peel the skin of daikon and grate.
Cut green onion and grate ginger.
To Serve
Put the eggplant in a serving dish and sprinkle some katsuobushi. Put grated daikon and grated ginger on top. Pour the sauce over and garnish with green onion. Serve chilled or at room temperature.

Grate ¼ apple, ½ clove garlic, and ½ knob ginger.
Add the grated apple, garlic, and ginger into the sauce and mix all together.
Place the meat in a single layer and drizzle some of the sauce on top. The sauce does not have to cover the entire meat. In Japanese BBQ restaurants, they usually just drizzle a small amount to the meat.
Peel the carrot. Use a julienne peeler or a knife to cut the carrot into julienned strips.
Cut the cucumber diagonally into thin slices and then cut them into thin strips.
Cut off the green part of the green onions and we will only use the white part. Cut the white part in half lengthwise and thinly slice into long strips. Soak in iced water to make them crisp and curl.
Heat the griddle or frying pan or outdoor grill and brush the oil on the griddle. When it’s hot, start cooking the meat. Once you get nice char on one side, flip and cook the other side. Cooking time varies depends on the meat and its thickness. Set aside.
Once all the food is prepared, pour hot water into a large bowl. Working with 1 wrapper at a time, soak the wrapper in the hot water and rotate 2-3 times, about 5 seconds. The wrapper will still feel slightly stiff but don’t worry, it will become softer. Place it flat on a plate.

Grate ginger, measure 1 tsp of grated ginger, and save all the ginger juice for later use.
Place the chicken wings in a large bowl and crush 2 garlic cloves with a garlic press (or mince the garlic). Add 1 tsp grated ginger and ¼ cup sake.
Add ⅛ tsp kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper.
Rub the chicken wings well with your hands until they’re completely coated in the mix.
Heat the Dutch oven (I use this 4.5 Le Creuset) over medium heat. Once it’s hot, add 1 Tbsp sesame oil and distribute evenly. Add the chicken wings in a single layer, trying not to overwrap. If you cook more than 2 lbs chicken wings, you will definitely need to cook in batches.
Some parts of chicken wings may get overlapped, but that’s okay. Cover and cook on medium heat for 4-5 minutes.
After 4-5 minutes have passed, open the lid and flip the chicken wings. Now, if you are using a pot that is NOT oven-safe, then you want to brown the chicken wings nicely at this stage. Don’t turn the wings often and let the wings get nice brown char. You may need to increase the heat slightly, depending on the pot you’re using.
Cover again and cook for another 4-5 minutes. Then uncover and check if the wings need to brown more.
Add 2 Tbsp honey, 2 Tbsp brown sugar, ¼ cup sake, ¼ cup mirin, and ¼ cup soy sauce.
Lastly add all the ginger juice (roughly 1 tsp) and make sure all the wings are coated in the sauce very well.
Lower the heat and simmer for 15 minutes, until the sauce is reduced and most of the chicken wings are exposed from the sauce. When you’re about to finish simmering, preheat the broiler for 5 minutes.
Place the Dutch oven in the oven and broil for 3-4 minutes. Stay in front of the oven to make sure you don’t burn the chicken wings. My rack is in the middle and heat element is not too close to the chicken wings. Broiling time varies depending on how far your wings are from the heat element.

Soak the kombu in 5 cups (1.2 L) of water for 30 minutes. Reserve this kombu water (aka Kombu Dashi), yielding roughly 4 cups, as we will be using it for cooking later.
Soak kanpyo in water for 15 minutes and drain. Quickly rinse kanpyo under running water and rub it with 1 tsp kosher salt. Rinse again and drain well.
In a flat container, add 2 cups (480 ml) of water and 1 tsp kosher salt. Place the salmon fillets and set aside for 30 minutes to de-salt the salmon.
Remove the salmon from the salted water and gently pat dry with a paper towel.
Using a sharp knife, remove bones off the salmon (if there is any on your fillet).
If you have kitchen tweezers, they help remove the bones from the flesh very easily. Finally, remove the skin.
Cut the salmon fillets into a roughly 3.5” x ¾” log shape (or any shape that is easy to roll up in the kombu). The width of the salmon should match the width of the kombu.
Wipe off the excess moisture on the kombu with a paper towel.
Wrap the log-shaped salmon with kombu. Pull up the other end of kombu a few times as you roll tightly.
Once all the kombu is rolled up, tie each one with kanpyo. Depends on the width of the kombu, you might need to make 1 to 3 ties. Think about the final serving size and decide on the location of the knots. Here each kombu makes 2 salmon kombu roll pieces as I would be cutting each roll in half. Therefore, I’d need 2 ties/knots.
Place the kombu roll in a large pot (I use Le Creuset 3.5 QT). Add the reserved kombu dashi until kombu is fully submerged, roughly 3 cups. You don’t have to use all of the kombu dashi, but save it just in case you need to add more liquid later.
Add sake and rice vinegar.
Place the Otoshibuta (drop lid - see how we can make it with aluminum foil) on the salmon kombu roll. We do not use a regular lid throughout the cooking process. Once boiling, skim off the foam and scum on the surface. Then cook on a gentle simmer for 1 hour. If the cooking liquid evaporates too fast, add the reserved Kombu Dashi (I did not need to).
Insert a wooden skewer to check if the kombu has become tender.
Once it’s tender, add sugar and half of the soy sauce (1 ½ Tbsp).
Instead of using utensils (that can potentially break down the kombu), hold the pot and swirl it around to mix the seasonings and coat with the food. Cook covered (with otoshibuta) on simmer for 15 minutes.
Add mirin and the rest of soy sauce (1 ½ Tbsp) and cook covered with the otoshibuta on simmer for another 10 minutes, or until the cooking liquid is almost gone. Once it’s done cooking, remove from the heat and let cool.
Once cool enough to handle, cut the kombu in half (if you have 2 ties). If you like, cut off both ends for a better presentation.

Stack two slices of ham and season with freshly ground black pepper.
This is an optional step. To increase the fluffy and crispy texture of panko, spray some water on panko and fluff it up with hands.
Dip the ham into the flour, then shake off the excess. Next, run the ham through the egg to coat it on both sides.
Finally, lay the ham in the panko, turn it over and gently press it into the breading to coat. When you deep fry, panko will become fluffy again so don’t worry about pressing it.
Add the oil in a heavy-bottom pot and heat the oil to 340ºF (170ºC). You will at least need 1 inch of oil. You can check the temperature by inserting wooden chopsticks. When small bubbles appear around the chopsticks, the oil is ready. Or throw a piece of panko into the oil. If the panko immediately comes right back to the surface, oil is ready. Read more on How To Deep Fry Food.
Gently drop the panko-coated ham in the oil and deep fry for 1 minute on the bottom side. Try to maintain the oil temperature by adjusting the heat. If you’re new to deep frying, a deep-fry thermometer is helpful.
Once the bottom side is a nice golden brown, flip and cook for about 45 seconds on the other side. Drain the excess oil and remove from the pot.
Transfer to the wire rack or plate lined with a paper towel. Before you start the next batch, always pick up the crumbs in the oil (they will darken the oil)

To Wrap Gyoza and Store
Wrap the filling with gyoza wrappers (See How To Wrap Gyoza). If you don’t cook the gyoza right away, I recommend freezing because moisture from the filling may break the wrapping. To freeze, place the gyoza on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, keeping some distance to each other, and flash-freeze until hard (so now gyoza won't stick to each other). Then transfer to a freezer bag to store.
To Cook Gyoza
In a large non-stick frying pan, heat oil on medium high heat. When the pan is hot, arrange gyoza in a circular shape. If you place gyoza tightly together, the individual pieces won’t fall off when you flip them onto a serving plate.
When gyoza is browned, pour water and immediately put the lid on. Turn the heat to high and steam gyoza till most of water evaporates. Be careful not to overcook gyoza because it will burn easily.
When most of the water is evaporated, remove the lid to let any remaining water evaporate. Add sesame oil around the edge of the inner pan and cook uncovered until gyoza gets nice and crisp on the bottom.

Grate ginger, measure 1 tsp of grated ginger, and save all the ginger juice for later use.
Place the chicken wings in a large bowl and crush 2 garlic cloves with a garlic press (or mince the garlic). Add 1 tsp grated ginger and ¼ cup sake.
Add ⅛ tsp kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper.
Rub the chicken wings well with your hands until they’re completely coated in the mix.
Heat the Dutch oven (I use this 4.5 Le Creuset) over medium heat. Once it’s hot, add 1 Tbsp sesame oil and distribute evenly. Add the chicken wings in a single layer, trying not to overwrap. If you cook more than 2 lbs chicken wings, you will definitely need to cook in batches.
Some parts of chicken wings may get overlapped, but that’s okay. Cover and cook on medium heat for 4-5 minutes.
After 4-5 minutes have passed, open the lid and flip the chicken wings. Now, if you are using a pot that is NOT oven-safe, then you want to brown the chicken wings nicely at this stage. Don’t turn the wings often and let the wings get nice brown char. You may need to increase the heat slightly, depending on the pot you’re using.
Cover again and cook for another 4-5 minutes. Then uncover and check if the wings need to brown more.
Add 2 Tbsp honey, 2 Tbsp brown sugar, ¼ cup sake, ¼ cup mirin, and ¼ cup soy sauce.
Lastly add all the ginger juice (roughly 1 tsp) and make sure all the wings are coated in the sauce very well.
Lower the heat and simmer for 15 minutes, until the sauce is reduced and most of the chicken wings are exposed from the sauce. When you’re about to finish simmering, preheat the broiler for 5 minutes.
Place the Dutch oven in the oven and broil for 3-4 minutes. Stay in front of the oven to make sure you don’t burn the chicken wings. My rack is in the middle and heat element is not too close to the chicken wings. Broiling time varies depending on how far your wings are from the heat element.

In a small bowl, put 2 dried shiitake and 3 Tbsp water and rehydrate for 15 minutes. When shiitake becomes soft, squeeze water out and slice them thinly. Tip: This liquid is Shiitake Dashi. If you want to use this Shiitake Dashi as a part of your dashi in this recipe, remove 2 Tbsp from ½ cup dashi, and replace with 2 Tbsp Shiitake Dashi.
Cut chicken into small cubes so that they will be cooked fast. Marinate the chicken and shrimp in sake for 15 minutes (sake will get rid of unwanted smell).
Whisk the egg in a medium bowl. Add seasonings and ½ cup dashi. Mix well.
Then strain the mixture through a sieve into another bowl.

Gather all the ingredients. Make the standard awase dashi if you haven't prepared it yet and let it cool to room temperature (you can place the pot with dashi in it over a bowl of iced water).
Cut the chicken thigh into slanted, smaller bite-sized pieces. I use “sogigiri” Japanese cutting technique to create more surface so it will cook faster.
Put chicken pieces and shrimp each in a bowl and add 1 Tbsp sake to each bowl. This is to remove any unwanted smell from the chicken and shrimp.
Cut the carrot into ¼ inch slices. The next step is optional, but you can cut out the carrot slice into a flower shape by using a vegetable cutter or use ""nejiri ume"" Japanese cutting technique.
Make a knot at the stem of mitsuba.
Cut and discard the bottom end of shimeji mushrooms and slice kamaboko fish cake into thin slices.
To Prepare Egg Mixture
It’s best to use a kitchen scale but if you don’t have one, use a liquid measuring cup. Crack eggs in a large bowl on a kitchen scale (or in the liquid measuring cup). My 3 eggs are 153 grams or 153 ml. You will need to multiply that number by 2.5 (Read the blog post on why we multiply by 2.5). 153 x 2.5= 382. Prepare 382 grams (or ml) dashi.
Transfer the eggs into a large bowl that can fit dashi and seasonings and whisk the eggs.
Add dashi (382 ml), 1 tsp mirin, 1 tsp usukuchi soy sauce (or regular soy sauce), and ½ tsp kosher salt. Whisk all together.
Pass the egg mixture through a strainer/sieve into a liquid measuring cup (for easy pouring later on).
To Assemble
Place the ingredients in each chawanmushi cup or ramekin. You want to show the colorful ingredients on top, so put the non-colorful ingredients like chicken on the bottom. Put more colorful or unique shape ingredients toward the top.
Evenly distribute the egg mixture into chawanmushi cups. Place the mitsuba on top.
Cover the chawanmushi cups with lids or wrap with a sheet of aluminum foil (if you are going to stack one on top of another).
To Steam in Instant Pot
Fill the instant pot with 1 cup water. Set the steamer rack in place.
Put the chawanmushi cups inside. The 5th chawanmushi cup goes on top of the 4 cups.
Close the lid and click STEAM, make sure it’s LOW pressure and set the timer for zero (0) minute.
It will take about 10 minutes to reach the optimal pressure. Then beep for 0 minute. Then it will naturally release. Set your own timer for 10 minutes natural release.
At 10 minutes alarm, open the lid and take out one chawanmushi cup and go to the next step. If the lid doesn’t open, then it means the pressure hasn’t fully released yet. Prepare a kitchen towel and turn the nozzle to release pressure. Only a little bit of steam should be left, so don’t be scared. Once the pressure has released, you can open the lid.
Open the chawanmushi cup lid (or aluminum foil) and insert a skewer to see if the egg custard is fully cooked. If the custard look set and there is no liquid coming out, it is fully cooked.
If the chawanmushi is not fully cooked yet (most likely your container is bigger than my chawanmushi cups OR you must have used a colder egg mixture or ingredients), repeat the steam process, and release the air pressure manually. Remember, the egg mixture will continue to cook through from pre- and after- pressure cooking time.

In a saucepan, combine the sauce ingredients and mix it all together. Bring it to a boil and turn off the heat (keep it covered so the sauce doesn’t evaporate).
In a deep frying pot/saucepan, add the deep-frying oil and bring it to 320ºF (160ºC).
Check if the oil has reached at 320ºF (160ºC) by putting the wooden chopsticks into the oil. If you see the small bubbles coming from the chopsticks, the oil is ready.
While waiting for the oil, we prepare the eggplant. Usually, eggplant is soaked in water to prevent discoloration. For this recipe, however, we avoid soaking in water because we will need to deep fry it without coating. You must cut the eggplant right before deep-frying to avoid changing color. Discard the tops of the eggplant and cut in half lengthwise.
Make incisions on the eggplant diagonally (or cut in a crisscross pattern). Do not cut through, and the intervals should be ⅛ inch (3 mm).
Cut each eggplant into 3-4 sections. Make sure to wipe off any moisture with paper towel.
Gently put a few pieces of eggplant, skin facing down, and deep fry for 2 to 2.5 minutes. If you put too many pieces of (cold) eggplant in the oil, the oil temperature will decrease too fast and it gets mushy and greasy. So do not overcrowd the pot. If you realize the oil temperature is too low, take out the eggplant and wait till the oil reaches the right temperature. Remove from the oil and drain on a wire rack, skin facing up. Deep fry the next batch, until all the eggplant pieces are deep-fried.
When the eggplants are cooled, transfer to a rimmed container or dish. Heat up the sauce until hot and then pour the hot sauce over to soak the eggplant for several hours (at least 1 hour). If you serve this dish chilled, put it in the refrigerator.
While soaking, peel the skin of daikon and grate.

You will also need parchment paper and a bamboo sushi mat. In Japan, we use a special bamboo mat with thicker bamboo strips called Oni-Sudare, which givesbig ridges/indentations to datemaki.

Pound the pork on both sides with a meat pounder (or the back of the knife).
Then mold the meat back into the original shape with your hands, and then cut into 2 inch pieces.
Heat oil on the heavy skillet over medium high heat and put the fattiest part on the bottom. Cook the meat until all sides are nicely browned. To prevent from oil splatter, you can use a splatter screen.
When the meat is nicely browned, transfer it to paper towel and wipe off excess fat.
Slice the ginger and cut the green part of Tokyo Negi into 2-inch pieces. Save two slices for later.
With the white part of Tokyo Negi, make Shiraga Negi for garnish (See How To Make Shiraga Negi).
In a large pot, put the seared pork belly, green part of the Negi, half of the sliced ginger (save the half for later), and pour water to cover the meat.
Bring it to a boil and then reduce heat to simmer. Cook uncovered (so unwanted smell goes away) for 2-3 hours, turning occasionally (if you want really tender meat, cook for at least 3 hours). When the liquid is running low, keep adding water (or hot water) to cover the meat.
Meanwhile make 3 hard-boiled eggs (How To Make Perfect Hard Boiled Eggs).
After cooking for 2 hours, drain and take out the meat and wipe off excess oil with paper towel.
In another large pot (I use a cast iron pot), add the pork belly, dashi, sake, and mirin. Start cooking on medium-high heat.
Add sugar, soy sauce, the rest of ginger slices, and the red chili pepper (I remove the seeds for my kids.).
When boiling, lower the heat but keep simmering. Place Otoshibuta on top (If you don't have an Otoshibuta, make one! See How To Make Otoshibuta) and do not need to put a regular lid. We’ll be cooking for 1 hour on simmer/low heat.
After cooking for 30 minutes, add the hard-boiled eggs. Remove otoshibuta and continue simmering.
Simmer for another 30 minutes. Occasionally pour the sauce on top of the meat and rotate the meat and eggs. Make sure you have enough liquid so they won’t get burnt. When the sauce gets reduced and the meat has a nice glaze, it’s ready to serve. Serve the pork belly and eggs with Shiraga Negi on top.
If you prefer this dish to be less oily and have more flavor, wait for another day. Let cool completely and store it in the refrigerator overnight.

Grate ¼ apple, ½ clove garlic, and ½ knob ginger.
Add the grated apple, garlic, and ginger into the sauce and mix all together.
Place the meat in a single layer and drizzle some of the sauce on top. The sauce does not have to cover the entire meat. In Japanese BBQ restaurants, they usually just drizzle a small amount to the meat.
Peel the carrot. Use a julienne peeler or a knife to cut the carrot into julienned strips.
Cut the cucumber diagonally into thin slices and then cut them into thin strips.
Cut off the green part of the green onions and we will only use the white part. Cut the white part in half lengthwise and thinly slice into long strips. Soak in iced water to make them crisp and curl.
Heat the griddle or frying pan or outdoor grill and brush the oil on the griddle. When it’s hot, start cooking the meat. Once you get nice char on one side, flip and cook the other side. Cooking time varies depends on the meat and its thickness. Set aside.

Use a mesh/wire rack and grill eggplant on high heat. Do you see the steam coming off from eggplant? Grill until the skin gets completely burnt and the entire eggplant becomes wilted. Remove from the heat.
Dip your fingers in iced water and start peeling the skin off. You can peel off the skin similar to a banana since there are several incisions already made. You have to peel it off quickly before the purple skin color transfer to the nice green eggplant color.

Add the chicken to the marinade. Coat and rub the chicken with marinade using your hands/tongs. Set aside for 30 to 60 minutes.
In a medium bowl, combine potato starch and rice flour and whisk well.

When the oil is hot, drain the chicken well from the marinade and coat each piece with the flour mixture.
Deep fry for 90 seconds, or until the chicken is light golden color. Work with a few pieces at a time, so the oil temperature won’t drop quickly. I worked with 3 to 4 pieces at a time.
Transfer the chicken to a wire rack to drain excess oil. Let the chicken cook with the remaining heat while you work on the rest of the chicken.
Once the chicken is all deep-fried for the first round, use a fine-mesh sieve to pick up crumbs to keep the oil clean. If you don't do this step, the crumbs get darker, and then the oil gets darker.

Measure the weight of edamame pods (if you do this once, you know the rough amount next time without measuring).
Now we’re ready to begin. Prepare 1000 ml water (4 ¼ cup) and 40 g kosher salt (2 Tbsp + ½ tsp)
Start boiling water in a pot. Using a pair of kitchen shears, cut off both ends of edamame pods. If the water starts boiling, cover and turn off the heat for now.
Place the edamame in a bowl or tray and sprinkle 1 Tbsp of (40 g) kosher salt. Rub the pods against each other with hands.
Add the rest of the kosher salt into the boiling water.
Then add the edamame pods WITHOUT removing the salt. Cook on medium heat for 3-5 minutes depending on the size of the pods. It’s easy to remember 4 minutes, but start checking the doneness after passing 3.5 minutes. Remember we do not run cold water on edamame after boiling so I recommend under-cooking slightly.
Stir occasionally to make sure all the pods are cooking evenly. If you see the foam forming on the water, remove it with a fine mesh skimmer because we do not wash the pods after cooking.
Drain water in the sink or scoop up the edamame pods to a sieve. Let cool naturally so the edamame can absorb the flavor (If you skip cutting the ends of pods, please leave it for at least 1 hour). If you like, sprinkle a little bit of salt (I used sea salt flakes). Enjoy!

Set up a steamer with water in the pot, and bring to boil (and turn off and keep the lid on). I use this Nagashikan (Egg Tofu Ramekin). You can buy on Amazon (finally they have one!) or check this site to purchase. You can also use a square/rectangular container, or individual bowl such as chawanmushi cups.
Make the Sauce
In a small saucepan, bring 2 Tbsp mirin to boil and let the alcohol evaporate. When the alcohol smell disappears (after 10-15 seconds), add 150 ml dashi.
And add 1 Tbsp usukuchi soy sauce and bring to boil. Once boiling, turn off the heat and set aside.
Make Egg Tofu
Crack the eggs and whisk well. Add 2 tsp usukuchi soy sauce, ⅛ tsp kosher salt, and 300 ml dashi.
Strain the egg mixture in the fine mesh sieve to achieve silky fine texture. I believe this step makes a huge difference with the final result.
Quickly rinse the Nagashikan under cold running water and pour the egg mixture into the Nagashikan.
Scoop small bubbles on the surface with a spoon. Place the Nagashikan (or ramekin) on the steamer* rack. After trying this recipe a few more times, I also figured out a new trick. It was a bit harder to take it out the hot stainless steel Nagashikan. If you place a piece of cotton cloth underneath and sides, you can easily pull up using the cloth later. This also prevents overheating the bottom of Nagashikan from the heat beneath. *As my bamboo steamer didn't have enough height for my egg tofu ramekin to go inside, I used a 5 1/2 QT Le Creuset Dutch oven and an 8 5/8"" round cooling rack as a steamer.
Close the lid wrapped with a large kitchen towel; otherwise, the condensation built on the lid will drop onto your Tamago Tofu and ruin it. The pot should be left with the lid slightly ajar so inside the pot will not be super hot, but hot enough. Steam on the lowest heat possible on the stove for 20 minutes, or until the skewer inserted comes out clean.
Once it’s done, take out from the steamer immediately and let cool on the counter top and chill in the refrigerator for 2 hours. If you plan to serve immediately, place the Nagashikan in the ice water to cool.
Run the knife around the Nagashikan and slide out the Tamago Tofu.

You can use homemade gyoza or store-bought gyoza for this recipe.
Combine 100 ml water and 2 tsp all-purpose flour.
Heat 1 Tbsp neutral flavor oil in a frying pan over medium to medium-high heat.
Cook the gyoza until the bottom is golden brown (more toward light golden brown).
Remove the hot frying pan from the heat and press on a damp cold towel for 3-5 seconds to cool the pan immediately.
Put the frying pan back to the heat. Whisk the flour mixture well one more time and pour the flour mixture into the pan. Cover the pan with a lid and cook on medium-low heat for 6-7 minutes.
If you have a glass lid, you can see the cooking process. If you don’t have a glass lid, check the amount of the liquid once in a while.
When gyoza is cooked through (skin is more see-through) and the flour mixture is almost evaporated, open the lid.
Since the gyoza is cooked already, all you need to do is to let the water evaporated. When the edges of the wings start to peel off from the pan (see right picture below), drizzle sesame oil around the edge of the wings. Adjust the heat according to the color of the wings. If it’s lighter, you can increase the heat slightly.
The sesame oil not only gives a delicious flavor, but also helps cook the flour mixture to make it crispy. Shake the pan a few times to detach the wings from the pan. You can use chopsticks to gently poke around the edges.
Put a plate over the gyoza and flip over. Tip: If you use a plate that’s smaller than a frying pan, you can gently press the gyoza so it doesn’t move around. It’s much easier to flip than using a larger plate. Be very careful as the oil might drip from the pan while you flip.

Day 1
Peel the lotus root and scrape the sides lengthwise with a fork. Creating a rough surface helps the batter stick to the lotus root.
Trim both ends. If the lotus root is longer than 4"" (10 cm) in length, cut it in half. Place the lotus root in a saucepan and add just enough water to cover. Add 1 tsp rice vinegar to prevent the lotus root from changing color.
Bring the water to a boil and cook for 6 minutes. Transfer to a sieve and let it stand upright to dry until the holes are completely dry (excess moisture will dilute the fillings).
In a bowl, combine 2 tsp karashi mustard and 1 Tbsp warm water and mix well.
In a medium bowl, combine 5 Tbsp panko, 1 Tbsp mirin, 1 Tbsp sugar, and 5 Tbsp white miso and mix well.
Add in the karashi mustard and mix all together.
Pile the mustard miso mixture into a small mound on a plate. Press the lotus root into the mixture repeatedly until it fills up the holes and overflow from the top.
Wipe off the excess mustard and let it stand upright on a clean plate. Cover with plastic wrap and keep in the refrigerator overnight for the best result (or minimum 5 hours).
Day 2
Next day, remove the excess mustard miso mixture from the top and bottom and wipe off the excess moisture with paper towel.
In a large bowl, beat 1 egg and sift 1 cup flour, 1 tbsp turmeric and ¼ tsp kosher salt into the bowl.
Mix all together and gradually add ½ cup water.
Stir until blended. The batter will be sticky and thick so it coats the lotus root well.
Add 3 cups oil in a small pot and bring the oil to 350ºF (180ºC) over medium heat. The oil should cover the lotus root when deep frying. Therefore, a smaller pot works better so you can use less oil.
Insert 2 bamboo skewers into the side of the lotus root. Dredge the lotus root in the batter.
Using a spoon, make sure the lotus root is completely covered with the batter. Ideally, you want to smooth out the surface. (I know, it can be challenging, as the batter tends to fall off when you touch it. Let’s do your best.).
When the oil reaches 350ºF (180ºC) (or drop a small amount of the batter in the oil and if it floats back to the surface in a few seconds, it’s ready.), submerge the lotus root, holding the bamboo sticks. Deep fry for 5 minutes. Make sure the lotus root is NOT TOUCHING the bottom of the pot; otherwise, the batter will stick to the bottom. Deep fry until crisp and golden brown. Drain excess oil on the wire rack until it’s cool enough to handle.
Slice the Karashi Renkon into ⅓ inch (8 mm) thick rounds. Serve immediately.

Cut the Brie cheese in half if you haven’t already and place the half in the freezer for 20 minutes (Store the other half in the fridge for another use). Placing the Brie cheese in the freezer for 20 minutes makes it easier to cut. Generously grease a mini muffin pan with cooking spray.
Take out one frozen puff pastry sheet and place it on a working surface sprinkled with a bit of flour. Leave it out for 10 minutes or so (depending on the room temperature) and when the puff pastry sheet is a bit softer, unfold and continue to have it thawed.
Roll the puff pastry sheet out into a 10 x 14-inch (25 x 36-cm) rectangle.
Cut the sheet crosswise into 6 even strips.
Then cut the sheet lengthwise into 4 even strips. You should have 24 squares (each square will be about 2 ½ inches on each side).
Separate the squares and press them gently into the muffin cups.
Remove the rind only from the side edges (I keep the top and bottom). The rind is edible and barely noticeable once the Brie is baked. However, I like to remove the side edges so the corner pieces don’t have too much rind.
Cut chilled Brie cheese into 24 pieces. It’s easier to cut the creamy Brie into cubes when it’s chilled and has a firm texture.
Place in 1 piece of Brie and top with a teaspoon of cranberry sauce to each pastry-lined muffin cup.
Chop candied pecans and walnuts.
Top with a teaspoon of chopped walnuts. Chill for at least 30 minutes. The cold temperatures will firm up the pastry, which will help the butter in the dough will melt more slowly. If you are making ahead, wrap them in plastic wrap and store in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.
Preheat oven to 375ºF (190ºC). Bake the bites in the preheated oven until golden brown, 18 to 20 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown and the cheese and cranberry sauce are bubbly.
Remove from the oven, let cool in the pan for a few minutes. Transfer the bites to a serving plate and garnish with sea salt and thyme (optional). Serve warm or at room temperature.
To Store
You can store leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.
