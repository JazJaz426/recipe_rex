Using a spoon, scrape off brown spots. Then thinly slice with a peeler.
Sprinkle ½ tsp salt and set aside for 5 minutes. Then add the ginger into boiling water and cook for 1-3 minutes. If you want to keep it spicy, take it out after 1 minute. Otherwise, 2-3 minutes is good.
Drain the ginger slices over a sieve and then spread them out in a single layer. With your clean hands, squeeze the water out and put them in a sterilized jar or Mason jar.
In a small pot, add 100 ml (½ cup minus 4 tsp) rice vinegar, 4 Tbsp sugar, and ½ tsp salt. Bring it to a boil till a strong vinegar smell has evaporated, roughly 1 minute. Remove from the heat and let cool slightly. Pour the vinegar mixture into the jar with sliced ginger. Close the lid, let cool, and refrigerate.
After 4 hours or so, the ginger will turn slightly pink. I recommend waiting till the following day or for a few days.

Combine all the ingredients for the dipping sauce and set aside.
Cut the end of scallions and then cut in half. If you’re worried about flipping large pancakes, cut the scallions shorter and make smaller round pancakes so you can easily flip.
Beat the egg in a small bowl and set aside.
Combine cake flour and salt in a medium bowl to make the batter. Slowly add cold water (you may not need all of it!) and whisk till just combined. Do not over mix the batter because it’ll create gluten and the pancake won’t have a good texture.
Place a non-stick frying pan over medium high heat and add the oil when the pan is hot. Then spread out the scallions on the bottom of the pan and add the shrimps.
Drizzle the batter to cover the scallion and shrimp, and make sure there is batter between the ingredients so that they will be held together. However, don’t put too much batter either to avoid having doughy pancakes.
Lightly pour the beaten egg (I usually use half of one egg) over the batter. Cook for 3 minutes, until the edge of the pancake gets crispy and the bottom of the pancake is nice golden brown. Flip and cook for another 3 minutes, pressing down the pancake with spatula occasionally, until the pancake is crispy and golden brown. Flip one last time and cook for 30 seconds.
Transfer to a cutting board. Cut into small pieces and enjoy with the dipping sauce.

Takikomi Gohan (Japanese Mixed Rice),Namiko Chen,https://www.justonecookbook.com/takikomi-gohan/,Japanese,https://www.justonecookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Takikomi-Gohan-V.jpg,"['2 rice cooker cups uncooked Japanese short-grain rice', '3 dried shiitake mushrooms ((0.5 oz, 15 g))', '½ cup water', '⅓ package konnyaku (konjac) ((3 oz, 85 g))', '1 piece aburaage (deep-fried tofu pouch) ((¾ oz, 20 g))', '2 oz carrot ((3"", 7.5 cm))', '1 oz gobo (burdock root) ((4"", 10 cm))', '1 boneless, skinless chicken thigh ((4.8 oz, 135 g))', '1 ½ cup dashi (Japanese soup stock; click to learn more)', '1 ½ Tbsp mirin', '1 ½ Tbsp soy sauce', 'mitsuba (Japanese parsley) ((you can substitute it with green onion/scallion))']","Prepare all the ingredients.
Wash the rice in a large bowl. Rice absorbs water very quickly when you start washing, so don't let the rice absorb the opaque water. Gently wash the rice in a circular motion and discard the water. Repeat this process about 3-4 times.
Let the rice soak in water for 30-60 minutes. This helps the rice absorb the seasonings later on and become more tender and moist after cooking. Transfer the rice into a sieve and drain completely for at least 15 minutes. Place the washed and drained rice in the rice cooker.
Meanwhile, prepare the other ingredients. Soak 3 dried shiitake mushrooms in a ½ cup of water for 15 minutes. I place a smaller bowl on top to keep the mushrooms submerged in the water at all times.
In a small saucepan, bring 2 cups of water to boil. Put ⅓ konnyaku and cook for 1 minute to get rid of the smell. Transfer the konnyaku to a plate to cool. Add the aburaage to the same pot of water and cook for 1 minute. This removes excess oil from the aburaage. Transfer aburaage to a plate to cool. Discard the water.
Shave off the gobo skin with the back of the knife. Don’t peel the gobo with a peeler to keep the earthy flavor and fragrance. Then make a “cross” slit on tip of the gobo as you see in the picture below.
Make a lengthwise cross-shape incision about 1 ½ inch (3.8 cm) deep at one end. Shave from that end as if you were sharpening a pencil with a knife while constantly rotating with the other hand. Soak in the water to prevent it from changing color.
Cut the carrot in half lengthwise and cut diagonally into thin slices. Then cut the slices into julienned or smaller pieces.
Cut the aburaage and konnyaku into thin small strips.
Cut the chicken thigh into ¾ inch (2 cm) slanted pieces. Hold your knife at 45-degree angle and slice the chicken. This “sogigiri” cutting technique gives the chicken more surface area so it will cook faster and soak up flavors quickly.
Squeeze the liquid from dried shiitake mushrooms and save the liquid (this is called Shiitake Dashi). Remove the stem and cut the caps into thinly slices.
Strain the Shiitake Dashi into a bowl through a fine mesh strainer to get rid of dirty particles. Set aside. In a measuring cup, add all the shiitake dashi and then pour dashi so you’ll have 1 ½ cup (360 ml) of liquid. Add it to the rice cooker and mix well.
Now your ingredients are ready!
Add 1 ½ Tbsp soy sauce and 1 ½ Tbsp mirin to the rice.
Pour the dashi & shiitake dashi mixture into the rice and mix well.
Add the chicken and evenly distribute over the rice. Do NOT mix the rice with ingredients. The rice won’t be able to absorb enough water to cook and it will end up with a hard texture. Continue from the hard ingredients to softer ingredients. Without mixing all up, start cooking the rice. If you have a “Mixed Rice” option, use it (See Notes below).
Once the rice is done cooking, use a rice paddle to stir the rice and vegetables with light slicing and tossing motions to distribute the ingredients evenly. The bottom of the rice gets slightly caramelized, and this part is called Okoge and it’s especially tasty.
Serve the rice hot or at room temperature. Sprinkle chopped mitsuba or green onion on top.

Prepare the Ingredients
Soak the kombu in ¾ cup water. After 30 minutes, you now have cold brew kombu dashi.
Meanwhile, peel and cut the lotus root into ¼ inch pieces (0.6 mm). If you want to make lotus root into a flower shape, see the optional step below.
Optional Step 1: To make flower-shaped lotus root (Hana Renkon), cut the lotus root into a 2-inch length so it’s easy to work with. Cut out the “V” shape between two holes.
Optional Step 2: Remove the v-shape part and continue to the next area between the holes.
Add 1 tsp rice vinegar in 4 cups (1L) of water. Soak the lotus root slices for 5 minutes to prevent changing of color and to remove the astringent taste.
Cook Lotus Root
In a medium saucepan, combine kombu dashi (with kombu), ½ cup rice vinegar, 3 Tbsp sugar, and ¾ tsp kosher salt. Turn on the heat to medium heat and mix well.
Add the lotus root slices and spread out evenly.
Right before the sauce comes to a full boil, remove the kombu. Place an otoshibuta over.
Cook with the otoshibuta for 5-8 minutes, or until the inserted skewer goes through smoothly.

Maple and Miso Glazed Roasted Carrots,Namiko Chen,https://www.justonecookbook.com/maple-and-miso-glazed-roasted-carrots/,American,https://www.justonecookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Maple-and-Miso-Glazed-Roasted-Carrots-0715-I.jpg,"['1 lb carrots ((I used rainbow carrots))', '1 Tbsp extra-virgin olive oil', '¼ tsp kosher/sea salt (I use Diamond Crystal; Use half for table salt)', 'freshly ground black pepper', '1 Tbsp maple syrup', '1 Tbsp miso ((I used reduced salt Enjuku Koji Miso))', '½ tsp soy sauce', 'fresh thyme']","Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat the oven to 425 °F (220 ºC). Gather all the ingredients. If your carrots still have some moisture after washing, be sure to pat them as dry as possible; the drier the vegetable, the better it will roast.
In a small bowl, mix together 1 Tbsp maple syrup, 1 Tbsp miso, and ½ tsp soy sauce.
Peel the carrots (and if they are large, cut uniform slices so that they will roast evenly and be finished at the same time). Place the carrots in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet lined with parchment paper (for easy clean-up). If the carrots are arranged too closely together or are on top of one another, they will steam, making them mushy rather than caramelized. Use a bigger baking sheet or 2 instead.
Drizzle the olive oil and sprinkle salt and pepper. You want each carrot to have a light coating of oil (the oil keeps some moisture in for that interior tenderness). A good rule of thumb is about 2 Tbsp of oil per baking sheet (I'm using a half sheet).
Toss/Roll the carrots with oil and seasoning.
Place in the oven and bake for 20-30 minutes, rotating the baking sheet halfway through to ensure that the carrots are getting equal exposure to the heat and have an equal chance at getting crispy and caramelized. The roasting time may vary depending on the size of the carrots (young thin carrots require less cooking time). When carrots are lightly browned and almost tender when pierced with a wooden skewer, remove the baking sheet from the oven. Why almost tender? We still need to roast for 5 more minutes after brushing the sauce.
Brush the maple and miso mixture over the carrots and flip to coat the other side. Put back in the oven to finish cooking, about 5 more minutes. The vegetables will start to brown on the bottom first (the side in contact with a hot surface will brown faster than the sides in touch with hot air), so for even browning you'll need to turn them.
Remove from the oven and serve warm, garnished with thyme if desired.

The box says you do not need to soak, but I still recommend washing the koyadofu. Put the koyadofu in a bowl and pour hot water. The koyadofu will expand in about 10 minutes.
While you wait for the koyadofu to expand, put dashi in a pot. I use cold brew kombu dashi for this recipe, leaving the kombu behind. Add mirin and sake.
Add soy sauce, sugar, and salt.
Mix all together and slowly bring it to boil.
While waiting for the broth to boil, wash the koyadofu in clean cold water once it expands. Be careful with the koyadofu as the inside still contains hot water.
Like a sponge, let the koyadofu soak up the clean water and push it out a few times to clean. Hold the tofu flat between your hands. Squeeze the cloudy water from the inside of the koyadofu by pressing hard.
Change the water in the bowl several times to clean all the koyadofu. Thoroughly wash out the cloudy water by repeating this process several times. Give it a final squeeze.
Cut each koyadofu into 6 square pieces.
Once the dashi-soy broth is boiling, add the koyadofu and cover with a drop lid (Otoshibuta – if you don’t have one, make one with aluminum foil). You do not use a regular lid on top. Simmer for 10 minutes on medium-low heat.
When it’s about to finish simmering, prepare the snow peas by removing the tough strings. Add the snow peas in the saucepan.
Cook for 1-2 minutes. Then transfer the koyadofu to a glass container.
Make sure the glass container is big enough to hold the koyadofu and the broth. I stack the koyadofu neatly.

Also, prepare a clean container with a lid for each vegetable. You can also put all vegetables (except for eggplants) in one big container.
Measure the Weight (Important!)
Decide the amount of salt you want to use and weigh the salt (Please read the blog post). This recipe is 5% brine (50 grams of sea salt in 1000 ml of water) and made double batch (100 grams of sea salt in 2000 ml of water) as I used a lot of vegetables to demonstrate.
Weigh each vegetable you’re pickling and write down the number. At the next step, you'll need to find out the weight of the heavy objects to put on the vegetables.
Figure out which heavy object to use. Make sure to include the plate that goes under the heavy object. The total weight (object + plate) needs to be 1.5 to 2 times of the total vegetable weight. You can use several plates, pie weights in a plastic bag, etc.
Prepare the Brine
Put the measured water and sea salt in the pot and let the salt dissolved completely over medium heat. You do not need to let it boil. You can turn off the heat once it’s warm and salt is completely dissolved. Let cool. Tip: In winter, it’s fast if you put the pot outside (leaving the lid slightly ajar). In summer, make the brine the previous day.
Cut the Vegetables (If Necessary)
Eggplants: Cut off the end of eggplants. When you are making Asazuke (quick pickles), cut the eggplant in half or cut a slit vertically about half the length in the eggplant to let the salt brine absorb. Otherwise, you don’t need to cut the eggplants. Place them in the container. Tip: To prevent the beautiful eggplants from discoloring, I used 'Lucky Iron Fish' - a cooking tool that retains colors and adds iron to foods. It is optional but worth investing especially if you need more iron in your diet. You can purchase it on Amazon. I also use 'Lucky Iron Fish' when I make Kuromame.
Cucumbers: You don’t need to cut. Place them in the container.
Daikon radish: Peel and cut in half or quarters vertically depending on its size. Place them in the container.
Celeries: Remove the leafy parts and cut into the length that would fit in the container. Place them in the container.
Carrots: Peel and cut into the length that would fit in the container. Place them in the container.
To Pickle Vegetables
Eggplants: Pour the brine until they are submerged.
Place a plate on top of the vegetable, and then put a weight on the plate. You can use plates and pie weights. Make sure the vegetables are completely submerged. Place a lid on and close tightly.
Cucumbers: Pour the brine until they are submerged.
Daikon radish: Pour the brine until they are submerged.
Celeries: Pour the brine until they are submerged.
Carrots: Pour the brine until they are submerged.
Pickling Time
Keep the tsukemono at room temperature for the best pickling. For my 5% brine, the best pickling time 8 hours. Tip: You can adjust the pickling time according to your preference. Dense vegetable takes longer time to pickle than less dense vegetables. Please read the blog post.
To Take Out and Serve
Remove the eggplants and Lucky Iron Fish from the brine and transfer to a clean airtight container or resealable plastic bag.
Remove other vegetables from the brine and transfer to a clean airtight container.
To Serve
Cut the tsukemono into slices when you are ready to serve.
Serve on a plate and enjoy!
To Store
With 5% brine, you can keep the shiozuke in the refrigerator for up to 4 days. Do not cut the tsukemono into slices until you are ready to serve.
Reuse of the Leftover Brine
You can reuse the brine for up to a month. You may need to add more salt as the brine will become less salty. Also, it's good to boil the brine to keep it germ-free.",en-US,{},4.63,,Just One Cookbook,500,4 serving(s)

Thoroughly skim the scum and foam off the surface.
When it's done, put an Otoshibuta and a regular pot lid. The otoshibuta is to keep the soybeans under the cooking liquid (which is to prevent the beans from getting wrinkles). Reduce heat to low and simmer (make sure beans are not bouncing around) for 4 hours or until the beans are tender.
Check inside the pot a few times to make sure there is enough cooking liquid. If not enough, add water (I added 1 cup water). Skim the surface if needed.
Check if the beans are tender by mashing a bean with two fingers. Take out the rusty nails/Iron Fish.

Gather all the instructions.
To Prepare the Pork Belly
1.Roll up the pork belly, making sure one or both ends should have the “bacon” like appearance, showing the varying layers of meat and fat. If your slab comes with the skin (rind), it should be removed. Ask your butcher and they may remove it for you.
Run some butcher twine under the far end of the log. Tie a double knot to secure the pork tightly. Make sure you leave about 3 inches (7.5 cm) twine at the end.
Wrap around the pork belly 2-3 times around the same area to secure the end. Then pull the twine to the other end of the pork belly. Wrap around 2-3 times at the end area to secure before working toward the middle. Each wrap should be a ⅓ inch (1 cm) in between.
Continue wrapping around the pork belly toward the end (where you started). Make sure it’s wrapped as tightly as possible.
Once you reach the end, run the butcher twine under some wraps to hook and go back to the starting point. Find the 3-inch (7.5 cm) twine you leave behind.
Tie a double knot with the long twine and the 3-inch (7.5 cm) twine.
To Cut Aromatics
Cut off the green part of the long green onion and slice the ginger.
To Sear the Pork Belly
Heat the oil in a cast iron skillet (or regular frying pan) over high heat. Add the rolled pork belly in the pan.
Sear the pork belly one side at a time, rotating to make sure all sides are nicely seared.
It’ll take about 10-15 minutes all together.
To Prepare the Sauce
While searing, put all the ingredients for seasonings in a heavy-bottom pot that fits the chashu.
To Simmer Chashu
Transfer the seared chashu into the Dutch oven.
Bring the liquid to a boil.
Once boiling, skim off the foam and scum. Then turn the heat to low/simmer.
Put an otoshibuta (drop lid) on top to press the ingredient down. You do not need to use the regular lid and limit the evaporation by just otoshibuta. If you don’t have the otoshibuta, you can make it with aluminum foil (here’s how to make Otoshibuta).
Simmer on low heat, and cover with the otoshibuta at all times for the next 2 hours, rotating chashu every 30 minutes.
The sauce has been reduced. After 2 hours, turn off the heat to let cool a little bit.
To Rest Chashu Overnight
Once the meat is slightly cooled, transfer to a container or plastic food saver bag. Strain the leftover cooking liquid over a fine-mesh strainer. The liquid is roughly 2 ½ cup.
Add ½ cup of the cooking liquid into the bag.
Seal the bag with food saver. TIP: Fold a piece of paper towel to plug the entry of the Food Saver bag. This paper towel will absorb all the moisture when you seal.
I also made a quick ramen egg (ajitsuke tamago) with the leftover liquid. You make soft boiled eggs and add ½ cup of cooking liquid in the bag. Cover the cooking liquid and store chashu, ramen egg, and the cooking liquid in the refrigerator.
DAY 2
Open the bag of chashu.
Cut the twine with kitchen shears and remove them completely.
Slice the chashu into ¼ inch pieces (Keep the edge for chashu fried rice!).
Place the chashu slices on a ceramic plate and use a propane torch or broiler to sear the chashu slices to enhance the flavor. Then enjoy them immediately or serve on your ramen.
Scoop up the solidified fat from the cooking sauce.
Prepare a mason jar or container and strain the sauce over a fine-mesh sieve to make sure the solidified fat is left behind. The sauce will last for a month in the refrigerator. I use it for drizzling over the chashu and making stir-fries, marinade, and ramen eggs.
To Store
You can store the chashu in the refrigerator up to 7 days and 1 month in the freezer. I usually divide the rolled chashu into thirds and freeze 2 portions separately (for Ramen right away, and chashu fried rice and chashu Don for later). Ramen eggs should be consumed in 3-4 days if they are soft-boiled eggs and 7 days if hard-boiled eggs. The eggs get salty as you keep in the marinade, so remove from the sauce when they have the right taste.
FOR NON-ROLLED CHASHU
Gather all the ingredients. For small blocks of pork belly, you don't need to roll them up before cooking and simmering time is just 1 hour (instead of 2 hours).
Heat the oil in a cast iron skillet (or regular frying pan) over high heat. Sear the fat side down first, then flip over to sear all sides, which will take about 10 minutes.
While searing, put all the ingredients for seasonings in a heavy-bottom pot (or regular pot) that fits the chashu. Add the chashu and bring it to a boil, skimming the scum and foam. Then turn the heat to low/simmer.
Put an otoshibuta (drop lid) on top to press the ingredient down and limit the evaporation. If you don’t have an otoshibuta, you can make it with aluminum foil. (here’s how to make otoshibuta). Simmer on low heat for the next one hour, rotating chashu every 15 minutes (keep otoshibuta on all times!).
After one hour, there is ½ inch liquid left in the pot. Now you have 2 options. Option 1: If you're serving right away, remove the otoshibuta and further cook down the sauce on low heat until the sauce gets thicken and see the bottom of the pot when you draw a line with a spatula. Option 2 (recommended): Transfer the chashu to a container or a bag with a little bit of cooking sauce and refrigerate overnight. Strain the leftover cooking sauce and refrigerate.
To serve, slice the chashu into ¼ inch pieces. You can use a propane torch or broiler to sear the chashu slices to enhance the flavor. If you kept the chashu overnight and don't want to sear the chashu, you can reheat it by soaking in the hot cooking sauce.",en-US,{},4.61,,Just One Cookbook,640,8 serving(s)

Wash azuki beans and soak for half a day (or overnight).
Combine both glutinous rice and Japanese short-grain rice into a bowl and wash them thoroughly (See Step 1-4 on). Drain the rice for 30 minutes.
Put azuki beans in a small pot (don't use a large pot). Put water to just cover the beans (you don’t want to put water too much here) and bring it to a boil on high heat.
Once it boils, turn off the heat and transfer the beans into a sieve to drain the water.
Put azuki beans back in the pot and add 2½ cup water. Bring it to a boil on high heat. Once it boils, turn down the heat to low and cover the lid. Keep it simmering for 15 minutes (it depends on Azuki beans). Beans are done when you can smash a bean with your fingers.
When it’s done, reserve the cooking red water and beans separately in a bowl. Use plastic wrap to cover the beans so it doesn’t dry out and crack. Let them cool down completely.

Dried Shiitake Mushrooms
In a small bowl, put dried shiitake mushrooms and 1 cup water and soak for 20-30 minutes, or until tender.
After 30 minutes or so, squeeze the liquid out from the shiitake mushrooms.
Cut the shiitake mushrooms into a hexagon, which represents turtle shape for longevity.
Strain the liquid through a fine-mesh sieve. This is called shiitake dashi. It yields roughly ¾ cup.
Chicken
Remove extra fat of the chicken and cut into 1 ½ inch (3.8 cm) pieces.
Transfer the chicken in a medium bowl and add ½ Tbsp sake and ½ Tbsp soy sauce. Coat the chicken with the marinade and set aside.
Burdock Root (Gobo)
Scrape the skin off the burdock root with the back of the knife. After rinsing, cut it into thin slices.
Prepare a bowl of 2 cups water and ½ Tbsp vinegar. Soak the burdock root in the water for 15 minutes.
Japanese Taro Roots (Satoimo)
Cut off the ends of taro. Then peel from one end to the other.
Ideally, taro should be a hexagon (6 sides) from the side view.
Cut the taro in half and soak in water. You can rub them with salt to get rid of the sliminess if that bothers you.
Bamboo Shoot
Cut the bamboo shoot into quarters lengthwise.
Cut the bamboo shoot in half widthwise. If each piece is still bigger than bite-size, you can cut in half.
Lotus Roots (Renkon)
Cut the lotus root into Hana Renkon.
The lotus root should resemble flowers after cutting the edges off.
Cut them into ⅛ inch (3 mm) slices. Prepare a bowl of 2 cups water and ½ Tbsp vinegar. Soak the lotus root in the water for 15 minutes.
Carrot (Nejiri Ume)
Peel the carrot and cut into ½ inch (1.3 cm) pieces.
Use a flower-shaped vegetable cutter and cut out each piece into a flower shape. Then make a shallow (roughly ¼ inch deep) incision from the center of the flower to in-between the two petals.
Hold a knife parallel to one petal and make a diagonal cut from right to left in-between petals.
This is called Nejiri Ume.
Konnyaku
Cut konnyaku into ¼ inch (6 mm) slices and then make a 1 ½ inch (3.8 cm) incision in the middle.
Put one end of konnyaku into the hole in the middle and pull it out. This is called Tazuna Konnyaku.
Snow Peas
Pull the strings at the seams of the snow peas and discard them. These are tough and not edible.
To Blanch Vegetables and Konnyaku
Boil water in a saucepan and blanch half of the flower carrot for 2 minutes and set aside.
Add a pinch of salt and blanch the snow pea pods for 30-60 seconds, until crisp but tender enough to eat.
Remove the snow peas from the water and transfer to the ice water to stop cooking and set aside.
In the same boiling water, add konnyaku. After boiling again, cook for 2-3 minutes to remove the smell.
Diagonally cut the blanched snow peas in half and set aside.
To Make Chikuzenni
In the large pot, heat 1 Tbsp of sesame oil over medium heat. When it’s hot, add the chicken.
Cook the chicken until it turns white. Transfer the chicken to a plate.
Add ½ Tbsp sesame oil and cook all the ingredients except the blanched snow peas and carrots reserved for decoration.
Stir and coat the ingredients with sesame oil.
Add dashi and shiitake dashi.
Bring it to a simmer over medium heat. Skim off the fat and scum that accumulates on the surface.
Add sake, mirin, sugar, soy sauce, and salt.
Add the chicken back into the pot. Bring it to a simmer. As you see, the stock should cover about 80% of the ingredients.
Put an otoshibuta (drop lid) on the ingredients and cook for 10 minutes. If you don't have one, you can make an Otoshibuta with aluminum foil.
Remove Otoshibuta and cook for another 10 minutes.
Insert a bamboo skewer into tough vegetables (taro root and lotus root) and see if they are tender. Taste and adjust seasonings if needed.
To Serve
Add the snow peas and remove from the heat. Cover, and let cool. Serve Chikuzenni in a serving dish or Osechi box. Top with the snow peas and blanched flower shaped carrots.
To Store
Keep the leftovers in an airtight container and store it in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. The flavor will intensify as time passes, so if you plan to serve it later, you may consider reducing the amount of seasoning.

If your green beans are not trimmed, snap the tip of one end of the bean with your fingers and draw it down the length of one side of the bean to remove any possible string. Do the same thing with the other end, pulling it down the other side of the bean.
To Prepare Green Beans
Have ready a large bowl of ice water. Bring a large pot of water (3 QT) to a boil over medium-high heat. When the water is at a rolling boil, add 1 tsp salt, then green beans.
Cook until beans are just tender, 3 minutes for French green beans; 4 to 5 minutes for regular green beans. Taste test for doneness. They are done when they are just cooked through but still have the slightest crunch of texture. Drain the green beans immediately.
Transfer the green beans to the ice-water bath to make them greener and fresher. Drain again and set aside, or, if making in advance, dry them thoroughly with a clean dry towel and refrigerate in an airtight container for a day or two.

Rinse the rice under cold water, by gently rubbing the rice with your fingertips in a circling motion. Submerge the rice in water and pour out the starchy water. Rinse and repeat until the water becomes clear. Soak rice in water for 20-30 minutes. Meanwhile, start preparing the next ingredients. After soaking for 20-30 minutes, drain water completely and set aside for 10 minutes. If you don’t have time to wait, then shake off the excess water the best you can.
To Prepare Katsuo Dashi
Add 1 ½ cup water in a saucepan and bring it to almost boil. Add 1 cup packed katsuobushi to the water, reduce the heat, simmer for 30 seconds, and turn off the heat. Set aside and let the katsuobushi sink to the bottom, about 10 minutes.
Strain the dashi through a fine-mesh sieve over a liquid measuring cup. You need exactly 340 ml. If you don’t have enough, add water. If you have too much, then take it out. Tip: You can use used katsuobushi for Second Dashi (Niban Dashi) or make homemade furikake.
Add 2 Tbsp sake, 2 Tbsp usukuchi soy sauce (or regular soy sauce), and ½ tsp kosher salt. Usukuchi soy sauce (lighter color soy sauce) will not darken the rice as much as regular soy sauce.
Mix well to combine and let the salt dissolve completely. At the end, you should have 400 ml of broth.
To Prepare Ingredients
Prepare boiling water and pour over the aburaage to remove excess oil. Cut in half first and then cut into thin strips. Squeeze excess water out.
Open the packaged bamboo shoot and cut in half. Some pieces may be bigger or smaller, but you will need 5.3 oz (150 g).
Then cut the halves into quarters. The key here is to cut into smaller pieces so it’s easy to eat with rice. I usually keep the tip of bamboo, roughly ¾ inch length as intact (a triangle shape looks cute for presentation).
Then for the rest of bottom bamboo parts, cut into thin slices.
To Cook Rice
The rice should be drained well by now. Add the rice into the donabe (or rice cooker/heavy bottom pot). Pour 400 ml broth you prepared, and make sure the rice is evenly distributed in the pot.
Evenly distribute the aburaage over the rice (DO NOT MIX with rice) and then bamboo shoot on top of aburaage (again do not mix with the rest). Rice needs to be steamed nicely and evenly and when it’s mixed with other ingredients, it will not be cooked.
If you’re using the Kamado-san, place the inner lid and then the donabe lid. Cook on medium-high heat (or medium for a professional stove) for 14 minutes.
Once it’s cooked, remove from the stove and set aside for 20 minutes.
Cooking with Rice Cooker
Choose “regular” or “mixed rice” mode and start cooking. If you use “regular” setting, let it steam for 10 minutes more to create “okoge” (burnt rice).
Cooking On the Stove
Bring it to boil on medium heat (you can peek to see if it’s boiling). Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook for 15 minutes, or until liquid is completely gone.

Mix together and turn off the heat. Set aside for 15 minutes. Then strain the katsuobushi with a fine-mesh sieve. Set the katsuo dashi aside for now. You can discard the katsuobushi or make furikake (rice seasonings) with the leftover katsuobushi.
Remove the seeds from the kabocha and microwave it for 2 minutes to soften the outer kabocha skin. You can skip microwaving if you have a sharp knife and the strength to cut through the skin.
Cut the kabocha into wedges, then equal 2” (5 cm) pieces. Remember, kabocha skin is edible and nutritious.
In a large pot, place the kabocha pieces in a single layer, skin side down.
Add dashi, sake, and sugar. Tip: Swirl the pot to mix the seasonings so you won't break the kabocha.
Cook on medium high heat and bring it to a boil.
Add soy sauce and salt, and swirl the pot again to mix the seasonings. If the liquid does not cover ¾ of kabocha, you can add a little bit of water. Bring to a boil again.
Once boiling turn down to medium-low heat to maintain the simmer. Cover with an otoshibuta (drop lid) and cook for 20-30 minutes (depends on size, and skin takes time to cook), or until the kabocha has a tiny thin crack near the skin (it’s a sign for doneness!). If you feel that liquid is evaporating too fast, you can cover the regular lid (and you still need to use otoshibuta).
Remove from the heat and let kabocha sit covered (with a pot lid) until cool, about 30 minutes. This helps kabocha absorbs more flavor as it cools. You can serve at room temperature or reheat before serving.

The rice to water ratio is 1 : 1.1 (or 1.2 ). Please read the blog post for a detailed explanation.
To Rinse the Rice
Overfill the plastic rice cooker cup (180 ml) and level off. In this recipe, I'm using 3 rice cooker cups (540 ml).
Add water just enough till it submerges all the rice. Then discard the water immediately. Repeat this process 2-3 times. Tip: Rice absorbs water very quickly when you start rinsing, so don't let the rice absorb the first few rounds of water.
Use your fingers to gently wash the rice in a circular motion for 10-15 seconds. Repeat this process 1-2 times.
Add water and discard the water. Repeat this process 1-2 times.
Repeat this process 2 more times.
When the water is almost clear, drain well. Tip: Use a fine-mesh sieve to drain and shake off excess water.
Transfer the drained rice to the rice cooker (I use the Zojirushi IH). Add water (600 ml for my 3 rice cooker cups).
To Cook the Rice
Soak the rice for 20-30 minutes (especially if you're using an older rice cooker). Select your menu and press ""Start"". Tip: Even though my rice cooker includes soaking time, I soak my rice for 20-30 minutes. Note: For this Zojirushi rice cooker, 3-cup ""regular"" white rice takes 55 minutes to cook, which already includes a 10-minute soaking time and 10-minute steaming time in the program.
Once the rice is done cooking, let it steam for 10 minutes (if your rice cooker does not include the steaming time). Open the lid and fluff the rice with a rice paddle.

Add 2 Tbsp soy sauce, 2 Tbsp sesame oil, 4 Tbsp mirin, and 2 Tbsp rice vinegar. Mix well.
Check the taste and add kosher salt if necessary. I added ¼ tsp salt.
To Prepare the Vegetables
Prepare all the ingredients. Make dashi; otherwise, use water instead.
Cut the sweet potatoes into ¼ inch slices (uniform smaller pieces will cook faster than larger pieces) and soak in water to remove starch. Drain and set aside.
Wash the gobo really well and peel it thinly with a peeler. Soak in water immediately to avoid color changes and change the water once. Drain and set aside.
Discard the seeds from kabocha and slice thinly.
You can either cut the carrot into ¼ inch slices or use a peeler to peel the carrot.
Cut the corn on the cob into 1-inch thickness.
Hold each asparagus, snap and discard the shorter bottom end. Cut the asparagus in half.
Cut the broccoli and cauliflower into florets.
Cut the napa cabbage into bite-size pieces.
To Steam
Pour the dashi in your steamer, cover the lid, and bring it to boil on medium-high heat. As a quick guide, dashi (or water) should be at least 1-2 inches to your steamer (pot). Insert the steamer basket. Make sure the surface of the dashi (or water) is not touching the basket. If it is, take out some water.
When steam is coming out from the pot strongly, reduce the heat to medium and place the hard vegetables such as sweet potatoes and root vegetables. I also added kabocha squash and corn here as the rest of ingredients are fairly fast to cook. Cover the pot and set timer for 5 minutes.
Then add “Flower” vegetables such as asparagus, broccoli, cauliflower, and the bottom part of the napa cabbage. I also added carrot peels here. Set the timer for 3 minutes.
Lastly, add the leafy part of the napa cabbage and mini tomatoes. Cook for 2 more minutes.
Insert a bamboo skewer to check the doneness of denser vegetables. If it goes through, it’s ready to eat! Stop the steaming when the vegetables are still a bit crunchy since the residual heat will continue to cook the vegetables.
Serve the steamed vegetables with Miso Sesame Sauce and enjoy! During the meal, you can continue to steam the vegetables. Keep an eye on the dashi/water inside the pot.

Cook the rice in the rice cooker, pot over the stove top or pressure cooker.
Let the cooked rice cool a little bit until you can hold rice without burning your hands. Do not let the rice completely cool down.
First, wet both of your hands with water so the rice won’t stick.
Then put some salt in your hands and rub to spread all around.
Scoop about a half cup of rice onto your palm.
Cover the rice with the other hand and gently form the rice into a triangle.
Make sure covering hand (my right hand) should be forming a triangle shape. When forming the onigiri shape, your hands should be just firm enough so the onigiri doesn't fall apart. You don't want to squeeze the rice too tight.
I use three fingers (thumb, index finger, middle finger) to cover the area to make a nice triangle shape. Then rotate onigiri to make a perfect triangle.
While you squeeze onigiri firmly with both hands, one of your hands has to press onigiri to keep a nice form.
Gently squeeze the center of triangle on both sides so there is a slight indentation (for grilling onigiri). Now onigiri is ready! You can tell I’m not a good onigiri maker – no matter how many years I have been practicing.
Lightly oil a cast iron skillet and put it on medium heat.
Grill onigiri until all sides are crispy and lightly browned. Don’t flip it quickly. Just work on one side at a time and avoid turning over frequently.
Lower heat to medium low and brush all sides with soy sauce (unagi sauce). Rotate to make sure all sides become crispy. Be careful not to burn onigiri after you brush it with the sauce.

How To Cook Japanese Rice on the Stove,Namiko Chen,https://www.justonecookbook.com/how-to-cook-rice/,Japanese,https://www.justonecookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/How-To-Cook-Rice.jpg,"['1 cup uncooked Japanese short-grain rice ((240 ml))', '1 ¼ cups water ((300 ml; You should deduct 5-10% of water for sushi rice))', '1 rice cooker cup uncooked Japanese short-grain rice ((180 ml))', '200 ml water ((You should deduct 5-10% of water for sushi rice))']","To Prepare Rice
For Japanese short-grain rice, the ideal rice to water ratio is 1 : 1.1 (or 1.2), which is 10-20% more water. For easy American ""cup"" measurement, I used 25% in this recipe (rice to water ratio is 1 : 1.25). If you have a precise milliliter measuring cup or kitchen scale, use the following measurement. 200 ml water for 1 rice cooker cup (180 ml). 400 ml water for 2 rice cooker cups (360 ml). 600 ml water for 3 rice cooker cups (540 ml). 800 ml water for 4 rice cooker cups (720 ml). 1000 ml water for 5 rice cooker cups (900 ml).
Put rice in a large bowl. Rice absorbs water very quickly when you start washing, so don't let the rice absorb the unclear water. Gently wash the rice in a circular motion and discard the water. Repeat this process about 3-4 times. Drain to a fine-mesh sieve and shake off excess water.
In a heavy-bottomed pot with a tight-fitting lid, put well-drained rice and measured water. Soak the rice for 20-30 minutes before cooking.
To Cook Rice
Close the lid and bring it to a boil over medium heat. Take a quick peek to see if water is boiling (otherwise do not open the lid).
Once water is boiling, turn the heat to low and cook covered for 12 to 13 minutes, or until the water is completely absorbed (take a quick peek!). If you see there is water left, close the lid and continue cooking for a little longer.
Remove the pot (with the lid on) from the heat source and let it steam for another 10 minutes.
Fluff the rice with a rice paddle when it’s done.
To Store Rice
Transfer the rice in airtight containers and close the lid to keep the moisture in. Let cool completely before storing the containers in the freezer (read my tutorial post).",en-US,{},4.75,,Just One Cookbook,50,2 serving(s)

To Prepare Sesame Sauce
In a frying pan (do not add oil), toast sesame seeds (2 Tbsp) until they are fragrant and starting to pop. Keep some distance from the heat and shake the pan to toast.
Transfer to a mortar (suribachi). Using a pestle (surikogi), grind the sesame seeds until 80% of the sesame seeds are ground (to keep the texture of sesame seeds).
Add soy sauce (1 Tbsp), mirin (1 Tbsp), and rice vinegar (1 tsp) to the sesame seeds.
To Prepare Gobo
Peel gobo skin with the back of a knife. Don’t use a vegetable peeler to peel gobo’s skin because the earthy delicious flavor is just right below the skin and you don’t want to peel it off.
Cut the gobo into 5 inches (12 cm), and then cut each piece in half. If it’s a very thick piece, you can cut that piece in half again.
Add 1 tsp rice vinegar (1 tsp) in the water (4 cups, 960ml). Soak gobo in vinegar water for 3 minutes so the gobo retains its color. Drain and set aside.
To Cook Gobo
Add gobo in the saucepan filled with water (4 cups, 960 ml). Bring it to a boil. Once boiling, lower the heat to medium and cook for 13-15 minutes, or until the gobo is tender but firm. Drain gobo and transfer to the cutting board.
To Dress with Sesame Sauce
Pound gobo with the pestle (surikogi or a rolling pin from end to end until the fibers are smashed. This allows the sauce to go through the fibers of the gobo. Then cut them in half (2.5 inches/6 cm pieces).
While gobo is still hot, transfer into the sesame sauce and coat well. Gobo can absorb the flavors when they are hot.

Using your hand, mix the ingredients and knead well until well combined.
Add sake a little bit at a time to combine with the sake lee mixture. See the consistency to see if you need to add more sake. Each sake lee brand may have a different consistency and you may not need all of sake (or you may need more). The consistency you’re looking for is similar to miso, not too loose not too hard.
Knead until kasudoko becomes paste form and then transfer to a glass container where you want to pickle your ingredients.
To Make Cucumber Kasuzuke

Sprinkle salt over cucumbers. The amount of salt used is 2% of the weight of cucumber. Here I use 500 grams of cucumbers; therefore, I’ll need 10 grams of salt. Using hands, rub the salt into the cucumbers.
Set aside for 1 hour. Salt will draw moisture from the cucumbers.
After 1 hour, dry the moisture on the cucumbers with a paper towel. And transfer the cucumbers into the misodoko.
Completely cover the cucumbers with misodoko.
Once the cucumbers are embedded, cover the container with the lid. Store in the refrigerator for half day (maximum 24 hours).

Day 1
Combine 1 cup water and 1 Tbsp salt and mix well. Peel daikon.
Cut the daikon in half widthwise and half in lengthwise. If your daikon is thinner, you may just cut in half widthwise.
Put the daikon in a resealable plastic bag and add saltwater. Remove air and seal tightly. Daikon has strong-smelling sulfur compounds and it gets quite smelly. If you decide not to use a resealable plastic bag, you will need a large airtight container such as a big jar that can include daikon, saltwater, and heavy objects on top of the daikon.
Put the bag in a tray to avoid any leakage and put a heavy object on top of the bag. Here I put a plate (to evenly distribute the weight) and pie weights. Set aside at room temperature overnight.
Day 2
To make Shio Koji Mixture, combine ½ cup shio koji and ¼ cup sugar in a 1-cup measuring cup (or bowl). Cut off the end of red chili pepper with a knife or a pair of scissors.
Take out and discard the seeds (typically, the Japanese do not include seeds and use just the pod for mild spiciness). Cut the red chili pepper into small rounds and add to the mixture.
Cut the kombu into thin strips and add to the mixture. Mix all together. Set aside.
Remove the heavy objects, and take out the daikon. Discard the salt water.
Wipe off the moisture on the daikon with a paper towel.
In an airtight container that fits the daikon, pour half of your Shio Koji Mixture on the bottom of the container. Put the daikon on top.
Add and distribute the rest of the mixture. Put the lid on and keep at the room temperature for 2-3 hours, then transfer to the refrigerator for 2-3 days.
When to Stop Pickling
You can start eating from the day you add Shio Koji Mixture. It’s up to you when you want to stop pickling. You can take out all the daikon after 1 day, for example. As time passes, moisture comes out more form the daikon and it gets slimy from kombu. When the daikon is pickled enough (to your liking), take them out and transfer to another airtight container to keep for a week or two. I usually take out and eat one daikon each day and finish all of it by the 3rd day.
To Serve
If you prefer to serve pickled daikon without koji (grain), you can quickly rinse under running water. Cut the daikon into ¼ inch (6 mm) slices and enjoy!

Heat the oil in the pot. Add the taro and quickly coat with the oil. The oil helps lock in all the flavors inside the taro and prevent umami from going away. It also helps to keep the shape without breaking into pieces.
Add dashi, sake and sugar, and bring to boil. Skim if necessary.
Lower the heat and place otoshibuta (drop lid) and simmer for 5 minutes.

Rinse the rice under cold water, by gently rubbing the rice with your fingertips in a circling motion. Submerge the rice in water and pour out the starchy water.
Rinse and repeat until the water becomes clear. Soak rice in water for 20-30 minutes. It's a must!
Here's how the rice looks before and after soaking for 20 minutes.
Drain water completely. Set aside for 10 minutes. If you don’t have time to wait, then shake off the excess water the best you can.
Transfer drained rice and measured the amount of water in the inner pot of the Instant Pot.
Make sure the rice is evenly distributed and flat. Close the lid.
Set HIGH pressure for 2 minutes. Make sure the steam release handle points at “sealing” and not “venting.” The float valve goes up when pressurized (it takes roughly 5 minutes to pressurize). When it’s finished cooking, the Instant Pot will switch automatically to the “Keep Warm” mode. Let the pressure release naturally for 10 minutes and then proceed with quick release (DO NOT EXCEED MORE THAN 10 MINS. I recommend setting a timer.) by turning the steam release handle to the “venting” position to let steam out until the float valve drops down. Hold a kitchen towel and do not place your hand or face over steam release valve. The steam should be left only a little bit after 10 minutes of natural release.
Fluff the rice with a rice scooper and serve warm.

In a small bowl, combine 2 Tbsp miso, 1 tsp sugar, and 1 Tbsp mirin and mix well. Depending on the type of miso, it might be saltier or sweeter than mine. Adjust the flavor by removing/adding sugar. Set the sauce aside for brushing the rice balls later.
For serving the rice ball, keep 6 shiso leaves aside (they will be placed under the rice ball later). Roll up the rest of shiso leaves and cut into julienned strips.
Add shiso leaves and roasted white sesame seeds in the bowl of steamed rice. Using a rice scooper, fluff up the rice while you mix in shiso leaves and sesame seeds.
Prepare a small bowl of water and a plate of kosher salt, roughly 2 to 3 tsp. Wet your palms with water, dip your fingers into the salt and rub some of the salt lightly onto your palms. Then using a rice scooper, scoop 1/6 portion of the steamed rice (you should be able to make 6 rice balls).
Gently form the rice into a ball shape, and then flatten top and bottom. It should look like a thick disk shape.
Cut the parchment paper to fit the bottom of your frying pan and place it on the pan. Brush the oil on the parchment paper. Place the rice balls and start cooking on medium heat. Make sure to keep some distance between rice balls so they don’t stick to each other.

Increase the marinate ingredients if you cook more than 4 eggs.
In a resealable plastic bag, combine soy sauce, mirin, and water. Tip 1: If you plan to make the ramen eggs in just a few hours of marinating, use 0-1 Tbsp water. Otherwise, start with 2-3 Tbsp water and taste before adding more water. You have to adjust the saltiness to your taste and how long you plan to marinade. Tip 2: To use the minimal amount of the condiments (as we have to discard after marinating), I use a plastic bag. If you use a container, you will need to double the amount of condiment to cover the eggs.
Bring water to a boil in a medium saucepan. There should be enough water to cover the eggs (should be 1 inch above eggs).
When boiling, take out the eggs from the refrigerator and carefully and slowly submerge the eggs into the boiling water with a mesh strainer/skimmer or ladle to prevent the eggs from cracking.
Immediately reduce heat to maintain a simmer (gentle boil) and cook the eggs for exactly 7 minutes. [Runny egg yolk - 6 to 6 ½ minutes. Custard-like egg yolk but not runny - 8 to 9 minutes.] Make sure the water is simmering, but not so hot that the eggs bounce around. If you want your egg yolk to be in the center, gently rotate the eggs with chopsticks once in a while for the first 3 minutes so the egg yolk will be in the center.
After 7 minutes, immediately take out the eggs and soak in the ice bath to stop them from cooking further. Let them cool for 3 minutes.
The soft boiled eggs are not completely hardened so gently peel the eggs.
Put the eggs in the sauce bag and close tightly. The eggs should be submerged in the marinade. Let them marinate overnight to up to 3-4 days in the refrigerator.
Take out the eggs and cut in halves to serve. Enjoy the eggs by themselves or use them as a ramen topping.
To Store
Keep the eggs in the refrigerator all the time. Enjoy the eggs within 4 days if your eggs are soft-boiled. If your eggs are hard-boiled, you can keep in the refrigerator for up to a week.

To Separate Watermelon Flesh and Rind
Cut the watermelon into 1-inch slices. Then cut each watermelon slice into 1-inch sticks.
Cut each of the watermelon stick crosswise so the watermelon is 1-inch cubes. Tip: To add natural sweetness, I like to keep a little bit of red flesh attach to the white/green rind of the fruit.
Cut the rind into 1-inch thick sticks, too. We now have 8 cups (1034 g or 2.3 lb) of the watermelon rind with skin.

To Cook Rice
1 rice cooker cup (180 ml, 150 g) yields roughly 330 g of cooked rice, which is roughly 1 ¾ US cups. One sushi roll requires ½ - ¾ cup (90-135 g) of sushi rice.
Put rice in a large bowl. Rinse the rice and discard the water immediately. Rice absorbs water very quickly when you start washing, so don't let the rice absorb the unclear water. Repeat this process 1-2 times.
Now use your fingers to gently wash the rice by moving in a circular motion.
Rinse and discard water. Repeat this process 3-4 times.
Repeat the rinsing process 3-4 times until the water is almost clear.
Transfer the rice into a sieve and drain completely.
Gently wipe the dashi kombu with a damp cloth (it's a traditional method but these days kombu is much cleaner). DO NOT wipe off the white powdery substances, which contribute to the umami flavor in dashi. NEVER wash the kombu.
Put the rice in the rice cooker bowl and add water (never hot or warm!) to just under the 3-cup line. If your rice cooker has a ""Sushi Rice"" mode, add water till that line. Place the kombu on top of the rice, soak rice in water for 20-30 minutes, and start cooking. If you don't have a rice cooker, cook rice in a pot over the stove, an instant pot, or a donabe. Tip: Since you add sushi vinegar to the cooked rice, the rice should be cooked a little bit on the firm side and the water to rice ratio for sushi rice should be 1 to 1 (instead of 1 to 1.1 or 1 to 1.2 for regular steamed rice).
To Make Sushi Vinegar
To make sushi vinegar, combine rice vinegar, sugar, and salt in a small saucepan and bring it to a boil over medium-high heat. Whisk until the sugar is completely dissolved. You can also put the ingredients in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave for 1 minute, or till sugar is dissolved. Set aside to let it cool.
To Make Sushi Rice
When the rice is cooked, moisten sushi oke/hangiri (a round, flat-bottom wooden tub) or a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, or a large moisten glass bowl. Transfer the cooked rice into the sushi oke and spread out evenly so the rice will cool faster. While it’s hot, pour sushi vinegar over the rice. Tip: If you're making more/less rice or using the sushi vinegar bottle, the required sushi vinegar for rice should be roughly 8-10% of the cooked rice weight.
With a rice paddle, slice the rice at a 45 degree to separate the chunks of rice instead of mixing. At the same time, you need to use a fan to cool rice so the rice will shine and doesn't get mushy.
Then gently flip the rice in between slices. Repeat this process until the rice is cooled to the temperature of human skin.
To Keep
Keep the rice covered with a damp towel (or paper towel) at the room temperature until ready to use.
To Store
Rice gets hard and dry in the refrigerator. Therefore, my recommendation (even you plan to use it soon) is to put sushi rice in an airtight container and store in the freezer for up to a month. You can defrost overnight in the fridge or microwave, but bring it to room temperature (not hot). If you really want to refrigerate, cover the container with a thick kitchen towel, so the rice will stay cool and safe, but not become cold.",en-US,{},4.58,,Just One Cookbook,100,5 serving(s)

Add ¼ cup (50 g) short-grain rice in a bowl and rinse under running water while gently rubbing the rice with hands. Repeat until the water runs clear and drain.
Put the rice back in a donabe (I used a small Japanese earthenware pot) or a heavy-bottomed pot, add 250 ml of water, and cover with a lid. Soak the rice for at least 30 minutes. Tip: With the heavy-bottomed pot like a donabe, the heat is distributed not as strongly/directly as a regular pot, so you can cook rice evenly.
Bring the rice to a boil over medium-high heat. You can open the lid to check during this time.
As soon as it's boiling, gently mix with the spoon once, making sure rice is not stuck to the bottom of the pot. Then lower the heat to the stove’s lowest heat setting (make sure to use the right size of stove burner for your pot size), cover the lid, and simmer the rice for 25-30 minutes. During this time, don't open the lid or mix the rice (See Note).
After 25-30 minutes, turn off the heat and set aside for 10 minutes to let it steam. The rice should be soft and thickened.

To Prepare Rice and Cherry Blossoms
Rinse the rice under cold water until it’s almost clear. Add mochi mugi to the rice (read the instruction of the package to see if it’s necessary to rinse). Let the rice soak in water for 30 minutes, and then drain water completely over a sieve.
Put 12 salt-pickled cherry blossoms in a bowl. Add water and gently rinse off the salt from the flowers. Discard the water and add new water.
Let the flowers soak for 5 minutes. Then gently pick up 6 nicest looking flowers and lay them on a plate.
Pick up the rest of flowers as well as broken pieces and squeeze the water out.
Chop the flowers finely. You should get about 1 teaspoon.
To Cook Rice
Now transfer the well-drained rice and mochi mugi into the rice cooker, add water until the 1-cup line (200 ml). Then evenly distribute the chopped flowers over the rice. Press “start” to cook the rice.
Once the rice is done cooking, add 2 tsp white sesame seeds and fluff the rice with a rice scooper. Roughly divide the rice into 6 equal portions.
To Make Rice Balls
First wet both of your hands with water in order to keep the rice from sticking to your hands. Gently tap 2-3 finger tips in kosher salt and rub to spread all around your palms (Why using salt? Please read Notes below). If you are using table salt, use half the amount as it is saltier than kosher salt.
Scoop out one portion into one hand. Then mold the rice with your hands by pressing it down gently to form a barrel shape (or any shape you like).

Overfill the plastic rice cooker cup (180 ml) and level off. In this recipe, I'm using my 2 rice-cup-size Kamado-san. You can also use a 3 rice-cup size Kamado-san.
To Rinse Rice
First, add water just enough till it submerges all the rice in the bowl. Then discard the water immediately. Repeat this process 2-3 times. Tip: Rice absorbs water very quickly when you start rinsing, so don't let the rice absorb the first few rounds of water.
Use your fingers to gently wash the rice in a circular motion for 10-15 seconds. Add water and discard the water. Repeat this process 2 times.
Now use your fingers to gently wash the rice in a circular motion for 5 seconds. Add water and discard it. Repeat this process 2 more times.
When the water is almost clear, drain well. Use a fine-mesh sieve to drain and shake off excess water.
To Add Water
Transfer rinsed rice to the donabe and add 400 ml of water. Gently shake the pot to flatten the rice and distribute the rice evenly in the pot.
[White Rice Water Amount]
1 Rice Cooker Cup: 200 ml, 2 Cups: 400 ml, 3 Cups: 600, 4 Cups: 800 ml, 5 cups: 1000 ml.
[Brown Rice Water Amount]
1 Rice Cooker Cup: 300-320 ml, 2 Cups: 570-600 ml, 3 Cups: 900 ml, 4 Cups: 1200 ml.
To Soak Rice
Place the lid (or both lids of Kamado-san) and soak the rice in the donabe for 20-30 minutes. If you're cooking brown rice, it requires 12 hours of soaking time. You can also add a pinch of salt to help reduce bitterness of rice (optional).
To Cook Rice
Set the donabe on the gas stovetop and turn the heat to medium-high (or medium for the professional stove). Cook for 14 minutes (or see the following cooking time for your rice cups) or turn off the heat 2 minutes after the steam starts puffing from the lid's hole for white rice.

To Prepare Steamed Rice
You can also cook short-grain rice with a rice cooker, an instant pot, or a donabe.
Put the rice in a large bowl and gently wash the rice in a circular motion and discard the water. Repeat this process about 3-4 times.
Let the rice soak in water for 30 minutes. Transfer the rice into a sieve and drain completely, at least 15 minutes.
Combine the rice and water in a heavy-bottom pot. A heavy-bottom pot with a tight-fitting lid is recommended as it is thicker at the base so it absorbs and distributes heat better. Cover the lid and bring it to a boil over medium heat.
Once water is boiling, turn the heat to the lowest setting and continue to cook covered for 12 to 13 minutes, or until the water is completely absorbed. At 12-13 minute mark, take a quick peek and if you see there is any water left, close the lid and continue cooking for another minute or so.
Remove the pot (with the lid on) from the heat and let it steam for another 10 minutes. Then transfer the rice to a large plate or baking sheet lined with parchment paper (I use Sushi Oke). Fluff the rice with a rice scooper. Let the cooked rice cool a little bit until you can hold rice without burning your hands. However, do not let the rice completely cool down.
To Prepare Onigiri Fillings
While rice is being soaked and drained (45 minutes), prepare the onigiri fillings.
Salted salmon filling: Sprinkle kosher salt on both sides of the salmon fillet. Bake at 425ºF (218ºC) in a toaster oven or oven for 10-20 minutes. Japanese salted salmon is cooked till well done (more dry and flaky).
Break the cooked salmon into flakes and set aside.
Umeboshi filling: Place umeboshi (Japanese pickled plums) on a 10” x 10” sheet of plastic wrap. Fold in half and squeeze the seed out from each umeboshi. Discard the seeds and keep the umeboshi flesh.
Okaka filling: Put katsuobushi (dried bonito flakes) in a bowl and add 2 Tbsp soy sauce. Mix to combine. Katsuobushi should be moistened but not drenched in soy sauce.
Tuna mayo filling: Put drained canned tuna in a bowl and add 2 Tbsp Japanese mayonnaise and ½ Tbsp soy sauce. Mix to combine.
Seasoned kombu filling: Put the purchased seasoned kombu in a bowl for easy access later.
To Make Onigiri
Cut the nori sheets in thirds (⅓).
First, wet both of your hands with water in order to prevent the rice from sticking to your hands.
Then put some salt in your hands and rub to spread all around your palms. How much salt? I dip 3 finger tips in kosher salt shown in the picture below. If you are using table salt, use half amount as it’s saltier than kosher salt.
Scoop out a handful of warm rice (about ⅓ cup) into one hand. Create a small well (indentation) in the center of the rice. Put one kind of filling (about 1-2 tsp) inside. Then mold the rice with your hands around the well to cover your filling completely.
Press the rice around the filling to gently form the rice into a triangle. I use three fingers (thumb, index finger, middle finger) to make a triangle corner. Your hands should be just firm enough so the onigiri doesn't fall apart. You don't want to squeeze the rice too tight.
Wrap the onigiri with nori seaweed.
Place a little bit of each filling on top of onigiri so we know which kind it is.
Alternative Method of Making Onigiri
If you do not want to touch the rice at all, you can place a piece of plastic wrap in a rice bowl (or any small bowl) and put the rice on top. Sprinkle some kosher salt (remember, salt is used to preserve the rice for a long time here).
Pull the plastic wrap corners and twist a few times.
Form into a triangle shape with the same manner as I described above.
To Store
Onigiri (or any rice dish) gets hard when you refrigerate. The cold air makes the rice dry and hard (which is perfect for fried rice!). I don't recommend making onigiri ahead of time. But if you really need to, my trick is to wrap the onigiri with thick kitchen towels and store in the fridge.

Make dashi if you don’t have it around already and let it cool to room temperature (you can place the pot with dashi in it over a bowl of iced water).
To Prepare Rice
In a large bowl, measure and add 2 rice measuring cups (360 ml). Rinse the rice under cold water, by gently rubbing the rice with your fingertips in a circling motion. Submerge the rice in water and pour out the starchy water. Rinse and repeat until the water becomes clear. Soak rice in water for 20-30 minutes. Meanwhile, start preparing the ingredients.
Here's how the rice looks before and after soaking for 20 minutes. Drain water completely. Set aside for 10 minutes. If you don’t have time to wait, then shake off the excess water the best you can.
To Prepare Ingredients
In a small bowl, add dried shiitake mushrooms and ¼ cup water. Put a heavy object on top so the shiitake mushrooms will be submerged under water. Let them soaked till tender or while you prep other ingredients.
Cut the chicken thigh into slanted, smaller bite-sized pieces. I use “Sogigiri” Japanese cutting technique to create more surface so it will cook faster. Add ½ Tbsp sake to remove any unwanted smell from the chicken.
Peel gobo skin with the back of a knife. You don’t use a vegetable peeler to peel gobo’s skin because the earthy delicious flavor is just right below the skin and you don’t want to peel it off. Cut the gobo in half lengthwise.
Thinly slice each half diagonally. Soak the gobo in water to prevent it from turning brown and to remove any astringent taste.
Cut the carrot in half lengthwise and thinly slice diagonally.
Pour hot water over aburaage to get rid of the excess oil. Some people skip this step as the oil is cleaner these days. I do it anyway. Cut in half lengthwise.
Cut the tofu pouch into thin slices and squeeze water out.
Roughly, you will need ⅓ cup each of sliced carrot, sliced gobo, and sliced aburaage.
By now shiitake mushrooms should be hydrated and tender. Squeeze them to remove the excess liquid in the bowl. We will use this reserved liquid “Shiitake Dashi”. Remove the stem from each shiitake mushrooms.
Thinly slice the mushrooms. If it’s a big mushroom, cut the slices in half.
In a 2-cup measuring cup, add 2 Tbsp shiitake dashi (the reserved liquid from hydrating shiitake mushrooms). If you are worried about small particles that are left in the liquid, you can strain the liquid using a tea strainer. Then in the same measuring cup, add 1 ½ Tbsp soy sauce, 1 Tbsp mirin, and ½ tsp salt.
Lastly, add dashi so that the seasoning is 360 ml.
In a large bowl, add chicken, shiitake mushrooms, carrot, gobo, aburaage, and the seasoning from the previous step. Mix well.
To Cook Rice
Transfer drained rice and make sure the rice is evenly distributed and flat.
Add the ingredients and seasoning liquid on top of the rice. DO NOT MIX rice and the ingredients. Try to evenly distribute the ingredients and flatten without mixing with rice.
Close the lid and click MANUAL. Set HIGH pressure for 2 minutes.
Make sure the steam release handle points at “sealing” and not “venting.” The float valve goes up when pressurized (it takes roughly 10 minutes to pressurize).
When it’s finished cooking, the Instant Pot will beep and switch automatically to the “Keep Warm” mode. Let the pressure release naturally for 10 minutes (10-minute natural release) and then proceed with a quick release by turning the steam release handle to the “venting” position to let steam out until the float valve drops down. DO NOT EXCEED MORE THAN 10 MINS. I recommend setting a timer. When you do a quick release, hold a kitchen towel and do not place your hand or face over steam release valve. The steam should be left only a little bit after 10 minutes of natural release.
Fluff the rice with a rice scooper immediately to avoid burning the rice on the bottom. Instead of “mixing”, try to “cut” the rice at a 45 degrees angle as you fluff.
Cut the mitsuba into small pieces. If you don’t have mitsuba, you can use green onion.

Put the beans in the inner pot of Instant Pot. Add 4 cups of water to the pot and let them soak for 4 hours (or overnight, depending on your package instruction).
To make the black soybeans even darker, we cook the black soybeans with rusty iron nails in Japan (Read more in the blog post). If you use rusty iron nails, clean 2-3 nails, wrap in a cheesecloth and add in the pot. Optionally, you can purchase purchase “Lucky Iron Fish"" on Amazon and place it in the water.
To Cook the Black Soybeans in Instant Pot
After 4 hours of soaking, put the inner pot back to the Instant Pot (keep the iron fish in the pot). Add 1 cup sugar, 2 ½ tsp soy sauce, and ½ tsp kosher salt. Mix well.
Close the lid and set HIGH pressure for 15 minutes (It will take 10 minutes to pressurize). Make sure the steam release handle points at “sealing” and not “venting”. The float valve goes up when pressurized.
Once Pressure Cooking Is Done...
When it’s finished cooking, the Instant Pot will switch automatically to the “Keep Warm” mode. Let the pressure release naturally, about 45 minutes. Open the lid and take out the inner pot and remove the iron fish.
Pour the beans and sauce into a large airtight container. Let the beans cool uncovered.
To Store
Kuromame are ready to eat, but to yield a more striking black color, let the beans soak in the sauce for at least a day. Cover and refrigerate. You can keep for up to a week in the refrigerator, or 1 month in the freezer.
To Serve
Drain the liquid and serve the kuromame. If you like to make it more festive, you can put gold leaf on top.

After 30 minutes or so, squeeze the liquid out from the shiitake mushrooms.
Cut the shiitake mushrooms into a hexagon, which represents turtle shape for longevity.
Strain the liquid through a fine-mesh sieve. This is called shiitake dashi. It yields roughly ¾ cup.
Chicken
Remove extra fat of the chicken and cut into 1 ½ inch (3.8 cm) pieces.
Transfer the chicken in a medium bowl and add ½ Tbsp sake and ½ Tbsp soy sauce. Coat the chicken with the marinade and set aside.
Burdock Root (Gobo)
Scrape the skin off the burdock root with the back of the knife. After rinsing, cut it into thin slices.
Prepare a bowl of 2 cups water and ½ Tbsp vinegar. Soak the burdock root in the water for 15 minutes.
Japanese Taro Roots (Satoimo)
Cut off the ends of taro. Then peel from one end to the other.
Ideally, taro should be a hexagon (6 sides) from the side view.
Cut the taro in half and soak in water. You can rub them with salt to get rid of the sliminess if that bothers you.
Bamboo Shoot
Cut the bamboo shoot into quarters lengthwise.
Cut the bamboo shoot in half widthwise. If each piece is still bigger than bite-size, you can cut in half.
Lotus Roots (Renkon)
Cut the lotus root into Hana Renkon.
The lotus root should resemble flowers after cutting the edges off.
Cut them into ⅛ inch (3 mm) slices. Prepare a bowl of 2 cups water and ½ Tbsp vinegar. Soak the lotus root in the water for 15 minutes.
Carrot (Nejiri Ume)
Peel the carrot and cut into ½ inch (1.3 cm) pieces.
Use a flower-shaped vegetable cutter and cut out each piece into a flower shape. Then make a shallow (roughly ¼ inch deep) incision from the center of the flower to in-between the two petals.
Hold a knife parallel to one petal and make a diagonal cut from right to left in-between petals.
This is called Nejiri Ume.
Konnyaku
Cut konnyaku into ¼ inch (6 mm) slices and then make a 1 ½ inch (3.8 cm) incision in the middle.
Put one end of konnyaku into the hole in the middle and pull it out. This is called Tazuna Konnyaku.
Snow Peas
Pull the strings at the seams of the snow peas and discard them. These are tough and not edible.
To Blanch Vegetables and Konnyaku
Boil water in a saucepan and blanch half of the flower carrot for 2 minutes and set aside.
Add a pinch of salt and blanch the snow pea pods for 30-60 seconds, until crisp but tender enough to eat.
Remove the snow peas from the water and transfer to the ice water to stop cooking and set aside.
In the same boiling water, add konnyaku. After boiling again, cook for 2-3 minutes to remove the smell.
Diagonally cut the blanched snow peas in half and set aside.
To Make Chikuzenni
In the large pot, heat 1 Tbsp of sesame oil over medium heat. When it’s hot, add the chicken.
Cook the chicken until it turns white. Transfer the chicken to a plate.
Add ½ Tbsp sesame oil and cook all the ingredients except the blanched snow peas and carrots reserved for decoration.
Stir and coat the ingredients with sesame oil.
Add dashi and shiitake dashi.
Bring it to a simmer over medium heat. Skim off the fat and scum that accumulates on the surface.
Add sake, mirin, sugar, soy sauce, and salt.
Add the chicken back into the pot. Bring it to a simmer. As you see, the stock should cover about 80% of the ingredients.
Put an otoshibuta (drop lid) on the ingredients and cook for 10 minutes. If you don't have one, you can make an Otoshibuta with aluminum foil.
Remove Otoshibuta and cook for another 10 minutes.
Insert a bamboo skewer into tough vegetables (taro root and lotus root) and see if they are tender. Taste and adjust seasonings if needed.

To Store
Keep the leftovers in an airtight container and store it in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.

For Japanese short-grain rice, the ideal rice to water ratio is 1 : 1.1 (or 1.2), which is 10-20% more water. For easy American ""cup"" measurement, I used 25% in this recipe (rice to water ratio is 1 : 1.25). If you have a precise milliliter measuring cup or kitchen scale, use the following measurement. 200 ml water for 1 rice cooker cup (180 ml). 400 ml water for 2 rice cooker cups (360 ml). 600 ml water for 3 rice cooker cups (540 ml). 800 ml water for 4 rice cooker cups (720 ml). 1000 ml water for 5 rice cooker cups (900 ml).
Put rice in a large bowl. Rice absorbs water very quickly when you start washing, so don't let the rice absorb the unclear water. Gently wash the rice in a circular motion and discard the water. Repeat this process about 3-4 times. Drain to a fine-mesh sieve and shake off excess water.
In a heavy-bottomed pot with a tight-fitting lid, put well-drained rice and measured water. Soak the rice for 20-30 minutes before cooking.
To Cook Rice
Close the lid and bring it to a boil over medium heat. Take a quick peek to see if water is boiling (otherwise do not open the lid).
Once water is boiling, turn the heat to low and cook covered for 12 to 13 minutes, or until the water is completely absorbed (take a quick peek!). If you see there is water left, close the lid and continue cooking for a little longer.
Remove the pot (with the lid on) from the heat source and let it steam for another 10 minutes.
Fluff the rice with a rice paddle when it’s done.

Once boiling, reduce heat to medium (or even lower heat to maintain the boil). Cook the potatoes until tender, about 15 minutes (I usually cover the lid, slightly ajar, so water won't evaporate too fast.
Meanwhile, in a saucepan, heat the butter, heavy cream, and shio koji over medium-low heat. Turn off the heat and set aside to keep warm (you may need to reheat before adding to the potatoes).
When a skewer goes through the potato easily, turn off the heat. Drain the water completely.
Rinse under hot running water and drain. Repeat 1-2 times to wash away excess starch. Drain really well.
Put the pot back on the stove and let them dry for a few minutes on low heat. With a stainless steel potato masher, mash the potatoes until you have a creamy and even mash.
Pour the warm butter mixture over the mash and fold gently with a silicone spatula to combine.
Season to taste with freshly ground black pepper and salt (if you are not using Shio Koji). Transfer to a serving bowl.

For this recipe, I use a 3-cup size double-lid donabe rice cooker called Kamado-san.
To Make Fish Broth
Note: The fish broth can be made a day ahead and refrigerated. With a spoon, remove the inside of the fish head. Keep the main fish bones for the broth, but discard any tiny bones, the fins, and the tail.
Place the fish bones and head in a medium/large pot and fill up the pot with water, just to cover them.
Bring the water to a boil over medium heat. Once boiling, skim the foam and scrum with a fine-mesh skimmer. Lower the heat and simmer for 10-15 minutes while skimming occasionally. We want clean broth for the rice.
After 10 minutes of simmering, strain the bones and broth over a fine-mesh strainer placed over a large bowl or another pot. Discard the bones and head, and let the broth cool to room temperature.
To Make Tai Meshi
Rinse the short-grain rice (If you are not sure how to rinse rice, see this post) and drain well. Transfer to a donabe (I use a Kamado-san) or a medium pot.
In a 2-cup measuring cup, add soy sauce and sake first. Then pour the fish broth until the amount is 400 ml (should be 1 ¾ cup minus 1 Tbsp).
Add salt and mix well together. Then transfer to the donabe (pot).
Flatten the rice and add a piece of kombu on top. Put the lid on (for Kamadosan, put internal and external lids). Let the rice soak in the broth for 20-30 minutes.
Cook on medium-high heat (or medium heat on a professional gas stove) for 13-15 minutes.
If you are using a Kamado-san, remove from the heat 2-3 minutes after the steam starts puffing from the top lid (see left pic below). Each gas stove is different, so this is a good sign to follow. Let it stand for 20 minutes, without opening the lid.
To Serve
Shave off the skin of ginger with a knife and cut it into thin slices. Then cut it into thin julienned pieces.
Break the fish meat into smaller bite-size pieces. If the fish was in the fridge, you may want to reheat it in the microwave. Open the lid (double lids, if using Kamado-san).
Remove the kombu (you can discard or re-use it to make simmered kombu) and gently fluff the rice with a rice paddle.
Add half of the fish meat and julienned ginger and mix gently. Then transfer the rest of the fish meat to the rice. Garnish with the rest of the ginger on top. Serve into individual bowls and sprinkle some sansho pepper if you like. Enjoy!

In a medium saucepan, bring 2 cups (480 ml) water to boil and add ½ tsp kosher salt.
Add green peas and cook for 4 minutes, or until the peas are firm but tender (eat one and you’ll see). Remove from the heat and let the peas cool in the cooking liquid. This will prevent from getting wrinkles.
Once the peas are cooled down, reserve 1 cup (240 ml) of cooking liquid.
In a rice cooker bowl, put rice that has been drained well. Then add 1 cup of the reserved liquid. Add water to the rice cooker’s 2 cup line. Add ½ Tbsp sake and ½ tsp kosher salt and mix well.
