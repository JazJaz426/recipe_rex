To Make Shabu Shabu
Bring a medium pot of water to a boil. Once boiling, add 2 Tbsp sake and ½ tsp salt and reduce the heat to low heat/simmer.
One slice at a time, cook the pork loin in the simmering water until no longer pink. Do not overcook. As soon as the color changes, take it out.
Transfer to a plate lined with a paper towel. Continue with the rest of the meat. Try not to put all the meat at once. It will overcook and the meat slices clump together. Let cool at the counter until the meat is at room temperature, then transfer to the refrigerator to chill.
To Make Dressing
Please Note: If you increase the amount of salad or like to pour more dressing, you may want to double the recipe. The dressing ingredients are measured for the exact amount for this recipe. Peel the skin of ginger and grate until you have ½ tsp of grated ginger.
In a small bowl, combine 2 Tbsp soy sauce, 2 Tbsp sesame oil, 2 Tbsp rice vinegar, and ½ tsp sugar.
And add ½ tsp grated ginger, ¼ tsp freshly ground black pepper, and 1 tsp white sesame seeds.
Whisk together until sugar is completely dissolved. You can pour the dressing into a serving container (optional). You can keep this dressing for up to a week, if you want to make a lot ahead.
To Make Salad
Cut the mizuna into 2-inch pieces and put them into a large bowl.
Remove the core of the iceberg lettuce and then cut into julienned pieces.
Cut off the ends of the cucumber and cut it in half lengthwise. Then thinly slice the halves diagonally.
Thinly slice the onion against the grain. Then transfer to iced water and soak for 5 minutes to remove the bitterness and make the onion crisp.
Combine the mizuna, iceberg lettuce, cucumber, and onion in a large bowl and toss together. If you have time, chill for 30 minutes.
To Serve
Cut the tomato into wedges.
Serve the salad on a plate, topped with pork and tomatoes. Drizzle the dressing and enjoy! Optional: You can add pork and dressing in the bowl and toss all together before plating. This is my preferred serving style; however, the classic Shabu Shabu Salad is typically constructed with layers of salad and pork, topped with the dressing.
To Store
You can prepare and store this dish ahead of time. Keep the salad, pork, and dressing separately until you're ready to serve. You can keep it for 24 hours. The dressing can be made ahead and kept in an airtight jar for up to a week.",en-US,{},4.41,,Just One Cookbook,55,4 serving(s)

Place a stainless steel steamer basket inside your pressure cooker (I use a 6QT Instant Pot) and add 1 cup of water.
In a small saucepan, place an egg and cover it with water. Bring it to boil with medium-high heat. Once boiling, reduce the heat to simmer and cook for 12 minutes.
When the egg is done, immediately discard the boiling water and cool the egg with cold water. Once the egg has cooled, remove the eggshell and mash the boiled egg in a small bowl with a fork.
While the egg is cooking, peel the potato skins and cut into 1 ½ inch (4 cm) pieces. They should be roughly about the same size so that they’ll be cooked at an equal rate. Remove starch by soaking the potatoes or if you don’t have any wait time, add them directly to the pressure cooker. By soaking the cut potatoes in water, it removes the starch and helps retain its colors.
Place the potatoes in the steamer basket inside the pressure cooker. Close lid and pressure cook at high pressure for 5 minutes. Make sure to turn the sealing vent to the “sealed” position. For Instant Pot, click “Steam” and set the cooking time to 5 minutes.
While the potatoes are cooking, prepare other ingredients. Cut the sliced hams into ¼ inch cubes.
Peel the carrot skin and slice using a mandolin slicer. Mandolin slicer will help you achieve very thin slices of carrot. If you don’t have one, simply slice the carrot into thin slices.
Peel the cucumber skin leaving some parts unpeeled. Use a mandolin to slice the cucumber or slice thinly with a knife.
Sprinkle ½ tsp kosher salt over carrot and cucumber and massages with hands. Wait for 10 minutes to let them dehydrate. Alternatively, you can blanch the sliced carrot (don't blanch cucumber) for 2-3 minutes until tender.
Quickly rinse under water, gently squeeze out water and set aside.
Once cooking completes, you can let the pressure valve release naturally (takes about 15-20 minutes) or manually release the pressure. Insert a wooden skewer in the center of a potato. If it goes through smoothly then the potatoes are ready. If the skewer gets stuck in the potato, cook for a bit longer. When the potatoes are done, take out the steam basket and transfer the potatoes to a bowl (I used suribachi – Japanese mortar here). Mash potatoes with a masher or a large fork (I used surikogi – Japanese pestle here – my mom’s method). Don’t crush the potatoes completely, leave some small chunks for texture.
Season the mashed potato with ½ tsp kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper.
Add 2 tsp rice vinegar and mix all together. Set aside to let cool.
Add eggs, cucumbers, carrots, and ham to the mashed potato and mix all together.
Add 4 Tbsp mayonnaise and combine well. Taste the potato salad first before adding more mayonnaise or salt.
Mix all the ingredients together. Serve at room temperature or cover the potato salad with plastic and let it chill in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour.

To Prepare Shrimp
Devein shrimp if not done so already. Keep the shell on while cooking so the flavors will be kept inside the shell. Sprinkle some potato or corn starch and coat the shrimp. It will absorb the smell and dirty particles from the shrimp. Rinse the shrimp under running water.
Add ⅓ cup sake in the frying pan and bring it to a boil.
Add the shrimp in a single layer and cover the lid.
Cook for 2-3 minutes depending on the size. Turn over half way.
Once the shrimp is no longer opaque, take it out on a plate and let cool. Save the remaining juice from cooking shrimp in a bowl.
To Make the Marinade
Combine ½ cup olive oil, ¼ cup rice vinegar, 2 Tbsp mirin, 1 tsp salt, freshly ground black pepper, and ½ Tbsp juice from cooking shrimp. Whisk well and taste. Adjust with salt if necessary. Set aside.
To Prepare the Rest of Ingredients
Thinly slice the boiled octopus as much as you can so it’s less chewy. Cut the celery into smaller pieces.
Cut the bell peppers into smaller pieces. I like to use Japanese “rangiri” cutting style where you cut the vegetables diagonally as you rotate them 90 degrees. This creates a more unique and random cut, creating more surface space.
Thinly slice the red onion and carrot. And cut the thin slabs of carrot into halves.
Thinly slice the red radishes and cut the cherry tomatoes in halves.
Mince the parsley and thinly slice the lemon.
Shrimp must be cool by now. Peel the shell and remove the tails.

To Prepare the Steak
Let the steak sit at room temperature for 30 minutes.
Pat dry the steak with a paper towel. Sprinkle both sides (and the edges) generously with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper.
Heat the olive oil in a cast-iron pan on high heat. I usually use a silicone brush to apply the oil. Sear the steak in the pan, about 3-4 minutes each side. During this time, do not move the steak around or flip. You can use tongs to press down so the steak gets nice sear marks.
Remove the steak from the heat and let it rest on a cutting board for 10 minutes. If you cut the meat right away, all the juice will come out. Cut thin slices, against the grain of the meat.

To store the leftover tofu, keep it in an airtight container and pour water until it covers the tofu. Keep in the refrigerator (change the water every day) and use it within a few days.
To Prepare Tofu
Do not skip this step. You don’t want to drain the water from tofu completely, but it’s important to remove some moisture so the dressing doesn’t get too wet. Wrap the tofu with paper towels.
Put the wrapped tofu on a tray or plate. Add another tray or plate on top of the tofu and put a heavy object on top to facilitate draining. Set aside for 30 minutes.
To Prepare Green Beans
Bring a big pot of water to a boil. Tear off the ends of green beans.
Boil green beans until crisp-tender (please don’t overcook).
Drain well and set aside.
Cut the green beans diagonally into 2-inch (5 cm) pieces.
Pour the soy sauce and toss together. Set aside for later.
To Prepare Sesame Seeds
Toast the sesame seeds in a frying pan, shaking the pan frequently, until they are fragrant and started to pop. Transfer to a Japanese mortar (suribachi).
Grind sesame seeds with a pestle (surikogi).
To Make Tofu Dressing
Add sugar and miso.
Mix well until sugar and miso are incorporated into the ground sesame seeds.
Remove tofu from the paper towel. Break it into pieces with your hands and add to the sesame seed mixture.
Using a pestle, mash and grind the tofu until smooth or to your liking.
It’s important to taste the tofu and season with salt to taste. It should not be bland. Green beans will be added, so the tofu dressing should have good flavor at this stage.
Mix all together until smooth.
To Assemble
Be sure to shake off any excess soy sauce from the green beans first. Any liquid from the soy sauce will only dilute the dressing. Then add the seasoned green beans to the tofu dressing. Combine well.
Once combined, you can chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes before serving, or serve immediately.

To Make Japanese Mayonnaise
You can make my Homemade Japanese Mayonnaise or modify American mayonnaise with Mizkan Natural Rice Vinegar and sugar. For 4 Tbsp of American mayonnaise (I use Best Foods/Hellmann’s Mayonnaise), add ½ Tbsp rice vinegar and ¾ tsp sugar. Whisk until sugar dissolves.
To Boil Macaroni
Start boiling 3 quarts (12 cups, 2.8 L) water in a large pot (I used a 3.5 QT pot). Once boiling, add 1 Tbsp salt and macaroni. Cook according to the package instructions plus 1 minute more.
Drain the macaroni and transfer to a large bowl. While hot, add 2 tsp olive oil.
Add 1 Tbsp rice vinegar and 1 tsp sugar and mix well together. Set aside to let cool completely.
To Make Boiled Egg
In a medium saucepan, add water that covers 1 large egg and bring it to a boil over medium heat. Optional Tip: If you want your egg yolk to be in the center, gently rotate the eggs with chopsticks once in a while for the first 3 minutes so the egg yolk will be in the center.
Once boiling, turn the heat down to medium-low and set a timer for 12 minutes (9 minutes for soft boiled egg). Once it’s done cooking, bring the pot under running water to cool or immediately transfer to an iced bath.
Peel the egg and cut it into small pieces.
To Prepare Vegetables
Cut off the ends and peel the onion. Cut into thin slices along the grain.
Peel the cucumber skin, leaving some part unpeeled (so it looks nice) and cut off the ends.
Thinly slice the cucumber (or use a mandolin). Put the sliced cucumber and onion in a medium bowl.
Sprinkle 1 tsp salt and lightly massage with hand to evenly distribute the salt. Set aside for 5 minutes.
When you see the liquid in the bowl, give the sliced vegetables a quick rinse to remove the salt.
Squeeze water out and set aside.
Cut the ham into small pieces, roughly ⅛ inch thick, 2 inch long pieces and set aside.
To Assemble Macaroni Salad
When the macaroni is cool, add the ham and sliced cucumber and onion.
Mix well together and add the chopped boiled egg.
Add 4 Tbsp Japanese mayonnaise and ¼ tsp freshly ground black pepper. Mix all together.

To Prepare Roasted Cauliflower
Cut the cauliflower into quarters.

Rinse the cauliflower and drain well. Put it on a rimmed baking sheet. Drizzle olive oil all over the florets.
Season with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper and toss to combine with hands. Make sure each floret is coated with thin layer of oil (your hands get messy, but it makes great roasted cauliflower).
Roast in the oven for 17-20 minutes, or until edges are nicely caramelized and golden brown. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool.
To Prepare Miso Tahini Dressing
Mix tahini sauce really well before using. Combine 2 Tbsp Tahini Sauce, 4 Tbsp All-Purpose Miso Sauce, and 3 Tbsp rice vinegar in a small bowl or mason jar. All-Purpose Miso Sauce is sweetened. If you use regular miso instead, taste the dressing, and adjust the sweetness by adding sugar/honey to your liking. Each brand/type of miso has different saltiness and flavor. Make sure to taste your dressing (it should taste a bit stronger before combining with salad).
Whisk to combine or shake well. You can keep this dressing for up to a week in the refrigerator.
To Prepare Kale Salad
Thinly slice the red onion.
Grip the bottom of the stem with one hand and use the other hand to rip the leaves away from you, like this (Or, of course, you can use a knife to remove the leaf from stem). Tip: Sturdy kale stems can be chopped up and added to stir-fries.
Rinse in a colander, drain well, and chop the kale into smaller pieces (Rinse before chopping so all the good vitamins won't drain from kale).
Add the chopped kale and dressing in a bowl and toss to mix. Make sure that kale is well coated with dressing at this stage. Once you add cauliflower, you don't want to break them into smaller pieces.

Japanese Cucumber Salad with Sesame Soy Vinaigrette,Namiko Chen,https://www.justonecookbook.com/spiralized-cucumber-salad/,Japanese,https://www.justonecookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Spiralized-Cucumber-Salad-5312-I-1.jpg,"['1 Tbsp dried wakame seaweed', ""1 American cucumber ((for the best spiralizing result; you can use Japanese or Persian cucumbers if you're not spiralizing) )"", '¼ tsp kosher/sea salt (I use Diamond Crystal; Use half for table salt) ((for sprinkling on cucumber))', '3 Tbsp toasted white sesame seeds', '1 Tbsp soy sauce', '3 Tbsp rice vinegar', '2 tsp sugar']","Gather all the ingredients.
Cover and soak 1 Tbsp wakame in water until it softens and hydrates, about 5 minutes.
Grind 3 Tbsp toasted white sesame seeds in pestle and mortar (Japanese style is a wooden pestle and grooved mortar), keeping some seeds unground for some texture.
Add 2 tsp sugar, 1 Tbsp soy sauce, and 3 Tbsp rice vinegar and mix well. Set aside.
I usually like to make a striped pattern by alternately peeling a ½-inch-wide strip lengthwise, then leaving a strip of the skin intact. With this method, the cucumber slices have some decorative dark green accents and a little bit of extra crunchiness.
Center align the cucumber on the spiralizer and press firmly to secure both ends (For The Inspiralizer, set to ""Blade A"" for wide ribbons). If you don’t use a spiralizer, simply slice the cucumber into thin slices.
Spin the handle clockwise to spiralize. Using a kitchen shears or knife, cut the spiralized cucumber into shorter lengths.
Sprinkle kosher salt and give some gentle massage. Set aside for a few minutes.
Squeeze the excess moisture out and place in a bowl. Squeeze wakame and add to the bowl.
Before serving, Pour the sesame dressing over the cucumber and wakame, and mix well together. Serve in individual dishes or in a large serving bowl. Serve immediately.

I don’t recommend keeping it for a long time as moisture from the cucumber will dilute the dressing and the salad becomes more like pickles. If that’s okay, keep it in an airtight container and store it in the refrigerator for up to 2-3 days.",en-US,{},4.5,,Just One Cookbook,15,2 serving(s)

To make the dressing:
Toast sesame seeds in a frying pan (without oil) until fragrant, about 3-5 minutes. Swirl and shake the pan once in a while for even toasting. Transfer the toasted sesame seeds into your Japanese mortar and pestle. Grind the sesame seeds about half way (This adds texture to the dressing). If you don’t have a Japanese mortar and pestle, you can use a food processor or grind between your palms.
Combine the rice vinegar, mirin, sugar, and soy sauce, then mix in the toasted sesame seeds.
To cut the ingredients:
Remove the end of king oyster mushrooms and cut in half, about 2 inch (5 cm) long. Then cut it into slices.
Discard the stems from the shiitake mushrooms and cut into thin slices.
Cut off the bases of the enoki mushrooms, then separate with fingers.
Cut the base of shimeji mushrooms and separate with hands.
Discard the end of mizuna and cut the mizuna into pieces 2 inches (5 cm) long.
To cook the ingredients:
Heat the oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Add all the mushrooms.
Sautee the mushrooms and add the kosher salt. Then add the sake and cook covered for 2 min over medium-low heat.
Add the sesame dressing and toss to coat. Drizzle sesame oil and mix all together.
Right before turning off the heat, add the mizuna and quickly toss all together. Remaining heat will continue to cook, so don’t worry about mizuna being still raw. Transfer to a serving dish and serve hot.
