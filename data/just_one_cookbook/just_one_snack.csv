Fill a large heavy pot, Dutch oven, or deep fryer with 3-4 inches of oil (or enough oil to submerge hot dogs). Heat the oil over medium-high heat until a deep-fry thermometer reaches 320-340ºF (160-170ºC). I use this instant-read thermometer.
Pour the batter into a tall glass. Dip each hot dog into the batter, turning until completely coated. Let any excess batter drip off so that the hot dog is coated evenly.
Lower the hot dog into the hot oil. Immediately repeat with another hot dog. Cook until deep golden brown, about 3 minutes. Make sure to turn the corn dogs so that they get even color.

Lotus Root Chips (Renkon Chips),Namiko Chen,https://www.justonecookbook.com/renkon-chips/,Japanese,https://www.justonecookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Renkon-Chips-w600.jpg,"['1 lotus root (renkon) ((1 lotus root = 1/2 lb))', 'Rice vinegar ((see recipe below))', 'neutral-flavored oil (vegetable, canola, etc) ((for deep frying))', 'Himalayan Pink Salt ((or sea salt))', 'aonori (dried green seaweed) ((optional))']","Gather all the ingredients.
Rinse the renkon and either cut with knife or use a mandolin slider to make 1/8 inch thin slices (see below). I don’t peel off the renkon skin as it gives nice look but it’s up to you.
Add a few drops of rice vinegar and soak the sliced renkon in vinegar water for 5-10 minutes. Vinegar water will prevent the renkon from changing to a dark color.
Rinse and drain well.
And pat dry on paper towel – make sure to wipe off all the liquid.
Heat the oil to 340F (170C) on medium high heat. Drop a piece of renkon to see if it’s ready. If it comes right up, then it's time to deep fry.
Deep fry until renkon gets crispy and golden color.
Once they are nicely fried, spread on a wired rack or paper towel to drip excel oil. Season with salt and aonori and serve immediately.
To Bake in the Oven
Baked Renkon Chips won't be as crispy as deep-fried version, but if you prefer this method, here are the instructions. Preheat oven 350 ºF (170 ºC). Lay each lotus root slice in a single layer on the prepared baking sheets lined with parchment paper and lightly brush the top with some oil. Bake for 15-20 minutes, depending on thickness.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Beat the egg and water in a small bowl.
Place half of the pastry circles (12 circles for me) onto a parchment paper lined baking sheet. Then put a small amount of fruits of your choice in the center. You can sprinkle a little bit of sugar if you like. I made half with sugar and half without sugar (fruits were pretty sweet already).
After you put all the fruits, brush the edges of the pastry circles with the egg wash using a pastry brush.
Put remaining pastry circles on top of the filling.
Press the edges of circles firmly to seal with a fork.
Using a kitchen knife, make 2 small slits on top of the pastry and brush the top of pastries with the egg wash using a pastry brush.

Gather all the ingredients.
Carefully wash the sweet potatoes (Don’t peel the skin). Cut the sweet potatoes diagonally while rotating the sweet potato a quarter between cuts. This Japanese cutting technique is called “Rangiri”.
Put the sweet potatoes in 8 cups water and add 2 tsp salt. Soak for 15 minutes to remove starch.
Add the oil in the medium pot (I use a 2.75-QT Staub) and bring it to 320ºF (160ºC) (Use a cooking thermometer helps!). Meanwhile, dry the sweet potatoes with the kitchen towel (or paper towel).
When the oil has reached 320ºF (160ºC), add the sweet potatoes (half of them) into the oil and deep fry. Do not crowd the pot and fry in batches (I do twice).
Deep fry until golden brown, about 10 minutes.
When it's golden brown, insert a wooden skewer to make sure it goes through. Transfer to a wire rack or a paper towel to drain the oil.
To make candy (syrup), combine 5 Tbsp sugar, 1 ½ Tbsp water, and 1 Tbsp Mirin in a large frying pan off the heat. Put on the stove and bring it to boil on medium heat.
Once the mixture is bubbling, add 1 tsp vinegar and 1 tsp soy sauce.
Reduce the mixture, stirring constantly, until the right consistency. When you can draw a line on the pan, add the sweet potatoes.
Turn off the heat and coat the sweet potatoes with syrup. Sprinkle black sesame seeds (once the candy is hardened, sesame seeds won't stick to the surface, so do it while candy is soft).
Serve on a plate or bowl. Enjoy!

To Make Dough
Using the fine mesh strainer, sift the flour into a large bowl. Combine hot water, oil, and kosher salt.
Mix the dry ingredients and wet ingredients with chopsticks until you can pick up the dough with hands.
Use the dough to pick up crumbs in the bowl.
Knead on a lightly floured surface for about 3 minutes, until a smooth dough forms. In Japan, we say “knead until the texture is like your earlobe”.
Form the dough into a ball, put it back in the bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let it rest at room temperature for at least 30 minutes or longer. Letting the dough rest increases its elasticity making it easier to work with later, so please don't skip.
To Make Eggplant Filling
While the dough rests, make the fillings. Remove the eggplant stem and cut it half vertically. Then slice into half circles. Soak in water for 5-10 minutes (Meanwhile, you can cut Kabocha). Drain well and set aside.
Heat sesame oil in a large frying pan and sauté eggplant until it is coated with oil. Cover the lid and cook on low heat for 5 minutes.
When tender, add sugar and combine well.
Add miso and julienned shiso leaves, and mix well together. Transfer to a dish to let cool.
To Make Kabocha Filling
Cut the kabocha into smaller wedges and remove the skin (See How To Cut a Kabocha Squash).
Cut each wedge into thin slices and then cut into thin strips.
Heat the oil in the frying pan and sauté the kabocha. When it’s coated with oil, add water and cook covered for 5 minutes on low heat.
Add sugar and combine well.
Add soy sauce and pinch of salt. Mix well together.
Transfer to the dish to let cool.
To Shape into Oyaki
Roll out the rested dough into a rectangular or circle shape and divide it into 12 pieces.
Make each dough into a ball then press down with your hand.
Stretch the dough to 10 cm (4 inches) in diameter. The important trick is to keep the center thicker than the edges. Using your fingers, stretch the outer edges by rotating the dough. This way, when you pinch the dough to seal, the dough won’t be too thick/too much.
Place about 1 Tbsp of the filling in the center of each piece of dough. Close the oyaki by bringing the dough up over the filling, pinching at the top to seal.
I use the same pleating technique as my Nikuman recipe (see the video on how I close the dough and pinch).
After pinching the dough, put the pinched-side down on a lightly floured surface and twist a few times. Then press the top of the oyaki a little bit into a slightly flat ball.
To Cook Oyaki
Set a steamer ready, by placing a steamer basket on top of wok/pot filled with enough boiling water. If you don’t have a steamer, after cooking the oyaki in a frying pan, add ¼ cup water to the pan. Cover with a lid and steam it until the water evaporates.
Heat the oil in a frying pan (12 inch) and cook oyaki, pinched-side down.
Pan fry for 3-4 minutes each side, or until golden brown.
Transfer the oyaki to a steamer basket and cover to cook on high heat for 15-20 minutes (depending on the size of the oyaki and filling – small one should take about 10 minutes). Make sure the lid is covered with the kitchen towel so condensation on the lid doesn’t fall onto the oyaki.
When they are done steaming, transfer to a wire rack (I use a bamboo strainer) where the heat can escape from the bottom.
To Serve and Store
Enjoy them immediately. As soon as they become warm, not hot, cover the leftovers with plastic wrap (I wrap individually). Don’t wait until completely cooled down. You can freeze to store for up to a month, and re-steam to enjoy later.",en-US,{},4.7,,Just One Cookbook,145,12 serving(s)

Place mochi in a toaster oven and toast until puffed up and golden brown, about 10 minutes. You can also pan-fry, boil it in the water, or microwave. For microwaving, put a mochi in a bowl, add water to cover it, and microwave.
Once mochi is puffed up, gently smash the mochi with your hand.
To Make Kinako Mochi
Mix together 2 Tbsp kinako and 1 Tbsp sugar in a bowl. Prepare a small bowl of 1 cup hot water.
Dip the cooked mochi in the hot water, then dredge in the kinako + sugar mixture.
To Make Isobeyaki
Mix together 2 Tbsp soy sauce and 1 Tbsp of sugar in a bowl and microwave for 20 seconds.

To Prepare Fruits
Remove the core of strawberries.
Cut off both ends and peel the skin of the kiwis.
Cut off both ends of the navel orange. Remove the peel. Carefully peel off the segment wall and get each segment out.
Using a paper towel, remove the moisture of the fruits.
To Make Whipped Cream
Prepare a large bowl of iced water and place a medium bowl inside the larger bowl to keep cool. Make sure the bowl is clean and dry. Add the heavy whipping cream and start whisking on low speed.
Once bubbly, add sugar and rum (if you are using) and start whisking on medium-high speed.
The cream will be thicker as you whip.
When you lift the whisk out of the cream and shows peaks, remove the bowl from the ice bath and switch to a hand whisk. Whisk until you achieve the right consistency. Check the consistency of the whipped cream as you whisk. It should be spreadable but not runny because it goes between the sandwich bread.
Now spread the whipped cream on both sides of the sandwich bread. If there is any leftover whipped cream, you can dip your fruits or make Fruit Parfait. I prefer to keep the crust on the bread until the end. When you put fruits between two slices of the bread, the crust helps to keep it in shape.
Only on one side of the sandwich bread, align the fruits. I plan to cut the sandwich diagonally. Think carefully about how you want to show your cross section. I recommend taking a picture of the alignment of the fruits and don’t change the orientation of the sandwich.
Put the whipped cream to fill in any gap between fruits.
Put the second slices of sandwich bread over the fruits, facing the whipped cream side down.
Prepare plastic wrap, large enough to wrap the sandwich tightly from all four sides. Remember, don’t change the orientation of the sandwich.
Mark the cross section over the plastic wrap with a pen.
Put the sandwiches between plates and refrigerate for at least one hour (up to overnight). In Japan, putting weight on the sandwich is a pretty standard method prior to cutting in half.
Open the plastic wrap and cut the sandwich in half diagonally with a clean knife. Keep it closed (Don’t open the sandwich to show cross section yet). Clean the knife with a hot wet towel before each cut.
Gently press down the sandwich and cut off the 4 edges.
Now the cross section is revealed for the first time!
Serve immediately. If you plan to transfer the sandwich, make sure to keep it chilled all times.

To Dry Mochi (7-10 Days Before Frying)
Cut kirimochi into small pieces and ⅛ inch (3 mm) thickness. Lay the mochi pieces in a single layer on a flat tray or wire rack.
Allow them to air dry with good ventilation for at least one week. As mochi pieces dehydrate, they might break into smaller pieces so try not to touch. The surface of mochi pieces will be cracked and flaky and the texture will be harder.
Another option: I haven't tried this method, but I've read that you can alternatively bake the mochi pieces at 400ºF (200ºF) for 15 mins. For a convection oven, reduce cooking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC). You can lightly brush oil and season with salt (so the salt will stick to the rice crackers).
To Cook Rice Crackers
In a frying pan (I use a cast-iron skillet), add the oil to about ¾ inch (2 cm) deep and heat it to 340ºF (170ºC). Add a few pieces of mochi pieces first. If small bubbles start to appear around the mochi, then add more pieces in a single layer, keeping some space in between as they pop and expand. The mochi pieces will turn white and puff up.
Turn over each piece and cook until mochi pieces are popped and lightly golden brown. Increase heat so the oil is 350ºF (180ºC) and fry till mochi pieces are golden brown.
Remove the mochi pieces from the oil and place a wire rack or a plate lined with paper towels. While they are hot, season with salt.
Optionally, you can sprinkle furikake or brush soy sauce (adjust the amount of salt if you use soy sauce).

To Prepare Fillings
Grind ¼ cup katsuobushi (bonito flakes) into a fine powder. Set aside, we'll use this powder when we're cooking Takoyaki.
Cut green onions into fine slices and mince 1 Tbsp red pickled ginger.
Cut the octopus into ½ inch (1.3 cm) bite-size pieces (cut into smaller pieces for kids so they can chew easily). I use ""rangiri"" cutting technique.
To Make Takoyaki Batter
In a large mixing bowl, combine 1 cup (120 g) all-purpose flour, 2 tsp baking powder, and ½ tsp kosher salt and whisk all together.
Add 2 large eggs, 1 tsp soy sauce, and 1 ½ cup (360 ml) dashi.
Whisk all together until well-blended and transfer the batter to a 2-cup measuring cup with a handle (or any other pitcher with a spout for easy pouring).
To Cook Takoyaki
Heat the takoyaki pan to 400ºF (200ºC) over medium heat. Using a brush, generously oil the takoyaki pan (both the holes and connecting flat areas). When you see smoke coming from the pan, pour the batter to fill the holes. It’s okay for the batter to slightly overflow the holes. Usually, as you add ingredients to the batter it will overflow.
Add 1-3 octopus pieces in each hole depending on its size and sprinkle katsuobushi powder you ground earlier on top.
Then sprinkle tenkasu, green onion, and pickled red ginger.
After 3 minutes or so, when the bottom of the balls has hardened slightly, break the connected batter between each ball with skewers. Then turn each piece 90 degrees, stuffing in the edges as you are turning. The batter will flow out from the inside of each takoyaki ball and creates the other side of the takoyaki ball. After you finish flipping, set the timer for 4 minutes. Keep turning constantly so each piece will have a nice round shape. Home takoyaki grill doesn’t equally distribute heat so it’s a good idea to swap takoyaki balls around to get even brown color.
To Serve
Transfer takoyaki balls onto a plate and pour takoyaki sauce, mayonnaise. Finish off with sprinkling katsuobushi and dried green seaweed. Serve immediately (but be careful – inside is VERY hot!).

Put 10.6 oz flour, scant 2 Tbsp sugar, ½ tsp salt, 1 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp instant dry yeast, and 1 Tbsp oil in a large bowl. While mixing the mixture with chopsticks or a wooden spoon, slowly pour 160-170 ml water into the mixture and mix until incorporated.
Lightly dust your hand with flour to keep the dough from sticking too much. Use your hand to knead the dough, pressing it down and reshaping it. Form it into a ball.
Sprinkle the working surface with flour. Transfer the dough onto the surface and start kneading. This is how I knead. First, press the top half of the dough, pushing forward slightly. Then pull it back and fold it in half and press it forward again with the heel of your hand twice. Then turn the dough slightly and repeat this process for 10-15 minutes or until the dough becomes smooth and silky. Sprinkle the dough with a little bit of flour at a time to help decrease the stickiness.
Form the dough into a smooth, round shape, gently tucking loose ends underneath. Coat the bottom of the bowl with oil and place the dough in the bowl. Cover it with plastic wrap and put it in a warm place until the dough doubles in size, about 30-60 minutes.
While you’re waiting for the dough to rise, make the filling. First, soak the dried shiitake mushrooms in ½ cup water. Place something heavy on top so the whole shiitake will be submerged. Set aside for 10-15 minutes.
Thinly slice the scallion. Remove the tough core of the cabbage and chop into 1” (2.5 cm) pieces.
Sprinkle the chopped cabbage with 1 tsp salt to draw out excess water.
Once shiitake mushrooms are hydrated, squeeze the liquid out, cut off the tough stem, and mince the mushroom tops.
In a large bowl, combine ground pork, scallion, and shiitake mushrooms. Squeeze the excess water out from the cabbage with your hands and add it into the bowl.
Grate ginger and add all the seasonings (1 tsp sugar, 1 Tbsp sake, 1 Tbsp soy sauce, 1 Tbsp sesame oil, 1 Tbsp potato/corn starch, and freshly ground black pepper).
Knead the mixture well until it is well combined and looks pale and sticky. Set aside (or cover with plastic wrap and keep in the fridge) until the dough is ready.
Once the dough has doubled in size, dust the working surface with flour and divide the dough in half and then roll each piece of dough into a log. Cut each log into 5 even pieces and then cut each piece in half. You can divide into fewer pieces of dough to make bigger buns. It's also easier to work with smaller dough to make nice pleats when you wrap because it's hard to hold a big dough and filling in one hand. Form each piece of dough into a ball and dust the dough balls with flour to avoid sticking to each other. Space each ball apart and cover loosely with a damp kitchen cloth to avoid drying out. Let them rest for 10 minutes.
Take a ball of dough and flatten it with your palm. Then roll it with a rolling pin into a round sheet. Here’s how I roll the dough. Hold the top of the dough with the left hand and use a rolling pin to roll out the dough with the right hand. You only need to roll up and down on the bottom half of the dough. After rolling 1-2 times, rotate the dough about 30 degrees with the left hand. Repeat this process until the dough becomes thin. The center of dough should be thicker than the edge.
Scoop 1 ½ Tbsp of filling (I use this 1 ½ Tbsp cookie scoop) and place in the center of the dough.
Hold the dough with the left hand and seal the bun using the right index finger and thumb. First, pick up a corner of the dough with your right index finger and thumb and pinch together (left picture). Without moving your thumb, use your right index finger to pick up the dough and pinch it with your thumb while rotating the dough clockwise with your left hand (right picture).
Repeat this process about 10-12 times (= 10-12 pleats) until you seal the last part of the dough by pinching it tightly. Here are some tips: your left thumb should hold down the filling and use your left fingers to turn around the wrapper. Use your left index finger to help to pleat. Also, lift up the pinched pleats slightly while you make the new pleat so the filling stays inside the dough.
Once you finish sealing the last part of the dough, twist the pleats further with your right index finger and thumb to maintain a tight seal. If you’re left-handed, reverse the directions.
Easy Alternative Option: Wrap the filling by bringing the dough up around the meat to the top, forming little pleats with the excess dough, then slightly twisting the dough to close it and pinching it firmly to join the edges.
Place the bun on a piece of parchment paper that fits the bun (for small size, 3” x 3”). Cover the finished buns with plastic wrap and repeat this process with the rest of the dough. Let the buns rest for 20 minutes.
Bring water to boil and set a steamer. Once the water is boiling, place the buns and parchment paper in the steamer tray leaving about 2” between each bun (buns will get larger while being steamed). Close the lid and steam over high heat for 10 minutes (10 for small buns, 13 for medium, 15 for big). If you use a regular pot for steaming, wrap the lid with a kitchen cloth to prevent the condensation (formed on the lid) from dripping onto the buns. Enjoy immediately.

In a large bowl, combine 1 large egg and ⅓ cup black sugar, and whisk together until sugar has dissolved.
Add 1 tsp oil and whisk together.
Sift 1 cup cake flour, 1 tsp baking powder, and ⅛ tsp kosher salt over the egg and sugar mixture.
Using a silicone spatula, start to combine the dry and wet ingredients. If the dough is too wet, you can add extra flour. Moisture in the air effects, so you have to decide how your dough is like. If you feel that it’s too soft and wet, add more flour 1 Tbsp at a time. The consistency is similar to cookie dough, but slightly softer. Let the dough rest for an hour.
Bring the oil in the deep fryer to 300-320ºF (150-160ºC) over medium-low heat. In order to cook inside the dough, we deep fry at low temperature. For a medium saucepan, you will need about 3 cups of oil. You can use less oil, but you will need to rotate the balls often as they won’t be covered by oil.
Prepare some oil (for rolling the dough) in a small bowl and rub it on your palms which will prevent the dough from sticking to your hands.
When the oil in the deep fryer reaches 300-320ºF (150-160ºC), scoop the dough with a cookie scooper and roll into a ball. To achieve the same portion size for whatever you're making, a cookie scooper is a great tool to have. The size should be slightly bigger than 1 inch (should be around 3 cm). We say the size should be Ping-Pong ball size (if that helps).
As soon as you are done with rolling, start putting the dough balls into the oil. They will expand so do not put too many.
Once the dough balls are cooked through, they start to float. They rotate themselves, but you can help them rotate to achieve even coloring.
When golden brown, about 7-8 minutes of deep frying, pick them up and drain excess oil on a paper towel or wire rack. Let cool for 5 minutes and enjoy!

Cover the pot with the lid and gently shake the pot from side to side (or back and forth). This will distribute the popcorns in an even layer and mix the truffle and salt with the kernels.
While the kernels pop, shake the pot occasionally over the burner to prevent the kernels from burning. When you are not shaking the pot, keep the lid slightly ajar to release the steam from the popcorn. Cook until there are about 2-3 seconds between pops. By this time, you can’t hear many kernels moving against the bottom of the pan.
Remove from the heat. Shake a few times to let the last few kernels pop and take the lid off to let the steam out, this will allow the popcorns to stay crisp. Enjoy!

Homemade Rice Crackers (Kakimochi),Namiko Chen,https://www.justonecookbook.com/rice-cracker-recipe/,Japanese,https://www.justonecookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Kakimochi.jpg,"['4 kirimochi or homemade mochi ((rectangular rice cake))', 'neutral-flavored oil (vegetable, canola, etc)', 'kosher/sea salt (I use Diamond Crystal; Use half for table salt) ((I used Himalayan Pink Salt))', 'furikake (rice seasoning)', 'soy sauce']","Gather all the ingredients.
To Dry Mochi (7-10 Days Before Frying)
Cut kirimochi into small pieces and ⅛ inch (3 mm) thickness. Lay the mochi pieces in a single layer on a flat tray or wire rack.
Allow them to air dry with good ventilation for at least one week. As mochi pieces dehydrate, they might break into smaller pieces so try not to touch. The surface of mochi pieces will be cracked and flaky and the texture will be harder.
Another option: I haven't tried this method, but I've read that you can alternatively bake the mochi pieces at 400ºF (200ºF) for 15 mins. For a convection oven, reduce cooking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC). You can lightly brush oil and season with salt (so the salt will stick to the rice crackers).
To Cook Rice Crackers
In a frying pan (I use a cast-iron skillet), add the oil to about ¾ inch (2 cm) deep and heat it to 340ºF (170ºC). Add a few pieces of mochi pieces first. If small bubbles start to appear around the mochi, then add more pieces in a single layer, keeping some space in between as they pop and expand. The mochi pieces will turn white and puff up.
Turn over each piece and cook until mochi pieces are popped and lightly golden brown. Increase heat so the oil is 350ºF (180ºC) and fry till mochi pieces are golden brown.
Remove the mochi pieces from the oil and place a wire rack or a plate lined with paper towels. While they are hot, season with salt.
Optionally, you can sprinkle furikake or brush soy sauce (adjust the amount of salt if you use soy sauce).
To Serve and Store
It's best to consume immediately on the same day. Once cooled, you can also put them in an airtight container and store at room temperature for a few days.",en-US,{},4.19,,Just One Cookbook,10100,2 serving(s)
