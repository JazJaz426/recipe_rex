Make Kombu Dashi
Put the kombu in 4 cups of water and let steep for 20 minutes, or as long as you can (maximum overnight).
Transfer the kombu and water to a pot. Bring it to near boiling point on medium heat. If you didn’t steep for a long time at Step 1, it’s good to slowly bring the kombu water to near boiling on low heat. Once the bubbles start to appear and it looks like almost boiling, remove the kombu and turn off the heat. If you leave the kombu in water, kombu dashi can become bitter. So it’s usually recommended to take out. Use this used kombu to make a simmered kombu or homemade furikake (rice seasoning).
Prepare Other Add-ins and Garnish
Rehydrate dried wakame seaweed in water for 5 minutes. Squeeze water out and place it in miso soup bowls.
Cut the green onions into small pieces (diagonally – optional) and set aside in a small bowl.
Set the miso soup bowls and green onion aside for now.
Add Miso
A typical Japanese miso soup bowl holds about 200 ml of liquid. Miso varies in saltiness depends on types and brands; but as a general rule, we add 1 tablespoon (20 g) of miso per one miso soup bowl (200 ml dashi). I use miso muddler (one side measures 1 Tbsp, the other side 2 Tbsp). For this recipe, I use roughly 4-5 Tbsp. Tip: When you add tofu, you may want to add an extra tablespoon (that’s why I add 5 Tbsp total) because tofu contains additional moisture which dilutes miso soup.
When you add miso, turn off the heat (we should NEVER let miso soup boil). Scoop some dashi/soup into your ladle and let the miso dissolve in the ladle first using chopsticks or a whisk. Tip: Do not directly drop miso into the soup because you may end up with undissolved chunks of miso left in the soup. It’s very important to taste to check the saltiness.
Add Tofu
Cut tofu into small cubes and add to the miso soup (Please use a cutting board if you are not used to cutting it on your palm).
Reheat until hot (but not boiling) and serve. Tip: After adding miso, never let miso soup boil (It will lose the aroma and flavor and also kill the probiotics in the miso.).",en-US,{},4.88,,Just One Cookbook,30,4 serving(s)

Soak kombu in water overnight in a large pot.
Peel taro (satoimo) and slice into rounds. Soak in water to remove the slimy texture.
Peel daikon and slice into rounds. If it’s a large daikon, cut into quarters lengthwise.
Peel carrot and slice into rounds. If you like to decorate the soup with a carrot flower, cut out some of the round slices into a floral shape. If you do so, separate the rounds and flower shapes pieces. You will be cooking round carrot slices with taro (satoimo) and daikon, but these flower slices will be cooked separately.
Add satoimo (taro), daikon, and carrots into the pot filled with kombu water. Start cooking over medium high heat. Right before full boiling, remove the kombu and discard.
Skim off foam (from satoimo/taro) from the surface of the soup with a fine mesh strainer. Lower the heat to medium low and cover with a lid, leaving a gap. Simmer until the vegetables are tender. Add water if too much liquid has evaporated.
Meanwhile, cut komatsuna (or spinach) in half. Start boiling water in a saucepan. If you prepare carrot flower slices, add them into the water. When water is boiling, add komatsuna and cook till tender.
Take out komatsuna and carrot when they are tender and cut komatsuna into smaller pieces. Set these toppings aside for now.
Once the vegetables in the soup are tender, add 3 Tbsp saikyo miso first. Then add 1 Tbsp at a time till you’re satisfied with the flavor. My family likes thick soup so I tend to add more. Add tofu after you mix in miso so you won't break tofu.
Peel the skin of yuzu and flip over to remove any white part. Julienne the yuzu skin.
Use a toaster oven to toast the mochi until puffy. You can also toast mochi over open flame or under a broiler.

Miso Soup,Namiko Chen,https://www.justonecookbook.com/homemade-miso-soup/,Japanese,https://www.justonecookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Homemade-miso-soup-6037-I-3.jpg,"['4 cups water', '1 piece kombu (dried kelp) ((⅓ oz, 10 g; 4"" x 4"" or 10 x 10 cm))', '1 cup katsuobushi (dried bonito flakes) ((packed; I used loose 3 cups in the video for strong dashi flavor))', '1 cup dashi (Japanese soup stock; click to learn more)', '1 Tbsp miso ((18 g))', 'Ingredients of your choice ((Please read the blog post))', 'green onion/scallion ((finely chopped))']","To Make Dashi (Can be Made in Advance):
Clean the kombu with a damp towel and soak the kombu in water for 30 minutes or overnight (preferred). NEVER wash kombu and do not remove the white substance -that’s umami! These days it's pretty clean, so you can skip this process. Just make sure there are no dirty particles.
After 30 minutes (or overnight), the kombu is rehydrated. This liquid is called cold brew Kombu Dashi.
Pour kombu dashi and kombu into a saucepan. SLOWLY bring to boil on medium-low heat so you can extract umami from kombu as much as possible. Right before the stock is boiling (it gets slimy and yields a bitter taste if you leave it), remove the kombu. Now what you have is Kombu Dashi. If you’re vegetarian/vegan, use this kombu dashi for your miso soup. What to do with used kombu? You can reuse it to make Simmered Kombu or Homemade Furikake Rice Seasoning.
If you're not vegetarian/vegan, add Katsuobushi and let it simmer for 30-60 seconds. Turn off the heat and let steep for 10 minutes.
Strain over a fine-mesh sieve and now you have roughly 4 cups of Awase Dashi. You can store in the refrigerator for up to 3-5 days and in the freezer for up to 2 weeks. Repurpose the used katsuobushi to make Homemade Furikake Rice Seasoning.
STEP 1 - Add Dashi
Here I demonstrate to make 2 cups/2 servings of miso soup. You can use the formula; 1 cup (200-240 ml) dashi + 1 Tbsp (18 g) miso = 1 serving miso soup. If you add more ingredients/vegetables, the amount of soup will increase and you will also need more miso. Add 2 cups (480 ml) dashi in the saucepan.
Are you in a hurry and no time to make dashi? You can use Dashi Packet or Dashi Powder to make instant dashi.
STEP 2 - Add dense ingredients BEFORE bringing dashi to a boil
If your miso soup doesn't include hard ingredients or clams, go to the next step. Add hard ingredients like root vegetables. Once boiling, lower the heat and simmer until they become tender. If you're making Clam Miso Soup, add clams in cold brew kombu dashi. Bring it to a gentle boil and once the shells are open, turn off the heat (do not overcook).
STEP 3- Add quick-cooking ingredients AFTER dashi is boiling
If your miso soup doesn’t include these ingredients, bring dashi to a boil and go to next step. AFTER dashi starts boiling, add in soft vegetables like leafy greens, mushrooms, deep-fried tofu pouch because they require less cooking time. At this point, keep the soup at a simmer and make sure it stays warm (not OVERBOILING).
STEP 4 - Add miso
Add a small amount of miso at a time (you can start with 2 Tbsp miso for 2 cups dashi). Put miso inside a ladle and slowly add dashi into the ladle to dissolve miso completely. You can buy a miso muddler or a fine-mesh miso strainer which helps you dissolve miso faster. If you accidentally added too much miso, dilute the miso soup with dashi (or water). NEVER OVERBOIL miso soup because it loses nutrients, flavors, and fragrance.
STEP 5 - Add tofu
Add tofu AFTER miso is completely dissolved because you might break the tofu when mixing in miso. If you add chilled tofu from the refrigerator, miso soup would get cooler. Reheat miso soup until it is just hot, but NOT BOIL.
STEP 6 - Add wakame & green onions
Add rehydrated wakame (seaweed). I recommend re-hydrating dried wakame in a separate bowl of water to get rid of saltiness, instead of re-hydrating inside miso soup. Add ingredients that do not require cooking such as chopped green onions, mitsuba, yuzu, and blanched spinach right before serving to keep the fresh fragrance and color.
To Serve:
Serve immediately. Place on the right side of the table setting (Read on Ichiju Sansai, or 1 soup 3 dishes; see the picture).
To Store:
In general, it's best to use up all the miso soup because the fragrance and taste will be lost as time passes by. Let your miso soup cool at room temperature (up to 4 hours - otherwise miso soup will be spoiled) and then refrigerate. You can keep for up to 2 days in the refrigerator. If you want to make a big batch, it's best to keep the soup BEFORE adding miso. Add the miso only for the portion you need. You can freeze miso soup for up to 2 weeks. If the miso soup contains potatoes or tofu, remove them before freezing as the textures subject to change.
To Reheat Miso Soup:
Bring miso soup in a pot over medium heat, but not to overboil. Miso loses its nutrients at high temperature.",en-US,{},4.71,,Just One Cookbook,55,4 serving(s)

To make dashi: In a measuring cup (or a large pot), add 4 cups water and kombu and let it steep. You can do this process overnight or as soon as you start preparing. This is kombu dashi. If you're using dashi powder or dashi packet, follow this tutorial, and use it at Step 12.
Cut the pork belly into 1 inch (2.5 cm) pieces.
Cut the leek in half lengthwise, and then cut the halves into 1-inch pieces widthwise. Rinse under cold water to make sure there is no dirt inside the pieces.
Cut the cabbage leaves into small pieces.
Remove the stem of shiitake mushrooms and slice thinly.
Cut the carrot in half lengthwise, and slice thinly. Cut the green onions thinly.
Transfer the kombu dashi into a pot (if you didn’t use a pot at Step 2). Slowly bring the kombu dashi to a boil over medium low heat. When the water is almost boiling, remove the kombu to avoid sliminess. If you are vegan/vegetarian, skip next two steps (Step 9 and Step 10).
Add 3 cups katsuobushi and cook for 15 seconds. Then turn off the heat and let the katsuobushi steep in the pot for 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, in a separate large pot (or donabe), heat 1 Tbsp sesame oil over medium heat. Once the pot is hot, add the pork belly and stir to cook.
Once the pork belly is 80% cooked through, add 1 Tbsp sake and stir to combine. Then add chopped leeks.
Once leeks are wilted, add the rest of the vegetables and mushrooms. Stir to coat with the oil. Then using a fine-mesh strainer, strain the dashi into the pot.
Bring the soup mixture to a boil, skimming the foam and scum on the surface while cooking. Turn off the heat and add 2 Tbsp miso first, and then gradually add in more as you taste the soup. Each miso brand and type of miso tastes differently and the sodium level varies, so you want to taste before adding more miso.
Add the tofu into the soup and turn on the heat to continue to simmer until tofu is nice and warm (tofu is edible chilled, so you don’t have to worry about “cooking” it). Just make sure not to let the miso soup boil. It should take not more than 3-4 minutes to warm the tofu, and the soup is now ready.
Before serving, scoop out a small portion of Yuzu Kosho from the jar and place it on a small plate. Grind 2 Tbsp sesame seeds and put in in a small bowl. Serve them alongside with the donabe or soup pot. After you ladle the soup into individual serving bowls, add a pinch of Yuzu Kosho, sprinkle sesame seeds, stir in and enjoy!

To Prepare the Ingredients
Soak dried shiitake mushrooms in water to rehydrate for 15 minutes. You need just enough water to cover the mushrooms and place a smaller bowl on top to keep the mushrooms submerged in water.
Squeeze the excess water out of rehydrated shiitake mushrooms. Cut off the stems if there are any and score a cross on top like this and set aside (use it later for topping). Reserve the leftover soaking liquid (shiitake dashi) for udon soup by straining it through a mesh strainer to remove any grit or impurities before using it.
In lightly salted boiling water, blanch the spinach starting from the stem side for 1 minute.
Soak the spinach in iced water to prevent overcooking. Squeeze water out and cut into 1 ½” (4 cm) pieces.
Slice the carrot. Optionally you can cut out the carrot into a flower shape with a vegetable cutter.
Cut kamaboko into thin slices and break shimeji mushrooms into small pieces.
Slice the long green onion diagonally and cut the chicken into 1” (2.5 cm) pieces.
To Make the Udon Soup
To make udon soup, combine the dashi and shiitake dashi (reserved liquid from dried shiitake mushrooms) in a small saucepan. Bring it to a boil over medium-high heat.
Once boiling, add mirin, soy sauce, and salt. When boiling again, turn off the heat and set aside.
To Make Shrimp Tempura
To make shrimp tempura, follow this instruction to clean the shrimp and make them straight.
To make the tempura batter, combine the tempura batter mix and water. Lightly dust the shrimp with potato starch/cornstarch before dredging the shrimp in the batter. Deep fry at 340-350 ºF (170-180 ºC) until golden brown. If you want to make the tempura batter from scratch and learn tips on how to deep fry the shrimp, you can read the recipe here.
To Prepare Udon Noodles
Bring a large pot of water to boil for udon noodles. My favorite udon is the frozen Sanuki Udon. Cook the frozen udon noodles in boiling water for 30 seconds (no need to defrost). If you use dry noodles, follow the package instructions. Drain the water and chill in ice water to prevent the noodles from cooking further.
To Assemble
Divide all the ingredients (except for the egg, spinach, and mitsuba) into two individual earthen donabe clay pots (or use any big pot).
Add udon soup and cover with the lid. Bring the soup to a boil over medium-high heat. When it comes to a boil, leave the lid slightly open to let some steam out, or it will overflow. Lower the heat and simmer to cook until the chicken is cooked through.
Add an egg, spinach, and mitsuba and cover to cook until the egg is done to your liking.
Add shrimp tempura on top and serve. Sprinkle shichimi togarashi (Japanese seven spice) if you like the soup spicy.",en-US,{},4.84,,Just One Cookbook,60,2 serving(s)

Make Dashi:
This is an extra step and not everyone follows this method, but I highly recommend removing the head and guts from the anchovies to reduce the bitter flavor in dashi (watch how I do it in this video).
Gently clean the kombu with a damp cloth (but don't wipe off the white powder - that's umami!). In a small saucepan, put 4 cups water, kombu, and anchovies.
Bring it to boil on low heat. It’s best to slowly infuse water with kombu and anchovies. Once boiling, cover and keep on low heat and simmer for 10 minutes.
Once you are done simmering dashi, strain through a fine sieve. With leftovers, you can make candied anchovies and simmered kombu, and set aside the dashi.
Prepare Ingredients:
Meanwhile, start prepping ingredients. Thinly slice the onion. Cut tofu into small blocks.
Cut napa cabbage into 2” (5 cm) pieces widthwise (cut from bottom to leafy side). The bottom part of napa cabbage is thicker so cut these pieces into smaller pieces lengthwise (See how I do it in the video).
Slice the Tokyo Negi (or green onions/scallions) diagonally into ½“ (1.3 cm) pieces and slice the carrot diagonally into ¼” (0.6 mm).
Cut garlic chives into 2” (5 cm) pieces. Discard the bottom of enoki mushrooms and loosen them up.
Rinse bean sprouts and place all the vegetable ingredients on a plate. Cut the sliced pork belly into 2” (5 cm) pieces and set aside.

Add 1 Tbsp soy sauce and 1 Tbsp miso. Mix all together and make sure the miso is completely dissolved.
Add the rest of ingredients and cover to cook on medium heat for 10 minutes, or until all the ingredients are tender.
Taste the soup and add kosher salt if necessary (I added about ½ tsp). Each miso has different saltiness so you really need to taste the soup to adjust the flavor.

Gather all the ingredients for Chanko Nabe Broth.
To make the broth, in a Dutch oven or other large pot over medium heat, combine the broth, sake, mirin, ginger juice, and garlic and bring to a simmer.
Spoon several spoonfuls of broth into a small bowl, add the miso, and stir until smooth.
Gradually add the miso mixture to the broth in the pot, stirring to avoid lumps. Once the miso has been incorporated, do not let the broth boil.
To make the chicken meatballs:
Gather all the ingredients. This grater (I have 6"" one) works great for grating ginger (daikon, garlic, etc) and keeping the juice from grating it. In this recipe, we only use ginger juice.
In a large bowl, combine the chicken, ½ beaten egg (reserve the remaining egg for another use), the ginger juice, soy sauce, corn starch, panko, and green onion. Using your hands, mix all together.
Once the mixture becomes a little bit white and well combined, shape the mixture into a ball. Sprinkle with panko as needed.
To cut all the ingredients:
Cut the cod fillet into 2-inch chunks, peel and devein shrimp, cut the sliced pork belly into 2-inch pieces, trim the visible fat from the chicken thighs and cut into bite-sized pieces, cut the tofu into 1-inch cubes, and separate the leaves from napa cabbage and cut them into smaller pieces. Slice the carrot and cut out with a flower-shaped vegetable cutter.
Cut negi (long green onion) diagonally into 1-inch-thick pieces, cut the green onions into 2-inch lengths, and remove stems of shiitake mushrooms and make a decorative cut on the caps if desired.
To set up the table:
To prepare the stew ingredients, place the meatballs, seafood, pork belly, chicken, tofu, carrot slices, napa cabbage, long green onion, green onions, and mushrooms on the platter.
Pour the ponzu sauce and sesame sauce (goma dare) into individual dipping bowls at each place setting along with chopsticks, a soup spoon (optional) and a soup bowl.
Place a portable gas burner and the nabe, and the stew ingredients on the table. If you don’t have a gas/electric burner, you can cook the stew on the stovetop, transfer it to a large bowl, and serve it family style.
To cook Chanko Nabe:
If cooking the stew ingredients on the stovetop, cook in batches. Add some of each of the ingredients to the broth, simmer (do not boil) until cooked, and serve them, returning to the stove to start a new batch as each previous batch is eaten. The vegetables and tofu cook more quickly than the meatballs, seafood, and chicken.
Keep the broth at a simmer the entire time. If the liquid gets low, add a little water or chicken broth to have enough liquid to heat the noodles or rice at the end (even though you are thinning the broth, the flavorful ingredients you are cooking in it continue to enrich it).
When diners are ready, remove any solids in the broth and add the noodles or rice. Simmer until heated through, then ladle into the soup bowls and serve.",en-US,{},4.47,,Just One Cookbook,60,6 serving(s)

Make kombu dashi by soaking the kombu into 4 cups water. I used Kombu Dashi this time but I have made this hot pot with Awase Dashi (Kombu + Katsuobushi (dried bonito flakes)) and they both taste wonderful.
Cut the monkfish into larger bite-size pieces, about 1.5-2 inch pieces.
Cut the steamed monkfish liver into ½ inch rounds. If you have raw liver, you will need to steam it for 10 to 20 minutes first.
Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Once boiling, add the monkfish to blanch for 15 seconds.
Remove the fish from the pot and immediately transfer into a bowl of iced water. This will remove the fishy smell and help firm up the flesh of the fish. Once chilled, remove from the iced water and set aside.
Cut the negi diagonally (If you use leek, rinse well to get rid of the dirt between them).
Cut napa cabbage into bite-size pieces.
Cut shungiku into 2-inch pieces and tofu into cubes.
Discard the bottom part of enoki mushrooms and rinse quickly.
Discard the stem of shiitake mushrooms and add the decorative cut if you like (See How to Make Decorative Shiitake). Cut out carrot flower (See How to Make Flower Carrot).
Set a donabe (Japanese earthenware hot pot) over a portable stove at the table. You can also cook in a large pot on your stove top.
Add the monkfish liver in the donabe and cook on low heat. As soon as the liver starts releasing oil, use a wooden spatula/ spoon to smash it into a paste or ground-meat-like texture. It may burn a little bit, but that’s okay as long as it’s very mildly charred. It adds more flavors.
Once the liver gets pasty, add 5 Tbsp miso and combine well. Each miso brand/type has different saltiness and you just have to taste and decide if you need to add more (you will need at least 5 Tbsp).
Gradually add kombu dashi while mixing the miso mixture.
Add 4 Tbsp mirin, 2 Tbsp sake, and 4 Tbsp soy sauce, and mix well.
Add negi (leek/green onion), bottom part of napa cabbage, shungiku, shirataki, enoki mushrooms, and monkfish.
Let cook a little longer before you add in tofu and shiitake mushrooms.
Once boiling, add leafy parts of napa cabbage and shungiku. Cover, and continue to cook for another 7-10 minutes. Skim fat and scum using a fine mesh sieve.

Slice the ginger and thinly cut green onion/scallion. Keep the ginger on the side and put the green onion in a small serving bowl.
Cut the napa cabbage into quarters lengthwise. Without cutting the edge, wash the leaves carefully and drain well. Don’t throw away the leaves that naturally came off while rinsing. We’ll use these leaves later on.
Place each slice of pork belly between the napa cabbage leaves. If you have extra pork belly, you can put an additional slice in outer layers which have wide leaves. If the pork belly is too long for the napa cabbage, you can trim with a kitchen shear and place it in other parts of the napa cabbage.
Once the pork belly slices are nicely tucked in, cut the napa cabbage into 3-4 pieces, about 2 to 2 ½ inches (5-6 cm).
Start packing the layers of napa cabbage/pork belly from the outer edges of donabe (or hot pot or regular pot) and work your way towards the center. The napa cabbage/pork belly layers should be packed tightly as they become loose once it starts cooking.
If you don’t have enough layers, you might want to consider a smaller pot (remember the size of your napa cabbage and proportional pot size you used for next time) or place other ingredients in the center. Here I stuffed the center with napa cabbage leaves that came off while rinsing and cutting the napa cabbage. You can also put enoki mushrooms or shimeji mushrooms in the center.
Combine the soup ingredients (5 cups dashi, 2 Tbsp sake, 1 Tbsp soy sauce, slices of 1-inch ginger, and ½ tsp kosher salt). Don’t cut down on the salt as napa cabbage releases liquid when it's being cooked and will dilute the soup a little bit.
Pour the soup into the pot and start cooking on high heat. Once boiling, skim the foam and fat on the surface. Then reduce the heat to medium-low heat and cook until napa cabbage is tender and pork belly is cooked through, roughly 8-10 minutes.

Soaking the Oxtails
To completely remove blood from the bone, soak the oxtails in cold water for 1 hour and discard the water.
Prepare Vegetables
Meanwhile, cut the onions into wedges, chop celery stalks into small pieces, and cut the carrots into chunks.
Roughly cut the cabbage into 1 inch (2.5 cm) squares and rinse under running water.
Cut the tomatoes into wedges and cut them in halves. Cut Yukon gold potatoes into quarters and soak in water for 15 minutes to remove excess starch.
Cut the stew beef into smaller pieces.
Boiling the Oxtails
After soaking the oxtails in one hour, drain and place them in a large pot and cover it with cold water. Bring it to boil over medium-high heat. Once boiling, turn down the heat and simmer for 15 minutes. Using a fine-mesh sieve, skimming foam on the surface frequently. After simmering, take out the oxtail or drain the water. Blanching oxtails before cooking helps remove blood and impurities.
Sautéing the Ingredients
Press the “Saute” button on your Instant Pot (I use this 6 QT Instant Pot) and heat 1 ½ Tbsp olive oil.
Once the pot is hot, add the stew beef and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Sear the beef till brown on all sides. Don’t flip the pieces around until they release themselves. Transfer the meats to a plate from the pot.
Add the onion and celery and sauté until they are coated with oil and become tender. While sautéing, scrape the flavorful charred bits from the bottom of the pot. Add the tomatoes, carrots, and cabbage and coat them with oil.
When the vegetables are a bit wilted and soft, add the boiled oxtail, browned stew beef, and beef broth

To make wonton soup, cut 1 green onion into 2 inch (5 cm) pieces. Add the chicken stock and the green onion in a large pot and bring to boil.
Once boiling, season with sesame oil, kosher salt, and white pepper powder. Turn off the heat and set aside.
To make fillings, chop 2 green onions into small rounds. Save some chopped green onion to serve with the soup.
Chop cilantro and set aside to serve with the soup.
Cut the shrimp into smaller pieces, and then cut them into even smaller pieces (almost like paste).
In a large bowl, combine the pork, shrimp, and chopped green onion. Grate fresh ginger and add to the mixture.
Add all the wonton seasoning ingredients to the mixture and mix well.
While you wrap wontons, bring a large pot of water to boil. Place a wonton wrapper on your hand. Place a teaspoon of the filling in the center of the wrapper. Start with a small amount so it’s easier to work with. Use your finger to moisten the edges of the wrapper with water.
When the edges have been moistened, fold the wrapper in half to create a rectangular shape, pressing any air that might be trapped around the filling. Fold the sides inward so that they overlap.
Wet the portion where the sides meet. Pinch to close and seal.
Here is the cute little wonton! Place the finished wontons on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Cover with plastic to keep them moist as you continue with the remaining fillings and wrappers.
To Serve
To cook wontons, put 5 to 10 wontons into a boiling water in a large pot. Depending on how big your pot is, you can add more/less wontons. Do not overcrowd the pot. Cook for 5 minutes, or until wontons float on the surface of the water and are tender and translucent. I boil wontons separately from the soup so it stays clear and clean.
Transfer wontons to serving bowls. Continue with the rest of the wontons. When you are done with cooking, pour some hot soup over wontons and garnish with chopped green onions and cilantro. Sprinkle some white pepper. You can also serve with soy sauce, chili sauce, etc.
To Store
To freeze the wontons, flash freeze for 1 hour (place them on a parchment-lined baking sheet covered with plastic wrap) and transfer them to a freezer bag. Keep in the freezer for up to 1-2 months. When you're ready to cook, do not defrost and cook frozen dumplings in boiling water for 12 minutes.

Make Dashi
Make 3 cups dashi using one of 3 Ways to Make Dashi. Here I used the convenient dashi packet method. If you’re vegetarian/vegan, use Kombu Dashi. If you want to make standard Awase Dashi.
Prepare Ingredients
Cut the end of shimeji mushrooms and separate into smaller chunks.
Cut the stem of shiitake mushrooms and cut in halves. I use “sogigiri"" cutting technique to increase the surface.
If you like, you can make a decorative cut on the shiitake mushrooms.
Cut Kamaboko fish cake into 4 slices.
Cut the Negi (long green onion) diagonally, and separate white and green parts (we will add them to the pot at different times).
Pour hot water over aburaage to get rid of the factory oil. Some people skip the step as the oil used is cleaner these days. I do it anyway to get rid of excess oil. [Optional] Cut into smaller pieces. I cut into triangles.
Cut the chicken into smaller bite-size pieces. I use ""sogigiri"" technique to create a bigger surface of the chicken so it will cook faster and absorb more flavors.
Bring a pot of water to a boil. Add the frozen udon noodles and loosen it with chopsticks. As soon as they are loosened (30 seconds or so), drain the udon noodles into a colander and set aside. If you use dry noodles, follow the package instructions.
Crack eggs into a small bowl (so you won’t accidentally drop an egg shell into the pot) and make sure all ingredients are now ready to go!
Cook Miso Nikomi Udon
In a large pot (or donabe), add 3 cups dashi, chicken, and white part of negi.
Cover to cook on medium heat for 10 minutes, or until the outside of the chicken is no longer pink (inside can be still pink at this stage). When boiling, turn the heat down to simmer. Skim off the fat and scum with a fine mesh skimmer.
Add 3 Tbsp mirin and 3 Tbsp miso (keep 1 Tbsp for later. Why? Read my post.). I use a Miso Muddler and it works wonderfully to make sure miso is dissolved completely. You should place miso in a ladle and use chopsticks to let miso dissolve inside the ladle before releasing it into the dashi. That way you can make sure there are no miso chunks left at the bottom of the pot.
Add udon noodles, aburaage, shimeji mushrooms, shiitake mushrooms, and green part of negi. If you care about the presentation of this dish, now is a good time to place each ingredient and fish out the chicken pieces and place on top of udon noodles.
Increase the heat to medium, cover with the lid, and cook for 5 minutes. When boiling, turn the heat down to simmer. Once in a while, make sure to check udon or other ingredients are not stuck on the bottom of the pot, by inserting cooking chopsticks. Skim off the fat and scum with a fine mesh skimmer.
Add 1 Tbsp miso in the soup. Be careful not to drop the chunk of miso. Use a ladle as a “mixing bowl” so you won’t lose the miso.
Add kamaboko fish cakes (where it could have a nice color) and carefully drop the eggs in the middle. From this point, you do not want to cover with the lid (egg yolk will have a thin white coating when you cover). Cook for 2-3 minutes.

Prepare Stew Ingredients
Peel and cut each potato into bigger chunks (if you want to keep their shape when serving).
Peel the carrot and cut into smaller chunks. I use ""rangiri"" Japanese cutting technique.
Cut the onion in half lengthwise, and then cut each half into 6 wedges. Finally, cut them in half widthwise.
Slice the mushrooms and cut the head of broccoli into florets.
Cut the chicken thighs into smaller pieces. I use ""sogigiri"" Japanese cutting technique to create more surface space so the chicken pieces cook faster. Season the chicken with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
To Cook Ingredients in Instant Pot
Press the “Sauté” button on your Instant Pot and heat 1 Tbsp olive oil and 1 Tbsp unsalted butter.
When the pot is hot and butter is melted, add the chicken.
Stir and coat the chicken with oil.
Add the onion, carrot, mushrooms, and potatoes.
Add the chicken broth and 1 bay leaf.
Close the lid and set HIGH pressure for 2 minutes.
Make sure the steam release handle points at “sealing” and not “venting”. The float valve goes up when pressurized.
To Cook Ingredients in the Pot over the Stove
Heat the olive oil and butter in the pot over medium heat. Add the chicken and saute for 2 minutes. Then add onion and carrot and cook until coated with oil. Add the mushrooms, potatoes, broth (3.5 cups/800 ml), and bay leaf. Bring it to boil, then reduce heat to simmer (low) to cook for 20 minutes, or until carrots and potatoes are tender.
To Blanch Broccoli
While pressure cooking, blanch broccoli. Bring water to boil in a small saucepan. Once boiling, add a pinch of salt and broccoli florets.
Cook until tender but do not overcook. Transfer the broccoli to ice water to stop cooking further. Once cool, remove, drain, and set aside.
To Make White Sauce (Bechamel Sauce)
In a saucepan, melt the butter on medium heat but don’t let it brown. Microwave 1 cup of milk until it is warm to the touch and set aside.
Once the butter is melted completely, add the flour.
Stir quickly and constantly with a whisk to combine. Cook the flour mixture for 3-4 minutes, without letting it brown.
Pour a small amount of the warm milk at a time, and stir as the sauce thickens.
Gradually add the rest of the milk by whisking continually until smooth. Cook, stirring constantly, until starting to bubble and thicken.
Lower the heat and add white pepper and salt to taste.
Cook, stirring constantly, for 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside.
Once Pressure Cooking Is Done...
When it’s finished cooking, the Instant Pot will switch automatically to the “Keep Warm” mode. Let the pressure release naturally for 15 minutes and then proceed with the quick release by turning the steam release handle to the “venting” position to let steam out until the float valve drops down. Tip: Hold a kitchen towel and do not place your hand or face over the steam release valve. There should only be a little bit of steam left after 15 minutes of natural release.
Open the lid and insert a skewer in the center of the potato to see if it’s cooked through.
Using a ladle, take out 1 cup of soup from the stew.
Put the white sauce back on the stove and heat on low heat. Add several tablespoons of the soup and whisk well to combine.
Gradually add the rest of soup, stirring constantly, to combine.
Put the white sauce back in the instant pot and gently mix the white sauce with the rest of stew.
Press the “Sauté” button on your Instant Pot and press “Adjust” to set “Less” heat.
The stew will thicken as it's heated. Season with freshly ground black pepper and discard the bay leaf if you can find it.
Add the blanched broccoli and heat up. Serve the steamed rice on one side of the bowl and pour the Cream Stew on the other side of the bowl.

To De-Grit and Clean Clams
De-grit clams by following my detailed How To De-Grit Clam post. Even though some packages may say “ready to use”, I highly recommend doing this process. Quick Summary: Add 1 Tbsp salt in 2 cups water in a bowl and let it dissolved completely. Tip: Place a sieve in the bowl so that any sand and grit the clams purge would stay on the bottom of the bowl instead of being consumed by the clams again.
Add the clams inside the sieve without overlapping each other. The water level should be right around the clam’s mouth. If there isn’t enough salt water, make more using the same ratio (1 Tbsp salt for 2 cups water). Cover the bowl with aluminum foil to create a dark environment for clams and leave it in a cool place for 2 hours. This should give clams enough time to purge sand and grit.
Wash the clams carefully with a brush. Clams are now ready to use.
To Prepare Clam Miso Soup
In a medium pot, put the clean clams, 2 cups water, and kombu and bring it to a boil over medium heat.
When boiling, reduce the heat to medium-low.
Skim off the scum using a fine-mesh skimmer. Tip: Prepare a cup/bowl of water and dip the skimmer in the water to clean.
When all the clams opened up, turn off the heat immediately and do not overcook it. Remove and discard the kombu.
Use a ladle and dissolve 1 Tbsp miso at a time before adding another tablespoon. Each brand of miso has different saltiness so adjust accordingly.

To Make Sukiyaki Sauce
Combine 1 cup sake, 1 cup mirin, ¼ cup sugar, and 1 cup soy sauce in a small saucepan and bring it to a boil. Once boiling, turn off the heat and set aside. This Sukiyaki sauce can be stored in an air-tight container in the refrigerator for up to a month.
To Prepare the Ingredients
If your udon is frozen, cook it in boiling water until loosen. Remove from heat and soak in iced water to prevent overcooking them. Drain and transfer to a plate covered with plastic. You will not need it till the end of the sukiyaki meal.
Prepare sukiyaki ingredients. Cut napa cabbage into 2” (5 cm) wide then cut in half right at the middle of the white part.
Cut shungiku into 2” (5 cm) wide, and slice Tokyo negi. Discard the bottom part of enoki and tear into smaller bundles.
Discard the shiitake stem and decorate the top of shiitake if you like.
Cut tofu into smaller pieces (I usually cut into 6-8 pieces).
If you like, you can slice some carrots and then stamp them into a floral shape for decoration.
Drain and rinse the shirataki noodles (sorry no photo). Put all the ingredients on one big platter for the table or into smaller individual servings.
To Cook Sukiyaki
Set a portable gas cooktop at the dining table. Each person should have a medium-sized bowl where the cooked food is being transferred to from the pot. Heat a cast iron sukiyaki pot (or any pot) on medium heat. When it’s hot, add 1 Tbsp cooking oil (or beef fat).
Place 2-4 slices of well-marbled beef to sear and sprinkle 1 Tbsp brown sugar. Flip and cook the other side of the meat. You can pour a little bit of Sukiyaki Sauce over the meat and enjoy some (or all) of the sweet and nicely caramelized meat now (this is to enjoy the good quality meat), and continue to the next step.
The First Round of Sukiyaki
Pour half of the Sukiyaki Sauce you made (1 ⅓ cup) and 1 cup dashi (or water) in the pot.
Add vegetables, tofu, and other ingredients to the pot (keep the udon for later). Add more Sukiyaki Sauce or dashi (or water) if necessary. The ⅔ of the ingredients should be submerged in the broth. Put the lid on and bring to a gentle boil. Once boiling, turn down the heat and simmer until the ingredients are cooked through. Once ingredients are cooked through, you can add more beef as beef will cook fast. Enjoy the first round of sukiyaki. If the sauce gets too salty (from evaporating), add dashi (or water) to dilute. If the vegetables diluted the sauce too much, then add more sukiyaki sauce.
The Second/Third Round of Sukiyaki (Optional)
When there is less cooked food in the pot, divide the leftover into individual bowls. Then start cooking the second round by adding more ingredients to the pot (repeat the previous step). While the second round of sukiyaki is being cooked, you can enjoy the leftover from the first pot or any side dishes.
To End the Meal
We usually end the sukiyaki meal with udon. When most of the ingredients have disappeared, add udon to the pot. Cook until heated through and enjoy.

Gather all the ingredients. Please make dashi and oxtail broth ahead of time.
Fish cakes: Boil 4 cups (1000 ml) water. Meanwhile, open the oden mix packages and place the fish cakes in the sieve. Pour boiling water all over the fish cakes to remove the excess oil. Alternatively, you can place them in boiling water for 15 seconds. If you prefer, cut the big pieces into smaller pieces.
Konnyaku: Cut a slab of Konnyaku into 4 equal rectangles. Then cut each rectangle diagonally so now you have 8 triangle pieces.
Then scorch the flat surfaces of konnyaku with crisscross incision. This helps konnyaku to absorb more flavors during cooking.
In a small pot, place all the konnyaku in cold water and bring to a boil. Then cook for 1 minute and drain or using a tong to remove the pieces. Set aside.
Daikon radish: Peel the daikon and cut into ½ to ⅔ inch (1 cm) pieces. To prepare daikon for oden properly, please follow this recipe post where we remove corners of daikon to prevent from breaking and then pre-cook it. In this recipe, I cut daikon thinner than my stovetop method so it will cook faster.
Octopus: If you’re using frozen octopus, defrost and put each piece of octopus into skewers. If you’re using long octopus legs, you can skewer each piece (see this oden post).
To Make Oxtail Dashi Broth
In your slow cooker (or Instant Pot), add 2 ½ cup oxtail broth, 2 ½ cup dashi, 2 tbsp mirin, and 2 tbsp soy sauce.
Add ½ tsp kosher salt and 1 tsp sugar.
To Cook Oden
Add daikon, oxtail meat from the oxtail broth, boiled eggs, and konnyaku.
Then add octopus skewers, fish cakes, and mochi pouch (click here to make your own mochi pouch).

Serve the assortment of oden ingredients on a plate with some soup. Put a small dollop of karashi hot mustard on the edge of the plate. When you eat, dab the fish cakes or other foods with a tiny bit of mustard. You can drink the soup if you like, and I like to break the egg in half and let it absorbs the soup before eating.

1) Japanese Turnip Miso Soup
Cut off the ends and peel the turnip.
Cut the turnip in half and thinly slice the halves.
To remove the oil from aburaage, you can either pour boiling water over the tofu pouch in a sieve over the sink or have a quick blanch over the boiling water in a small pot for 15 seconds (flipping 1-2 times). Once that’s done, cut the aburaage in half widthwise, and cut thinly. Keep the other half for future use.
In a small saucepan, add 1 ½ cup water, sliced turnip, and the aburaage.
Cover with the lid, but keep it slightly ajar to avoid boiling over. Bring it to a boil over medium heat. Once boiling, lower the heat to simmer and cook the turnip for 5-6 minutes, or until it’s transparent.
If you wish to add the turnip leaves into the soup, quickly chop the green leafy part of the turnip. Add some into the soup and save the remaining greens. At this stage, make sure the soup is hot and you’re about to serve miso soup. What to do with the rest of the chopped leaves? Read Notes for a quick delicious recipe.
Make sure the soup is hot as we will not reheat and turn off the heat. Add miso into the ladle, NOT into the soup. Use a pair of chopsticks (or fork) to dissolve the miso completely in the ladle before releasing it into the soup.
ALWAYS taste the miso soup before adding more miso. Serve immediately. If you need to reheat the miso soup, make sure not to let it boil, once you see steam coming off, you can turn off the heat.
2) Bamboo Shoot & Wakame Miso Soup
Soak the dried wakame seaweed in water for 5 minutes. Drain, squeeze water out and set aside.
Cut the green onions thinly and set aside.
Cut the bamboo shoot into small bite-size thin pieces.
In a small saucepan, add 1 ½ cup water and sliced bamboo shoots.
Cover with the lid, but keep it slightly ajar to avoid boiling over. Bring it to a boil over medium heat. Once boiling, turn off the heat.
Make sure the soup is hot at this stage as we will not reheat. Add miso into the ladle, NOT into the soup. Use a pair of chopsticks (or fork) to dissolve miso completely in the ladle before releasing it into the soup. ALWAYS taste the miso soup before adding more miso.
Serve immediately. If you need to reheat the miso soup, make sure not to let it boil, once you see steam coming off, you can turn off the heat.
3) Snap Pea Miso Soup
To remove the oil from aburaage, you can either pour boiling water over the tofu pouch in a sieve over the sink or have a quick blanch over the boiling water in a small pot for 15 seconds (flipping 1-2 times). Once that’s done, cut the aburaage in half widthwise, and cut thinly. Keep the other half for future use.
Pull off the tough string that runs along the length of the pod. Then cut in half diagonally.
In a small saucepan, add 1 ½ cup water and aburaage. Place the lid, keeping it slightly ajar to avoid boiling over. Bring it to a boil over medium heat, and once boiling, lower the heat to simmer.
Add the snap peas and warm them for 2 minutes on a simmer (don’t overcook). Turn off the heat.
Make sure the soup is hot at this stage as we will not reheat. Add miso into the ladle, NOT into the soup. Use a pair of chopsticks (or fork) to dissolve the miso completely in the ladle before releasing into the soup. ALWAYS taste the miso soup before adding more miso. Serve immediately.

To Prepare the Dashi
In a large pot (I used a donabe), add dashi broth. If you are making dashi from scratch, here’s the direction (https://www.justonecookbook.com/how-to-make-dashi/). In this recipe, I show you how to make dashi using a dashi packet. Add water and a dashi packet in the donabe.
Cover the lid and slowly bring water to boil on low heat. After a few minutes, open the lid and shake the bag to release more flavors.
Close the lid and continue to heat the broth. Once boiling, cook for 3 minutes and discard the dashi packet. Keep the lid closed and set aside.
To Prepare the Ingredients
Remove the excess fat from the chicken and cut it into small bite-sized pieces.
Discard the tough stem of shiitake mushrooms and thinly slice the caps.
Cut the carrot into quarters lengthwise and thinly slice them.
Cut the green onions into thin pieces and put them in a small bowl. We use them as a garnish at the end.
If you’re using cold cooked rice, put it in a fine-mesh sieve and rinse the rice under running water to remove excess starch. Shake and drain well. If you’re using freshly made rice, you can skip this process.
To Cook Zosui
In a hot dashi broth, add the chicken.
Close the lid and bring it to boil on medium-low heat. Once boiling, skim the scum and foam on the surface.
Add the carrot and cook covered until tender, about 4-5 minutes.
Once the carrot is tender, add soy sauce and salt to the broth.
Add the shiitake mushrooms and well-drained cooked rice. Cover to cook for 10 minutes.
Beat the egg in a bowl.
Slowly drizzle a small amount of the beaten egg over the soup surface, which will create a fluffy texture.
Add some of the green onion and sesame seeds. Sprinkle white pepper powder at the end.

To Prepare the Chicken
Cut the chicken into 1 ½ inch pieces at a diagonal angle. The slanted surface gives each piece a flatter and more open surface so the chicken cooks evenly and faster. This cutting technique is called Sogigiri in Japanese.
Season the chicken with salt and freshly ground black pepper
To Blanch Broccoli
Cut off the broccoli florets and remove the tough skin of the stem and cut into small pieces.
Boil a pot of water and add salt. Start cooking the stem first for 1.5 to 2 minutes.
Then add the florets and cook for 2 minutes, or until almost tender but crisp. Remove from the water and let cool. You can shock the blanched broccoli in ice water to make it as bright green as possible, but since I add them to the stew anyway, I usually skip that extra step. But don’t overcook as we will reheat them in the stew.
To Prepare Other Ingredients
Cut the onion in half lengthwise and then into wedges. Tip: Separate each layer at this step, then you don't have to do it in the pot later.
Peel and cut the carrots at an angle into 1 ½ inch pieces, after rotating 90 degrees each time. This cutting technique is called Rangiri in Japanese.
Cut the potatoes into 1 ½ inch pieces. For these Yukon gold potatoes, I did not remove the skin.
Cut the mushroom stem and slice caps.
To Cook Ingredients
In a large pot (I used a 4 ½ QT pot), heat 1 Tbsp butter and 1 Tbsp olive oil over medium heat. If you're using a non-stick pot, you can omit the olive oil.
Add the chicken and sauté until 80% cooked through.
Add the onion and stir to cook until the chicken is no longer pink.
Add the potatoes and carrots and coat well with oil in the pot.
Add the chicken broth and 2 bay leaves.
The chicken broth doesn’t have to fully cover ingredients at this time as they will be eventually submerged when vegetables release moisture. Bring it to a boil on medium heat.
Once boiling, skim off the scum and foam and reduce heat to simmer.
Add mushrooms and simmer on a gentle heat, covered, for 10 minutes (set timer!).
To Make Bechamel Sauce (White Sauce)
Meanwhile (you have 10 minutes!), we make Bechamel Sauce. In a small saucepan, heat the butter and let it melt completely on medium-low heat. During this time, heat up the milk to warm to touch in the microwave or on the stove.
Add in the flour and stir constantly, without stopping.
The butter-flour mixture will swell and bubble. Continue to cook, stirring constantly, for the next 5 minutes. You want to make sure the flour is cooked and does not have raw flour taste.
Slowly and gradually add warm milk to the saucepan, one tablespoon at a time while you combine it with the butter-flour mixture.
Don’t hurry, and NEVER add too much liquid. You do not want to create lumps and once you get them, they are hard to fix.
The goal is to blend the mixture COMPLETELY before you add more liquid.
Add salt, white pepper, and nutmeg, and mix all together. Turn off the heat and set it aside.
To Combine White Sauce and Broth
After 10 minutes of simmering, open the lid.
Check the doneness by inserting a skewer into a potato. It should be tender, but don't overcook. It should not break easily. Scoop broth with a ladle.
Slowly pour the broth into the Bechamel sauce while stirring to blend together completely.
Add another ladle of broth and combine well. Now pour the white sauce back into the pot. Gently mix so that white sauce is well blended with the broth.
Add the heavy cream (if you’re using it) and season with salt to taste.
Simmer, uncovered, for another 5-10 minutes on low heat. [Optional Step] To improve the flavor, I highly encourage you to let the stew sit at the stove or counter to let cool to room temperature (keep the lid open). The stew will naturally thicken as the moisture evaporate and let the flavors meld as it cools.
Right before serving, add the blanched broccoli to the stew to reheat. Simmer on low heat and do not boil. Once everything is nice and warm, serve the stew. Enjoy it with steamed rice or crusty bread.

Add olive oil, sprinkle of kosher salt, and paprika.
Mix all together with your hands and spread out evenly in a single layer. Roast the corn kernels at 450ºF (230ºC) degrees for 15 minutes. Once it's done, remove it from the oven and set it aside till Step 8.
Meanwhile, thinly slice the onion against the grain. Heat the butter in a heavy-bottomed pot (thicker at the base so it absorbs and distributes heat better).
Add the sliced onion and pinch of kosher salt and sauté until translucent.
Add the roasted kernels and water.
Add the reserved cobs in the pot as they naturally sweeten the soup. Push the cobs down to see if they are covered with water. If not, add more water.
Bring to a boil over medium heat. Cover and lower the heat to medium-low heat and simmer for 15 minutes. During this time I highly recommend skimming the foam on the surface for more refined taste. After 15 minutes, discard the cobs.
Using an immersion blender, blend the soup until creamy and smooth. If you use a food processor or blender, let the soup cool for a few minutes before you start blending to avoid major splashes. Make sure to cover the hole with a towel when blending.
If you want to make your soup similar to corn potage (Japanese corn soup), strain the soup through a fine-mesh sieve for a smoother consistency.
Transfer the soup back to the pot and add heavy cream and milk. The ratio is entirely up to you. Here I used equal parts of milk and heavy cream, 1 cup each. Bring back to a simmer and cook uncovered for 10 minutes or more, stirring frequently. Once the water evaporates and it’ll be more flavorful.
Add kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper. Make sure to taste the soup when you season. Finely chop parsley. Serve the soup hot or chilled. You can drizzle olive oil and/or heavy cream and sprinkle the parsley to garnish.

Soaking the Oxtails
To completely remove blood from the bone, soak the oxtails in cold water for 1 hour and discard the water.
Prepare Vegetables
Meanwhile, cut the onions into wedges, chop celery stalks into small pieces, and cut the carrots into chunks.
Roughly cut the cabbage into 1 inch (2.5 cm) squares and rinse under running water.
Cut the tomatoes into wedges and cut them in halves. Cut Yukon gold potatoes into quarters and soak in water for 15 minutes to remove excess starch.
Cut the stew beef into smaller pieces.
Boiling the Oxtails
After soaking the oxtails in one hour, drain and place them in a large pot and cover it with cold water. Bring it to boil over medium-high heat. Once boiling, turn down the heat and simmer for 15 minutes. Using a fine-mesh sieve, skimming foam on the surface frequently. After simmering, take out the oxtail or drain the water. Blanching oxtails before cooking helps remove blood and impurities.
Sautéing the Ingredients
Press the “Saute” button on your Instant Pot (I use this 6 QT Instant Pot) and heat 1 ½ Tbsp olive oil.
Once the pot is hot, add the stew beef and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Sear the beef till brown on all sides. Don’t flip the pieces around until they release themselves. Transfer the meats to a plate from the pot.
Add the onion and celery and sauté until they are coated with oil and become tender. While sautéing, scrape the flavorful charred bits from the bottom of the pot. Add the tomatoes, carrots, and cabbage and coat them with oil.
When the vegetables are a bit wilted and soft, add the boiled oxtail, browned stew beef, and beef broth
Add tomato paste and Seasonings A (1 tsp paprika, 1 Tbsp dried basil, and 2 bay leaves).

Cut the potatoes into ¼ inch (6 mm) thick slabs and then cut into sticks. Soak the potatoes in water to remove the starch, for about 15 minutes.
Cut the onion into thin slices.
Cut the daikon into ¼ inch (6 mm) thick slabs and then cut into sticks.
Cut the carrot in half lengthwise, then cut into ¼ inch (6 mm) thick slices.
Scrape the gobo skin with the back of the knife. Gobo has a delicious earthy taste right below the skin; therefore, you do not use a peeler to peel off the soft skin. Cut the gobo in half lengthwise.
Thinly slice gobo diagonally. Soak in water for 15 minutes to get rid of the bitter taste. Optional: add a dollop of vinegar to the water to make the gobo white.
Cut the konnyaku into ¼ inch (6 mm) thick slabs, then cut into sticks.
Blanch the konnyaku in boiling water for 3 minutes to remove the smell. Drain konnyaku with a sieve.
Cut the pork belly slices into 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick pieces. Tip: If you freeze the meat for about ½ hour ahead of time, it is much easier to cut.
To Cook
All ingredients should be ready to go.
Press the “Sauté” button on your Instant Pot and heat 1 Tbsp cooking oil.
When the oil is hot, add the onion and coat with the oil. Then add the meat and stir to combine.
Add all the vegetables and konnyaku.
Stir to combine and then add in the dashi last.
Dashi should cover the ingredients. The vegetables will release moisture so don’t worry if you feel the soup is not enough at this stage. If dashi is not covering the ingredients, add more dashi (or water).
Press “Cancel” to stop the “Saute” menu. Close the lid and press the “Manual” or “Pressure Cook” menu. Then set HIGH pressure for 1 minute. Make sure the steam release handle points at “sealing” and not “venting”. The float valve goes up when pressurized.
While the ingredients in the soup are being cooked, you can cut the green onions and set aside.
When it’s finished cooking, the Instant Pot will switch automatically to the “Keep Warm” mode. Let the pressure release naturally for 30 minutes. If the valve hasn’t dropped yet, then quick release the air (be careful and cover your fingers with a mitten or kitchen towel).
Open the lid and check if the hard vegetables are tender.
Add miso. I used 8 Tbsp of Hikari Miso Enjuku Koji Miso.
Dissolve the miso in a ladle before releasing it to the soup. Make sure to taste the miso soup. If you added too much miso, add dashi (or water) to dilute. If it’s not enough, add more miso ½ Tbsp at a time.
To Serve
Pour the Tonjiru in a big bowl and sprinkle some green onions. Serve immediately. You can sprinkle shichimi togarashi or add a dollop of yuzu kosho for a spicy kick.
To Store
Let cool completely and store in the refrigerator for up to 3-4 days. When you reheat, make sure not to over boil the miso soup.

To make wonton soup, cut 1 green onion into 2 inch (5 cm) pieces. Add the chicken stock and the green onion in a large pot and bring to boil.
Once boiling, season with sesame oil, kosher salt, and white pepper powder. Turn off the heat and set aside.
To make fillings, chop 2 green onions into small rounds. Save some chopped green onion to serve with the soup.
Chop cilantro and set aside to serve with the soup.
Cut the shrimp into smaller pieces, and then cut them into even smaller pieces (almost like paste).
In a large bowl, combine the pork, shrimp, and chopped green onion. Grate fresh ginger and add to the mixture.
Add all the wonton seasoning ingredients to the mixture and mix well.
While you wrap wontons, bring a large pot of water to boil. Place a wonton wrapper on your hand. Place a teaspoon of the filling in the center of the wrapper. Start with a small amount so it’s easier to work with. Use your finger to moisten the edges of the wrapper with water.
When the edges have been moistened, fold the wrapper in half to create a rectangular shape, pressing any air that might be trapped around the filling. Fold the sides inward so that they overlap.
Wet the portion where the sides meet. Pinch to close and seal.
Here is the cute little wonton! Place the finished wontons on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Cover with plastic to keep them moist as you continue with the remaining fillings and wrappers.
To Serve
To cook wontons, put 5 to 10 wontons into a boiling water in a large pot. Depending on how big your pot is, you can add more/less wontons. Do not overcrowd the pot. Cook for 5 minutes, or until wontons float on the surface of the water and are tender and translucent. I boil wontons separately from the soup so it stays clear and clean.
Transfer wontons to serving bowls. Continue with the rest of the wontons. When you are done with cooking, pour some hot soup over wontons and garnish with chopped green onions and cilantro. Sprinkle some white pepper. You can also serve with soy sauce, chili sauce, etc.
To Store
To freeze the wontons, flash freeze for 1 hour (place them on a parchment-lined baking sheet covered with plastic wrap) and transfer them to a freezer bag. Keep in the freezer for up to 1-2 months. When you're ready to cook, do not defrost and cook frozen dumplings in boiling water for 12 minutes.
Leftover filling: Make mini meatballs or patties and cook them in a frying pan. Once they are pan fried, you can pack them in an airtight container and store in the freezer for later use.
Leftover wrappers: Wrap a small piece of cheese and pan fry or deep fry cheese wontons. They are kids’ favorite!",en-US,{},4.58,,Just One Cookbook,40,4 serving(s)
Pressure Cooker Oxtail Broth,Namiko Chen,https://www.justonecookbook.com/pressure-cooker-oxtail-broth/,Japanese,https://www.justonecookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Instant-Pot-Oxtail-Broth-w600.jpg,"['2.5 lb oxtail ((you can use up to 3 lbs/1.4 kg and add more water if necessary))', '6 cups water ((use cold for boiling oxtail))', '1 knob ginger ((1.5"", 3.8 cm))', '1 negi (long green onion) ((you can substitute it with several green onions))', '1 clove garlic', '8 cups water ((for cooking the broth))', '1 tsp kosher/sea salt (I use Diamond Crystal; Use half for table salt)']","Gather all the ingredients.
In a bowl, soak the oxtails in water for 1-2 hours. Change the water every half hour. This step will help removing blood from the oxtails.
Drain the water and transfer the oxtail to the Instant Pot.
Add 6 cups water (or just enough to cover the oxtail) and bring it to a boil. Instant Pot manual says not to cover when using Saute mode, but I use a glass lid from another pot (so I can see inside) and keep it covered until boiling. The lid is optional but it helps to speed up the boiling.
Press “Saute” button on your Instant Pot. Once boiling, remove the lid if using and cook for another 5-10 minutes.
Press the “Keep Warm/Cancel” button on the Instant Pot to stop “Saute” mode. Drain the water and clean the oxtail under running cold water. Set aside and clean the pot.
Cut the negi (or green onion) to separate green and white part. We only use green part for cooking the oxtail. Slice the ginger with skin on and smash the garlic.
In a cleaned pot, put the oxtail, negi (or green onion), ginger, and garlic.
Pour 8 cups water and add 1 tsp salt. Make sure the oxtail is submerged. If you use more than 2.5 lb oxtail, make sure that the water is not exceeding more than 2/3rd the capacity of the pressure cooker.
Cover and lock the lid on the pressure cooker. Make sure the steam release handle points at “sealing” and not “venting”. Press the “Manual” button to switch to “High Pressure” cooking mode. Press “plus” button to change the cooking time to 60 minutes.
If you’re using a stove-top pressure cooker, you won’t have any buttons to press. Just cook on high heat until high pressure is reached. Then reduce the heat to low but maintain high pressure for about 60 minutes.
When it is finished cooking, the Instant Pot will switch automatically to the “Keep Warm” mode. Let the pressure release naturally, about 15-20 minutes.
After de-pressurizing is completed, unlock the lid. Set a fine-mesh sieve over a large bowl and strain the broth. Discard the aromatics and add the meat back into the broth.
To Serve Now
You can’t get rid of the fat as much. Skim off the best you can. Use the broth and meat for the recipe you’re cooking. Otherwise, season the broth with salt (Tip: the right good amount of salt is important for taste). Serve the soup and meat in a bowl topped with green onion.
To Serve Later (Store Overnight)
Cover and let cool completely. Store in the refrigerator overnight (or at least 4 hours till fat solidified). Once the fat is solidified on the surface, remove the layer of fat. You can use it for other recipes or discard.
Transfer to the pot (or back to Instant Pot) and reheat the broth.
Use it for the recipe you’re cooking (and season accordingly). Or season with salt (Tip: the right good amount of salt is important for taste), and serve the soup with meat and chopped green onion or your choice of herbs.

To Prepare Ingredients
Clean the matsutake mushroom with damp paper towel. Because mushrooms act like a sponge, we try not to wash the mushroom. Shave off a thin sliver of the mushroom stem as if you are sharping a pencil with a knife. Cut into thin slices.
Tie mitsuba’s sprigs into a knot. If you use scallion, finely slice it.
To Make Dashi
Gently clean the dashi kombu with a damp cloth but leave the white powdery substances which contribute to the umami flavor in dashi. Do not wash the kombu.
In a medium pot, put the kombu in the water. Heat up slowly on medium-low heat. If you have time, soak for 3 hours ahead of time or preferably overnight. Kombu’s flavor comes out naturally from soaking in water.
When boiling, add the katsuobushi. Simmer for just 30 seconds and turn off the heat.
Strain the dashi through a fine-mesh sieve set over a bowl. Gently squeeze to release the extra dashi into the bowl.
To Make Soup
Transfer the dashi back to the saucepan and bring to a boil. Add the seasonings.
Cut tofu into small cubes and add to the soup. Then add sliced matsutake mushrooms and cook until ingredients are heated through, about 2-3 minutes.
Soak temari fu in water to hydrate. When temari fu is soft, squeeze water out and place it in a serving bowl.

Creamy Roasted Cauliflower Soup,Namiko Chen,https://www.justonecookbook.com/creamy-roasted-cauliflower-soup/,Japanese,https://www.justonecookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Creamy-Roasted-Cauliflower-Soup.jpg,"['1 head cauliflower', '2 Tbsp extra-virgin olive oil ((for roasting))', '2 tsp kosher/sea salt (I use Diamond Crystal; Use half for table salt) ((for roasting))', '⅛ tsp freshly ground black pepper ((for roasting))', '2 leeks ((white and light green parts only))', '5 mushrooms ((I use cremini))', '2 Tbsp unsalted butter', '2 cloves garlic', '1 bay leaf', '¼ tsp kosher/sea salt (I use Diamond Crystal; Use half for table salt) ((for sautéing leeks))', '1 tsp thyme', '3 Tbsp all-purpose flour (plain flour)', '2 cups milk ((I use whole milk))', '3 cups vegetable broth ((you can substitute with chicken broth))', 'kosher/sea salt (I use Diamond Crystal; Use half for table salt) ((to taste))', 'freshly ground black pepper ((to taste))', '½-1 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese', 'chives ((optional for garnish))', '1 tsp extra-virgin olive oil ((for garnish))']","Gather all the ingredients.
Preheat oven to 425°F (218°C). For a convection oven, reduce cooking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC). Cut the cauliflower into florets and place them on a large baking sheet.
Drizzle with 2 Tbsp olive oil and sprinkle 2 tsp kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper.
Toss so that the florets are lightly coated with oil. Spread the florets out into a single layer on the baking sheet. Place the cauliflower in the oven, uncovered, for 20-30 minutes, or until the top is lightly golden brown.
When the cauliflower is done roasting, set aside.
While cauliflower is in the oven, cut a quarter inch off the bottom of the leeks, removing the roots completely and then slice the leeks in half lengthwise.
Rinse each half under running water. Use your fingers to flex the leek and rinse any dirt or sand that may be clinging between the layers while still keeping the layers relatively intact. Line up the halves and cut into ½ inch (1.3 cm) pieces.
Clean the cremini mushrooms with a slightly damp paper towel or kitchen cloth to remove any dirt. Remember mushrooms absorb water like sponges, and they won't brown nicely when cooked if they absorb too much water. If you have to clean a lot of mushrooms, quickly rinse with running water and pat dry with a kitchen towel. Do not leave the mushrooms in water.
In a large pot (I use a Dutch oven), heat 2 Tbsp butter (28 g) on medium heat. Crush 2 cloves garlic (or add 2 cloves minced garlic) into the pot. Tear a bay leaf in half (for more aroma & flavor) and add to the pot.
Once the ingredients become fragrant, add the chopped leek and ¼ tsp kosher salt and sauté until tender. The salt will help the leeks become tender faster.
Once the leeks are tender, add the cremini mushrooms and fresh thyme. Pinch the stem near the top with the fingers of one hand. Pinch down the length of the stem with the fingers of the other hand from top to bottom and the leaves should break off where they meet the stem.
When the mushrooms are tender, add 3 Tbsp all-purpose flour. Continuously stir the bottom of the pan so that the flour doesn't burn.
When you don't see any bits of flour, gradually add 2 cups (480 ml) milk while stirring the bottom of the pan. Then add 3 cups (720 ml) vegetable broth.
Add the roasted cauliflower and bring to a low simmer, NEVER a full boil. Once the soup reached to a low simmer, cover and simmer for 20 minutes (once again, don't let it boil!). Note: when you add milk to the soup, you don't want to boil the soup; otherwise the milk will curdle. Using full fat milk helps prevent curdling.
Turn off the heat and remove bay leaf. Puree the soup until it reaches your desired consistency with an immersion blender (or you can transfer to a blender). If you use a regular blender, fill it no more than half way with the soup (do in batches). Place the lid on the blender and cover the hole with a towel. Start blending and slowly lift up the towel to let some of the steam escape.
Add ½ to 1 cup sharp cheddar cheese and stir until melted. Taste the soup and season with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to your taste. If you need to reheat the soup, bring the soup to a low simmer on medium low heat, not a full boil. Serve and top with chopped chives and a dash of olive oil. Enjoy!

Rinse rice and drain well. Place rice and water in the inner pot of the cooker. Close the lid.
Select [Rice] using [MENU] button and set the steam time to 8 minutes. Press [COOK] button. When cooking is completed, warming will start. Fluff up the rice with a rice scooper. Tip: Adjust cooking time and water according to personal taste.
To Prepare Ingredients
Gather all the ingredients. Once we start cooking, we don't have time to measure, so make sure to prepare the seasonings ahead of time (1 piece Japanese curry roux, 1 Tbsp curry powder, 1 tsp garam masala, 1 Tbsp tomato paste, 1 ½ Tbsp mango chutney, and 1 Tbsp honey).
Dice the onion (It doesn’t have to be perfect).
Cut the carrot into small pieces. I recommend using the ""rangiri"" Japanese cutting method to increase the surface. It’ll help cooking evenly and faster⅔, and absorbing more flavors.
Mince the garlic and grate the ginger.
Discard the bottom of the shimeji mushroom stem. Roughly separate the mushrooms.
Pat dry the chicken with paper towel to remove any moisture. Season the chicken with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper.
To Stir Fry
Set cooker to [BROWNING FRY, level 6] for 30 minutes (you can add more minutes later on if you need extra time).
Heat 1 Tbsp oil and brown the chicken, skin side down, for 5 minutes each side, or until golden brown. Don’t crowd the pot and brown the chicken in batches, if necessary.
After the bottom side is nicely brown, flip to cook the other side. Then transfer the chicken to a plate and continue with the next batch. Set aside.
Add the diced onion and 1 Tbsp unsalted butter. Sauté until translucent, about 7-8 minutes.
Add the garlic and ginger and mix all together.
Add 1 piece Japanese curry roux, 1 Tbsp curry powder, and 1 tsp garam masala. Give it a quick stir.
Add 1 Tbsp tomato paste and sauté until fragrant.
Add 1 Tbsp honey and 1 ½ Tbsp mango chutney and mix all together.
Gradually add half the chicken broth, scraping the brown bits on the bottom of the pot. Transfer the chicken back to the pot.
Add the carrots, shimeji mushrooms, and the rest of chicken broth.
Add 1 Tbsp dry basil and 1 bay leaf. Gently mix all together.
To Pressure Cook
Close the lid and set cooker to [MULTI COOK, level 9] for 35 minutes. For Instant Pot directions, see Notes.
Once the pressure cooking is done, open the lid and stir. Add 1 tsp kosher salt and 1 tsp soy sauce.
Taste and adjust the flavor.
To Deep Fry Vegetables (Optional)
Lotus root: Slice thinly and soak in water (or ideally 2 cups water + 1 tsp of rice vinegar) for 10 minutes.
Bell pepper: Remove the seeds and cut into 4 wedges.
Okra: Remove the hard corners and cut in half lengthwise.
Kabocha: Thinly slice the kabocha (cut in half if it’s too big). If the kabocha is too hard to cut, microwave for 30 seconds or more if it’s still hard.
Potato: Cut into 6 to 8 wedges and soak in water to remove starch for 10 minutes.
Eggplant: Right before deep frying (otherwise it’ll change color), cut the eggplants in half and cut the skin side in criss-cross pattern. This creates a nice design and helps to absorb more flavors.
Make sure to remove moisture from all the vegetables with paper towel or kitchen towel before frying.
Add 1 cup of oil in a frying pan (I used a cast iron pan) or pot. Deep/shallow fry the vegetables at 350ºF (175ºC) and drain the excess oil on a paper towel or a wire rack.
To Serve
Serve the steamed rice in a small bowl or plate and the soup curry in a bowl. Top the soup curry with deep-fried vegetables. When you eat, pick up some rice with a spoon, and scoop soup curry. Enjoy!

Mix all together with your hands and spread out evenly in a single layer. Roast the corn kernels at 450ºF (230ºC) degrees for 15 minutes. Once it's done, remove it from the oven and set it aside till Step 8.
Meanwhile, thinly slice the onion against the grain. Heat the butter in a heavy-bottomed pot (thicker at the base so it absorbs and distributes heat better).
Add the sliced onion and pinch of kosher salt and sauté until translucent.
Add the roasted kernels and water.
Add the reserved cobs in the pot as they naturally sweeten the soup. Push the cobs down to see if they are covered with water. If not, add more water.
Bring to a boil over medium heat. Cover and lower the heat to medium-low heat and simmer for 15 minutes. During this time I highly recommend skimming the foam on the surface for more refined taste. After 15 minutes, discard the cobs.
Using an immersion blender, blend the soup until creamy and smooth. If you use a food processor or blender, let the soup cool for a few minutes before you start blending to avoid major splashes. Make sure to cover the hole with a towel when blending.
If you want to make your soup similar to corn potage (Japanese corn soup), strain the soup through a fine-mesh sieve for a smoother consistency.
Transfer the soup back to the pot and add heavy cream and milk. The ratio is entirely up to you. Here I used equal parts of milk and heavy cream, 1 cup each. Bring back to a simmer and cook uncovered for 10 minutes or more, stirring frequently. Once the water evaporates and it’ll be more flavorful.

Miso Soup,Namiko Chen,https://www.justonecookbook.com/homemade-miso-soup/,Japanese,https://www.justonecookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Homemade-miso-soup-6037-I-3.jpg,"['4 cups water', '1 piece kombu (dried kelp) ((⅓ oz, 10 g; 4"" x 4"" or 10 x 10 cm))', '1 cup katsuobushi (dried bonito flakes) ((packed; I used loose 3 cups in the video for strong dashi flavor))', '1 cup dashi (Japanese soup stock; click to learn more)', '1 Tbsp miso ((18 g))', 'Ingredients of your choice ((Please read the blog post))', 'green onion/scallion ((finely chopped))']","To Make Dashi (Can be Made in Advance):
Clean the kombu with a damp towel and soak the kombu in water for 30 minutes or overnight (preferred). NEVER wash kombu and do not remove the white substance -that’s umami! These days it's pretty clean, so you can skip this process. Just make sure there are no dirty particles.
After 30 minutes (or overnight), the kombu is rehydrated. This liquid is called cold brew Kombu Dashi.
Pour kombu dashi and kombu into a saucepan. SLOWLY bring to boil on medium-low heat so you can extract umami from kombu as much as possible. Right before the stock is boiling (it gets slimy and yields a bitter taste if you leave it), remove the kombu. Now what you have is Kombu Dashi. If you’re vegetarian/vegan, use this kombu dashi for your miso soup. What to do with used kombu? You can reuse it to make Simmered Kombu or Homemade Furikake Rice Seasoning.
If you're not vegetarian/vegan, add Katsuobushi and let it simmer for 30-60 seconds. Turn off the heat and let steep for 10 minutes.
Strain over a fine-mesh sieve and now you have roughly 4 cups of Awase Dashi. You can store in the refrigerator for up to 3-5 days and in the freezer for up to 2 weeks. Repurpose the used katsuobushi to make Homemade Furikake Rice Seasoning.
STEP 1 - Add Dashi
Here I demonstrate to make 2 cups/2 servings of miso soup. You can use the formula; 1 cup (200-240 ml) dashi + 1 Tbsp (18 g) miso = 1 serving miso soup. If you add more ingredients/vegetables, the amount of soup will increase and you will also need more miso. Add 2 cups (480 ml) dashi in the saucepan.
Are you in a hurry and no time to make dashi? You can use Dashi Packet or Dashi Powder to make instant dashi.
STEP 2 - Add dense ingredients BEFORE bringing dashi to a boil
If your miso soup doesn't include hard ingredients or clams, go to the next step. Add hard ingredients like root vegetables. Once boiling, lower the heat and simmer until they become tender. If you're making Clam Miso Soup, add clams in cold brew kombu dashi. Bring it to a gentle boil and once the shells are open, turn off the heat (do not overcook).
STEP 3- Add quick-cooking ingredients AFTER dashi is boiling
If your miso soup doesn’t include these ingredients, bring dashi to a boil and go to next step. AFTER dashi starts boiling, add in soft vegetables like leafy greens, mushrooms, deep-fried tofu pouch because they require less cooking time. At this point, keep the soup at a simmer and make sure it stays warm (not OVERBOILING).
STEP 4 - Add miso
Add a small amount of miso at a time (you can start with 2 Tbsp miso for 2 cups dashi). Put miso inside a ladle and slowly add dashi into the ladle to dissolve miso completely. You can buy a miso muddler or a fine-mesh miso strainer which helps you dissolve miso faster. If you accidentally added too much miso, dilute the miso soup with dashi (or water). NEVER OVERBOIL miso soup because it loses nutrients, flavors, and fragrance.
STEP 5 - Add tofu
Add tofu AFTER miso is completely dissolved because you might break the tofu when mixing in miso. If you add chilled tofu from the refrigerator, miso soup would get cooler. Reheat miso soup until it is just hot, but NOT BOIL.
STEP 6 - Add wakame & green onions
Add rehydrated wakame (seaweed). I recommend re-hydrating dried wakame in a separate bowl of water to get rid of saltiness, instead of re-hydrating inside miso soup. Add ingredients that do not require cooking such as chopped green onions, mitsuba, yuzu, and blanched spinach right before serving to keep the fresh fragrance and color.
To Serve:
Serve immediately. Place on the right side of the table setting (Read on Ichiju Sansai, or 1 soup 3 dishes; see the picture).
To Store:
In general, it's best to use up all the miso soup because the fragrance and taste will be lost as time passes by. Let your miso soup cool at room temperature (up to 4 hours - otherwise miso soup will be spoiled) and then refrigerate. You can keep for up to 2 days in the refrigerator. If you want to make a big batch, it's best to keep the soup BEFORE adding miso. Add the miso only for the portion you need. You can freeze miso soup for up to 2 weeks. If the miso soup contains potatoes or tofu, remove them before freezing as the textures subject to change.

Mille-Feuille Nabe,Namiko Chen,https://www.justonecookbook.com/mille-feuille-nabe/,Japanese,https://www.justonecookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Mille-Feuille-Nabe-0545-I.jpg,"['1 napa cabbage', '1 ½ lb sliced pork belly', '1 knob ginger ((1"", 2.5 cm))', '5 cups dashi (Japanese soup stock; click to learn more)', '2 Tbsp sake', '1 Tbsp soy sauce', '½ tsp kosher/sea salt (I use Diamond Crystal; Use half for table salt)', '1 green onion/scallion', 'ponzu', 'shichimi togarashi (Japanese seven spice)']","Gather all the ingredients.
Slice the ginger and thinly cut green onion/scallion. Keep the ginger on the side and put the green onion in a small serving bowl.
Cut the napa cabbage into quarters lengthwise. Without cutting the edge, wash the leaves carefully and drain well. Don’t throw away the leaves that naturally came off while rinsing. We’ll use these leaves later on.
Place each slice of pork belly between the napa cabbage leaves. If you have extra pork belly, you can put an additional slice in outer layers which have wide leaves. If the pork belly is too long for the napa cabbage, you can trim with a kitchen shear and place it in other parts of the napa cabbage.
Once the pork belly slices are nicely tucked in, cut the napa cabbage into 3-4 pieces, about 2 to 2 ½ inches (5-6 cm).
Start packing the layers of napa cabbage/pork belly from the outer edges of donabe (or hot pot or regular pot) and work your way towards the center. The napa cabbage/pork belly layers should be packed tightly as they become loose once it starts cooking.
If you don’t have enough layers, you might want to consider a smaller pot (remember the size of your napa cabbage and proportional pot size you used for next time) or place other ingredients in the center. Here I stuffed the center with napa cabbage leaves that came off while rinsing and cutting the napa cabbage. You can also put enoki mushrooms or shimeji mushrooms in the center.
Combine the soup ingredients (5 cups dashi, 2 Tbsp sake, 1 Tbsp soy sauce, slices of 1-inch ginger, and ½ tsp kosher salt). Don’t cut down on the salt as napa cabbage releases liquid when it's being cooked and will dilute the soup a little bit.
Pour the soup into the pot and start cooking on high heat. Once boiling, skim the foam and fat on the surface. Then reduce the heat to medium-low heat and cook until napa cabbage is tender and pork belly is cooked through, roughly 8-10 minutes.
Serve hot with ponzu, green onion/scallion, and shichimi togarashi (Japanese seven spice).

To Prepare Hot Pot Broth
In your donabe (earthenware pot) or a large pot, add 3 cups (720 ml) dashi, ¼ cup (60 ml) sake, and ¼ cup (60 ml) mirin. Cover and bring the soup to a boil on medium heat.
Once boiling, add 2 cups (480 ml) warm soy milk. On medium heat, slowly heat up until the soup almost boils. Keep the lid uncovered and stir once in a while. Meanwhile, grind 2 Tbsp toasted sesame seeds in a pestle and mortar.
Once the soup is hot, add ¼ cup (4 Tbsp) miso and ground sesame seeds.
Taste the soup and add kosher salt if you like it saltier. Depends on the brands and types of miso, the saltiness of your soup will vary. I recommend making the soup a little bit saltier since you’ll add vegetables that will release water and dilute the soup. Turn off the heat and set aside. Keep it covered.
Hot Pot Ingredients: If your meat is not thinly sliced, you have to cut it thinly on your own. See how to do it (picture is thinly sliced beef).
Cut off and discard the bottom of enoki mushrooms and shimeji mushrooms.
Cut off and discard the shiitake stem. If you like, make a decorative cut on shiitake mushrooms.
Cut napa cabbage into 2” (5 cm) pieces widthwise. Then cut into 2-3 pieces lengthwise on the thick and white bottom part of napa cabbage so that it’ll be faster to cook.
Cut Mizuna (or spinach) and shungiku into 2” (5 cm) pieces.
Cut negi (long green onion or leek) into 1” (2.5 cm) thick pieces diagonally. Thinly slice green onion/scallion.
Cut the tofu block into 1” (2.5 cm) slices.
Using a vegetable peeler, peel the daikon and carrot thinly as if you are peeling their skin. You can cut these root vegetables into thinly rounds or quarters, but my family loves eating root vegetables in long paper-thin form.
Peel the gobo (burdock root) same way as daikon and carrot. Soak the thinly sliced gobo in water for 15 minutes to prevent them from changing color.
Put all the vegetables, mushrooms, and tofu in a platter.
Start cooking some of the tough/dense vegetables (the tough part of napa cabbage leaves, negi, tofu, mushrooms, daikon, carrot, and gobo) over medium heat, saving some for later batch as well as the leafy vegetables that will cook fast. Cover the lid so it will cook faster. Once the broth is simmering, reduce the heat to medium-low heat so the broth won't curdle. Simmer for 10 minutes, but make sure you won't let it boil. You can either start serving food that’s cooked. Root vegetables take a longer time to cook. Add the meat and leafy vegetables and cover to cook until the meat is no longer pink. Using a fine-mesh skimmer, skim any curdles floating on the soup. You can eat the curdle or discard it.
To Eat
Each person should have a small bowl of ponzu sauce and chopped scallions. Dip the cooked meat and vegetables in ponzu sauce to enjoy! Keep cooking the ingredients in the pot as you enjoy the meal.

Gather all the ingredients for Chanko Nabe Broth.
To make the broth, in a Dutch oven or other large pot over medium heat, combine the broth, sake, mirin, ginger juice, and garlic and bring to a simmer.
Spoon several spoonfuls of broth into a small bowl, add the miso, and stir until smooth.
Gradually add the miso mixture to the broth in the pot, stirring to avoid lumps. Once the miso has been incorporated, do not let the broth boil.
To make the chicken meatballs:
Gather all the ingredients. This grater (I have 6"" one) works great for grating ginger (daikon, garlic, etc) and keeping the juice from grating it. In this recipe, we only use ginger juice.
In a large bowl, combine the chicken, ½ beaten egg (reserve the remaining egg for another use), the ginger juice, soy sauce, corn starch, panko, and green onion. Using your hands, mix all together.
Once the mixture becomes a little bit white and well combined, shape the mixture into a ball. Sprinkle with panko as needed.
To cut all the ingredients:
Cut the cod fillet into 2-inch chunks, peel and devein shrimp, cut the sliced pork belly into 2-inch pieces, trim the visible fat from the chicken thighs and cut into bite-sized pieces, cut the tofu into 1-inch cubes, and separate the leaves from napa cabbage and cut them into smaller pieces. Slice the carrot and cut out with a flower-shaped vegetable cutter.
Cut negi (long green onion) diagonally into 1-inch-thick pieces, cut the green onions into 2-inch lengths, and remove stems of shiitake mushrooms and make a decorative cut on the caps if desired.
To set up the table:
To prepare the stew ingredients, place the meatballs, seafood, pork belly, chicken, tofu, carrot slices, napa cabbage, long green onion, green onions, and mushrooms on the platter.
Pour the ponzu sauce and sesame sauce (goma dare) into individual dipping bowls at each place setting along with chopsticks, a soup spoon (optional) and a soup bowl.
Place a portable gas burner and the nabe, and the stew ingredients on the table. If you don’t have a gas/electric burner, you can cook the stew on the stovetop, transfer it to a large bowl, and serve it family style.
To cook Chanko Nabe:
If cooking the stew ingredients on the stovetop, cook in batches. Add some of each of the ingredients to the broth, simmer (do not boil) until cooked, and serve them, returning to the stove to start a new batch as each previous batch is eaten. The vegetables and tofu cook more quickly than the meatballs, seafood, and chicken.
Keep the broth at a simmer the entire time. If the liquid gets low, add a little water or chicken broth to have enough liquid to heat the noodles or rice at the end (even though you are thinning the broth, the flavorful ingredients you are cooking in it continue to enrich it).
When diners are ready, remove any solids in the broth and add the noodles or rice. Simmer until heated through, then ladle into the soup bowls and serve.",en-US,{},4.47,,Just One Cookbook,60,6 serving(s)

To Make Homemade Ponzu and Sesame Sauce
If you are going to make homemade sesame and ponzu sauces, follow the recipe links in the ingredient list. You can make the sauces ahead of time.
To Prepare Broth
Fill a donabe (or Dutch oven or any large pot) two-thirds full with water. Add kombu and soak in water for at least 30 minutes. Meanwhile, you can prepare ingredients. The right image shows the kombu dashi broth after 30 minutes.
To Prepare Ingredients
Prepare udon noodles according to the instructions. Put frozen udon in boiling water and reheat for 1 minute. Transfer to iced water to stop cooking with remaining heat, and drain well. Serve on a plate and set aside. You'll add udon noodles to the donabe after all the ingredients are cooked and eaten.
Cut napa cabbages into 2-inch (5 cm) pieces, and then cut each piece into half or thirds.
Cut the shungiku into 2-inch (5 cm) pieces.
We only use the white part of negi (green onion/leeks). Cut it diagonally into ½ inch (1.3 cm) thick pieces.
Rinse enoki and shimeji mushrooms. Discard the bottom of both mushrooms and separate into smaller chunks.
Cut the stem of shiitake mushrooms and do a decorative cutting (optional).
Cut the carrot into ¼ inch rounds. If you like, you can use a vegetable cutter to create a flower shape.
Cut the tofu into 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick square pieces.
Arrange all the ingredients on a serving platter.
Peel daikon and grate using the grater (I love and use this one all the time). Squeeze grated daikon gently and put in a small bowl.
Cut the green onions into thin rounds and put it in a bowl.
Prepare shichimi togarashi in a bowl (optional). Lay the thinly sliced beef on a plate.
To Cook Shabu Shabu
Set a portable gas burner and put the donabe on the stove. Place platters with ingredients on the table. Give each person a ponzu sauce and sesame sauce. I also like to prepare an additional bowl for each person so they can use it to cool the food.
Bring the broth to a simmer over medium heat. Take out the kombu right before water starts to boil (otherwise, the water gets slimy).
Add the tofu, the tough part of napa cabbage and shungiku, negi, carrots, and some mushrooms. You don’t have to put all the ingredients and cook in batches. Cover to cook for 10 minutes.
To Eat Shabu Shabu
While you’re waiting for the food to cook, prepare your dipping sauces. Add grated daikon, shichimi togarashi, and green onion in ponzu, and green onion in sesame sauce.
When you want to eat meat, pick up a slice of thinly sliced beef with a set of communal chopsticks and stir the meat in the boiling broth to cook for 20-30 seconds, or until the meat is no longer pink. Do not overcook the meat.
Take out the cooked beef and vegetables from the pot when they are done, and dip the food in ponzu or sesame sauce.
Add remaining ingredients in the boiling broth as needed and simmer for a few minutes. Skim off the scum and foam from the surface as you cook. Prepare a fine mesh skimmer and a 2-cup measuring cup or bowl filled with water at the table so you can easily skim as you cook. Water in the measuring cup will help you get rid of scum from the skimmer. We want to keep the broth as clean as possible.
When all the ingredients are cooked, skim the broth for udon noodles. Typically, a hot pot meal ends with cooking udon noodles or porridge.
Add udon noodles in the pot and reheat for 1-2 minutes. Lightly season the udon soup with salt and white pepper, if you like (optional).
