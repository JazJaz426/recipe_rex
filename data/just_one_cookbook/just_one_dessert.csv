Cherry Blossom Milk Pudding,Namiko Chen,https://www.justonecookbook.com/cherry-blossom-milk-pudding/,Japanese,https://www.justonecookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Cherry-Blossom-Milk-Pudding-3669-I.jpg,"['2 sheets gelatin sheets ((5 g))', '3 Tbsp hot water', '⅔ cup whole milk', '⅓ cup sugar', '½ cup plain yogurt ((I used low fat))', '¾ cup heavy (whipping) cream', '8 salt pickled cherry blossoms', '1 sheet gelatin sheet', '1 ½ Tbsp hot water', '½ cup water', '2 tsp sugar', 'red food coloring ((optional))']","Gather all the ingredients.
Put the salt pickled cherry blossoms in a small bowl and add water to cover the flowers. Let them soak for at least 30 minutes to remove the saltiness from the flowers.
To Make Milk Pudding
Cut 2 gelatin sheets into thin strips and put in a small bowl. Pour 3 Tbsp. hot water and stir until the gelatin has dissolved completely. If it’s not completely dissolved, microwave for 30 seconds and mix.
In a small saucepan, heat ⅔ cup (160 ml) milk and ⅓ cup (70 g) granulated sugar over medium heat. Stir continuously until the sugar has dissolved.
When the milk is about to boil, turn off the heat (don’t let it boil!) and add the gelatin. Mix well and set aside.
In a medium bowl, combine ½ cup (120 g) plain yogurt, ¾ cup (180 ml) heavy cream. Mix well to combine.
Slowly add the milk mixture to the yogurt mixture while you stir.
Run the mixture through a fine mesh sieve/strainer to achieve silky smooth texture.
To speed up the process for solidify the milk pudding, fill up half of a large bowl with iced water. Place the bowl with mixture in the ice bath. It will take at least 30 minutes till the mixture becomes thicker and syrupy.
Once the mixture gets thicker, pour to individual serving cups. Keep them in the refrigerator till the milk pudding sets, about 30-60 minutes.
To Make Cherry Blossom Jelly/Jello
Start this process only after your milk pudding has set. Cut 1 gelatin sheet into thin strips and put in a small bowl. Pour 1 ½ Tbsp. hot water and stir until the gelatin is dissolved completely. If it doesn’t get dissolved, microwave it for 20 seconds and mix.
In a small saucepan, heat ½ cup (120 ml) water and 2 tsp sugar over medium heat and whisk until the sugar has dissolved completely.
Gently squeeze water out of the salt pickled cherry blossoms and add them in the saucepan. Turn off the heat.
Add the gelatin and give a quick mix and then add a tiny bit of red food coloring. If you want nice light pink color, add only tiny bit. You can always add a little more if you want it to be a darker red.
Mix well so that color is evenly distributed. Place the saucepan over iced bath and let the mixture cool. This will make the mixture syrupy and thick.
To Assemble
Once the mixture is slightly thicker, pick up the stem of the blossoms and gently place it on top of the milk pudding. Pour the mixture to cover the cherry blossoms on top of milk pudding.
If you want the cherry blossoms to look bloomed, scoop the flower with the liquid mixture in a big spoon and pour onto top of the milk pudding.
Keep in the refrigerator till the top layer is set (about an hour). Garnish the milk pudding with mint leaves and serve it chilled.",en-US,{},4.93,,Just One Cookbook,100,4 serving(s)

Set a heatproof bowl over a saucepan of simmering water (140F/60C) and add the chocolate. Stir occasionally until the chocolate is melted.
Add the coarsely chopped butter and let it melted completely. Transfer the bowl to the counter and let the mixture cool.
Separate the cold eggs, putting the whites in a mixer bowl or other large bowl and the yolks in a small bowl.
While the chocolate is cooling, place the egg whites in a clean bowl with a pinch of salt. Working with the whisk attachment of the mixer, beat the egg whites until they are foamy and start adding half of the sugar (3oz/90g) in 2-3 separate additions.
Continue to beat on high speed until stiff peaks form and sugar is dissolved (about 5 min total). To test for stiff peaks, the peaks should stand straight up when you lift up the beaters. The whites should not slide around. Transfer the meringue into a bowl and wash the mixing bowl for next step.
In the clean mixing bowl, beat the egg yolks and the rest of sugar (3oz/90g) until creamy and stir in the heavy whipping cream.
With a rubber spatula stir the chocolate mixture into the egg mixture.
Then add the flour and cocoa powder into the mixture.
Using the spatula, stir about 1/3 of the meringue into the batter, then gently fold in the rest until the color is uniform.
Pour the batter into the pan and give the pan several sharp taps on the counter to bring up any air bubbles that may be trapped in the batter.

Black Sesame Cookies,Namiko Chen,https://www.justonecookbook.com/sesame-cookies/,Japanese,https://www.justonecookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Sesame-Cookies-1546-I-2.jpg,"['½ cup unsalted butter ((measure ½ cup (8Tbsp, 1 stick) + ½ Tbsp to be precise))', '1 ⅓ cup all-purpose flour (plain flour)', ""¼ cup almond meal ((¼ cup + 4 tsp to be precise; I used Trader Joe's almond meal))"", '6 Tbsp sugar', '⅛ tsp kosher/sea salt (I use Diamond Crystal; Use half for table salt)', '5 Tbsp toasted black sesame seeds', '1 large egg yolk']","Gather all the ingredients.
To Make the Dough
Cut the butter into small cubes and keep them refrigerated until ready to use (I cut on parchment paper and wrap up the butter for easy transfer.).
In the food processor, combine the flour, almond meal, sugar, and salt. If you don’t have a food processor, you can simply use a bowl to mix all the ingredients.
If you want your sesame seeds to be of fine texture, add them now. If you prefer to keep the original shape of sesame seeds, add them with egg yolk later on.
Take out the butter from the refrigerator and mix together. If you use a regular bowl to mix, use a dough/pastry blender to combine the butter into the dry ingredients.
Lastly, add egg yolk.
If the food processor is small (like mine) and it doesn’t look like it’s mixed completely, take it out and mix well with a silicone spatula.
Form the dough into a ball and cut in half.
Roll it to a log approximately 2” (5 cm) across. For me, it’s easier to work when the dough is wrapped in plastic wrap. While rolling, unwrap some parts of plastic wrap then roll again. Form a nice shape. I wasn't paying attention so my log is flat on one side...
To Chill the Dough
Wrap the logs tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, at least an hour (you can put them in the freezer to speed up the process as well).
To Bake
Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). For a convection oven, reduce cooking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC). Remove the dough from plastic wrap and cut into discs about ¼ inch (6 mm) thick (if you prefer thicker cookies, cut into discs about ½ inch (1.3 cm) and you get 20 cookies total).
Place them on two baking sheets lined with parchment paper. Bake for about 15 minutes, or until lightly browned around the edges. If you are baking in batches, make sure to keep the second batch in the refrigerator to chill until baking.
Remove from the oven and allow to cool on the baking sheet for about 10 minutes. Then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.

In a large bowl, combine eggs, sugar, and honey and whisk well until the mixture becomes fluffy.
Sift flour and baking powder into the bowl and mix all together. Keep in the fridge to rest for 15 minutes.
The batter should be slightly smoother now. Stir in 1 Tbsp of water. Depends on the size of eggs and how accurate your flour measurement is, the water amount may vary but it should be 1-2 Tbsp.
Heat a large non-stick frying pan over medium-low heat (close to low). It's best to take your time and heat slowly. I keep the heat setting to the lowest for 5 minutes. Dip a paper towel in vegetable oil and coat the bottom of the pan with the oil. Then remove the oil completely (that's the key for evenly golden brown dorayaki surface). With a ladle or a small measuring cup (I use a 4 Tbsp measuring cup), pour 3 Tbsp of the batter from 3"" (8 cm) above the pan to create 3"" (8 cm) diameter pancakes.
When you see the surface of the batter starting to bubble, flip over and cook the other side. With my stovetop and frying pan, it takes 1 minute and 15-30 seconds to cook one side and 20-30 seconds on the other side). Transfer to a plate and cover up with a damp towel to prevent from drying. You do not need to oil the pan again. Continue making pancakes (you can make about 12 pancakes).
Make sandwich with red bean paste. Put more red bean paste in the center so the shape of dorayaki will be curved (middle part should be thicker). Wrap dorayaki with plastic wrap until ready to serve.

Basque Burnt Cheesecake,Namiko Chen,https://www.justonecookbook.com/basque-burnt-cheesecake/,American,https://www.justonecookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Basque-Burnt-Cheesecake-2523-2.jpg,"['1 lb cream cheese ((226 g x 2 blocks; I used Philadelphia; at room temperature))', '½ cup sugar', '3 large eggs (50 g each w/o shell) ((at room temperature))', '2 Tbsp cake flour ((you can use all-purpose flour; use rice flour for gluten-free))', '2 tsp cornstarch ((you can substitute with flour))', '1 cup heavy (whipping) cream ((36-38% fat; at room temperature))', '1 Tbsp lemon juice', '⅛ tsp kosher/sea salt (I use Diamond Crystal; Use half for table salt)']","Gather all the ingredients.
To Preheat the Oven
Preheat the convection oven (with fan) to 450ºF (230ºC). If you don’t have an oven with fan, preheat the conventional oven to 475ºF (245ºC). If your oven doesn’t get hot very well, you can preheat to the hottest oven temperature (mine is 550ºF (290ºC)) for 30-60 minutes. As for the oven rack, I used the middle rack for the convection oven (the fan circulates the air, so the middle rack is ideal). If you use the conventional oven, move the rack slightly higher as heat rises and the top of the oven is higher temperature. However, keep in mind that a 3-inch deep cake pan needs extra space for rising.
To Prepare the Cake Pan
Line a 6-inch (15-cm) round cake pan with 2 large sheets of parchment paper. When you cut 2 sheets of parchment papers, leave at least 2 inches (5 cm) of overhang around all edges. Fold the parchment paper twice to find the center of the paper.
Overlap 2 sheets of parchment paper so the cross/center matches and place them over in the middle of the pan. Make sure the longer side is against each other. Place the removable bottom on top.
Press down the removable bottom and the parchment paper, creasing against the bottom of the cake pan to fit snugly in the pan. Press the paper around the cake pan too.
Gently take out the removable bottom and the parchment-paper “mold”. Place the removable bottom back into the cake pan (as it should be). Then place the parchment-paper “mold” into the cake pan. Press the paper down to fit perfectly.
To Make the Batter
Make sure the cream cheese is at room temperature. If not, microwave the cold cream cheese at half power (50%) for 45 seconds, or microwave at 15 seconds incremental.
Press down the cream cheese and make it soft. Then add sugar.
Combine cream cheese with sugar by rubbing the mixture with the spatula against the bowl. The cream cheese will become fluffy and smooth as the sugar granules disappear.
Scrape both bowl and spatula often to ensure that nothing sticks to them and that there are no lumps.
Crack eggs in another bowl and whisk well.
Slowly and gradually add the beaten egg 3 separate times. Don’t add the egg until the batter is smooth and with no lumps.
In each addition, blend it with cream cheese COMPLETELY and THOROUGHLY.
Add the rest of the egg and blend well.
Scrap off the batter from the bowl and spatula and make sure there are no lumps in the batter. Then add lemon juice.
Sift the cake flour and cornstarch a little bit as you stir and blend together. Then sift more and continue as you finish sifting and blending in all the flour. Take your time to do this. You don’t want any lumps.
Add salt and blend together. Make sure at this stage (before adding heavy cream – more liquid) that there are no lumps.
Gradually add heavy cream while you stir. Mix until it’s all combined.
Pour the cake batter into the prepared pan in one go (avoid stop-and-go) so the air pockets don’t go in. Tap the cake pan on the countertop a few times.
With a bamboo skewer or toothpick, pop the air bubbles if there are any, and then run the batter with it to remove any bubbles. If you’re not sure if the cheesecake may overflow, bake the cheesecake on a baking sheet, just in case. Mine never did, but I use it as it’s easier to transfer the cake pan from and to the oven.
To Bake
Transfer the cake pan to the oven and bake at 450ºF (230ºC) (or 475ºF (245ºC) if conventional oven) until the top is dark amber/brown and the center is still very jiggly, about 30-35 minutes (please keep an eye on your cheesecake because every oven is different). My top doesn’t start becoming dark until a 30-minute mark, then within 5 minutes, it starts to get dark brown. If you love the “gooey/ oozy” texture and bake for a less amount of time than I provided, then you must chill before serving. NEVER overcook the cake by extending the bake time, even though the top doesn't turn dark. The texture of the filling will become curdled and you can't fix it. You probably need to adjust the oven temperature (or oven rack or preheating time) next time you make it.
To Cool
Take out the cake when the surface is dark, burnt color. The cake should wobble when you gently shake the pan. Let the cheesecake cool in the pan on a wire rack until it reaches room temperature, about 2-3 hours. Don’t put it on the countertop directly and make sure the air can go through under the cake pan. You can place it on top of the stovetop, if it's is not in use.
To Chill
You can skip chilling and serve at room temperature (which we like, too). If you prefer to serve chilled cheesecake or a firmer cheesecake, place the cheesecake, covered in cloth (don’t use plastic, as condensation may drop onto the cake), in the refrigerator for 4 hours.
To Serve
Remove the cheesecake from the cake pan and carefully peel back the parchment paper. If you have chilled the cake, let stand at room temperature for at least 30 minutes or up to 2 hours before serving.
To Store
You can store the cheesecake in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.",en-US,"{'calories': '3043 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '141 g', 'proteinContent': '52 g', 'fatContent': '258 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '147 g', 'transFatContent': '1 g', 'cholesterolContent': '1383 mg', 'sodiumContent': '1901 mg', 'fiberContent': '1 g', 'sugarContent': '116 g', 'servingSize': '1 serving'}",4.49,,Just One Cookbook,300,1 serving(s)

Preheat the oven to 340ºF (170ºC). For a convection oven, reduce cooking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC). You will also need a 17cm (7"") chiffon cake pan. Make sure you use the correct chiffon cake pan. The best types are the aluminum ones with a removable base (Do not use non-stick bakeware for chiffon cake – it will not work). Do not grease the mold because the cake needs to cling on the sides and center of the pan for support as it rises or it will collapse.
Separate 3 eggs to yolks and whites. Keep the egg yolks in a medium bowl, and egg whites in a large bowl. Freeze the large bowl with egg whites for 15 minutes so that the bowl and egg whites are very cold (it's okay that they are partially frozen when you beat the egg whites). NOTE: In Japan, cream of tartar is not typically used to whip egg whites. We always use cold egg whites to make smooth, fine-texture meringue.
Crush the cardamom pods and remove the shell. Grind the seeds till fine powder. You will need ½ tsp finely ground cardamom.
Zest the oranges (I use 3-4 navel oranges). As I mentioned in the blog post, I use 2 types of zesters for more texture and flavors. Reserve some of the zest strips for cake decoration.
Cut the oranges in half and juice until you get 4 Tbsp (60 ml) of fresh orange juice.
In the bowl with egg yolks, add roughly ⅓ of granulated sugar and whisk until creamy pale yellow.
Add 3 Tbsp (40 ml) vegetable/canola oil, ½ tsp ground cardamom, and orange zest from 3-4 oranges and whisk well.
Add 4 Tbsp (60 ml) juice from oranges to the egg mixture and whisk well.
Sift 75 g (2.6 oz) cake flour and 1 tsp baking powder into the egg mixture. Whisk until incorporated and make sure there are no lumps.
Take out the bowl with egg whites from the freezer. Whip the egg whites until opaque, foamy, and bubbly.
Gradually add the rest of sugar in small increments while whisking.
Continue to whisk until stiff peaks form.
To check on stiff peaks, pull up your whisk and see if the egg whites go straight up (stiff peak) and just the tip is soft enough that it folds over, like taking a bow.
Using a whisk, whisk in ⅓ of the egg whites in the batter until the mixture is homogeneous.
Fold in another ⅓ of the egg whites into the batter. This time, fold in gently without breaking the air bubbles.
Now transfer the batter into the egg whites. Gently fold in egg whites into the batter. Make sure thoroughly mix WITHOUT breaking the air bubbles.
Pour the batter into the ungreased 17 cm (7”) chiffon cake pan in the same location to prevent more bubbles from forming.
To remove or prevent air pockets, run a skewer through the batter and then drop the pan gently on a counter holding the center tube and wall of cake pan together (so air won’t go into the bottom of the batter).
Bake at 340ºF (170ºC) for 30-35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean and the top of the cake springs back when gently pressed. If the top gets burn too quickly (maybe the heat source is too close), cover the top loosely with aluminum foil.
As soon as you take out the cake pan from the oven, drop it on the counter to shock the cake so it stops shrinking. The cake must be cooled upside down in its pan so that it stretches downward instead of collapsing. Stick the cake pan on a tall heavy bottle. If you use an angel food cake pan, invert the cake pan on a cooling rack.
To remove the cake pan, run a thin sharp knife or thin offset spatula around both the inner and outer edges of the cake.
Remove the cake from the pan and run the knife on the bottom. Move onto a serving plate or cake stand. Dust confectioners’ sugar/powder sugar on top, if you like. Enjoy!",en-US,{},4.48,,Just One Cookbook,60,1 serving(s)

Place the pan over high heat and leave it undisturbed. The liquid starts to boil slowly for the first minute or two, and then it will boil rapidly after that. DO NOT TOUCH the pan until the sugar syrup starts to caramelize from the edge of the pan like below.
When you see dark color syrup around the edge of the pan (above right), gently swirl the pan in a circular motion so the sugar caramelizes evenly. Keep swirling gently until the caramel is a medium golden brown (sorry I was busy making sure the caramel won’t be too dark and couldn’t take the picture).
When it’s medium golden brown, turn down the heat to the lowest and whisk in the 6 Tbsp. butter. Quickly mix well and be careful for splutter.
Carefully add the pineapple and stir until it is coated with the caramel. Here at this moment, I panicked. Caramel started to harden and I couldn’t “stir”! I thought I ruined the whole thing… But don't panic - the caramel will become liquid again once you heat it up and the pineapple will also release juice (see next step).
Turn up the heat to medium-high and bring to a boil. By this time you see caramel is re-liquefying already. Then turn down the heat to medium-low and simmer for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the pineapple turns golden brown.
Using a fork, transfer the pineapple to a plate.
Continue to boil the remaining caramel on medium-high heat for few minutes, or until thick and syrupy.
Arrange the pineapple in concentric circles in the prepared pan. Make sure to fill in any gaps at bottom of the pan with smaller pieces. My pineapple was just large enough to cover the bottom (so don’t eat your pineapple until you finish this step!). If you have extra pineapple, you can do double layers. Then pour the caramel syrup on top.
In a medium bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt.
In a large bowl, beat together the eggs and egg yolks until blended, then slowly beat in the remaining 1 cup (200 grams) sugar, the vanilla, and the 1/2 cup melted butter. Using a rubber spatula, fold the flour mixture into the egg mixture until it's completely mixed.
Pour the batter evenly over the pineapple in the cake pan. Tap the pan gently on a counter top to get rid of any air bubbles in the batter.
Bake for 50 to 60 minutes, or until the top is golden brown. If it becomes golden brown too quickly and not done baking yet, cover with aluminum foil so it doesn't burn. The cake is ready when you insert a skewer in the center of the cake and it comes out clean (batter free). Let cool in the pan on a wire rack for about 30 minutes.
Place a serving plate upside down on top of the cake pan, then holding the pan and the plate tightly together, invert them quickly (but carefully). Lift off the cake pan. If some of the pineapple are stuck to the pan, remove them and place them back on top of the cake. Let the cake cool for at least another 30 minutes, then serve warm or at room temperature.
The cake can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days.",en-US,{},-1.0,,Just One Cookbook,150,1 serving(s)

You will need two madeleine pans.
Melt the unsalted butter in a small saucepan over medium low heat. Be careful not to burn the butter. Once melted completely, transfer to a small bowl and let it cool.
In a large bowl, add ⅔ cup (133 g) sugar. Then sift 1 cup (120 g) all-purpose flour, ¼ tsp salt, 1 tsp baking powder, and 1 Tbsp (6 g) matcha (green tea powder).
Whisk all together to combine.
In a medium bowl, whisk together 2 eggs and 1 Tbsp milk till frothy.
Add the egg mixture into the flour mixture. Using a rubber spatula, stir until just combined.
Slowly add half of the cooled melted butter. Make sure to blend the butter and mixture well before you add more butter. Mix until just blended and do not over mix.
Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate to rest the batter for 3 hours, or if you have the time, overnight (highly recommended). If you don't bake it soon, put the batter in an airtight bag and store it in the freezer for up to 2 weeks.
Center a rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). For a convection oven, reduce cooking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC).
Melt the 1 Tbsp butter in the microwave. Using a pastry brush, brush butter in the molds of two 12 full-size shell-shaped madeleine pans. Then using a fine-mesh strainer, lightly dust 1 Tbsp flour over the molds.
Remove the batter from the refrigerator and fill each mold in the madeleine pan with 1 Tbsp. of the batter. I scoop the batter with a 1-tablespoon measuring spoon and transfer the batter into each mold with a mini rubber spatula. No need to smooth out the batter in the mold as it’ll melt in the oven.
Bake at 375°F (190°C) for 11-13 minutes, or until the madeleines’ edges looks done and the tops spring back when touched.
Remove the pan from the oven and let cool for 3 minutes. Using a fork, gently release the madeleines from the molds and transfer them onto a cooling rack.
To Serve
The madeleines are ready to serve when they are slightly warm or at room temperature. Dust the tops with confectioner’s sugar if desired. If you are storing/freezing the madeleines, do not dust with sugar until you are ready to serve.
To Store
Madeleines get dry rather fast and are best eaten within a few hours after they came out of the oven. To store them longer, let the madeleines cool COMPLETELY. Then you can freeze them (they'll keep for 2 months) or place them in a Ziplock bag (and enjoy within 48 hours). Defrost the madeleines at room temperature first before dusting with confectioner’s sugar. The nice crunch they have right after being baked will slowly fade away and the madeleines will become soft.",en-US,{},4.52,,Just One Cookbook,223,24 serving(s)

Make simple syrup first. In a small saucepan, combine the sugar and water over medium heat. Whisk the mixture until all the sugar is completely dissolved. Remove from the heat and allow to cool.
Clean the yuzu thoroughly. For 2 yuzu, zest the entire yuzu fruits into a small bowl using a microplane or grater. Be sure to zest only the thin outer peel or colored portion (do not zest bitter white part). Then cut the fruits crosswise in half for juicing (Step 4).
For the other 4 yuzu, cut off the top ¼ of the yuzu to make a cup and lid.
Squeeze juice out of all the yuzu (4 yuzu cups from Step 3 and 2 yuzu from Step 2). Strain the juice into the small bowl, making sure to separate the seeds. You should have about ¼ cup of juice and zest.
Hollow out 4 yuzu cup with a spoon. Be careful not to tear the yuzu cups when you are removing the seeds and flesh.
Add the yuzu zest and yuzu juice into the simple syrup and combine well. Transfer the mixture into a bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let the mixture cool in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. I put the saucepan in the refrigerator directly, but it takes more time to cool as the saucepan is still a bit warm.
With Ice Cream Maker:
Transfer the mixture to an ice cream maker and churn for 20-25 minutes until frozen.
Transfer to a shallow container and smooth out the surface. Stuff the yuzu sorbet in the 4 yuzu cups and put the lid on. Place the yuzu cups tightly in a container so they won’t fall.

To Make Shiratama Dango
For shiratama dango, put ¼ cup (34 g) shiratamako and ¼ tsp sugar in a bowl and stir in 2 Tbps warm water a little bit a time until the dough is combined and smooth. Take the dough out of the bowl and roll into a ball. The texture of the dough is like squeezing an ""ear lobe"" (that’s how we describe this particular tenderness in Japanese).
Divide the dough into 6 pieces.
Roll each piece into a ball and then press the center to flatten. With the center flattened, it helps shiratama dango cook faster. Continue with the rest of pieces.
Cook the shiratama dango in boiling water. When shiratama dango is cooked through, about 1-2 minutes, they’ll starts to float. Pick them up and soak in ice water to cool.
Alternatively, if you want to save time, instead of making shiratama dango, you can use kiri mochi (pre-cut rice cake). Cut into 4 small pieces and toast in the toaster oven until puffed up.
To Make Matcha Zenzai
Put 1- 1½ Tbsp sugar in a medium bowl and sift 1 Tbsp (6 g) matcha powder in a fine sieve to remove any lumps.

Cut the vanilla bean in half (we only use ½). Make a slit lengthwise on the vanilla bean and scrape off the vanilla bean with a knife.
In a medium saucepan (preferably a heavy saucepan for equal heat distribution), combine the milk and vanilla bean and bring it to ALMOST boil (small bubbles around the edges). Remove from the heat and set aside.
In a medium mixing bowl, add egg yolks and beat gently. Add granulated sugar and whisk until the mixture turns pale yellow.
Add the cake flour and whisk until combine.
Pour small amount of the hot milk mixture to the egg mixture and quickly whisk to combine. Slowly add the rest of milk while whisking.
Set a fine-mesh strainer over the saucepan and pour everything back into the saucepan. Cook the mixture over medium heat while CONSTANTLY mixing with a silicone spatula. It starts as a thin and frothy mixture and it will start to thicken. It’ll take 20-25 minutes for the custard cream to thicken.
Stir constantly, making sure to scrape off the custard on the entire bottom and the corners of the pan. Ensure that the mixture heats evenly. Lift the spatula up occasionally to check if any large bubbles are bursting at the top of the mixture. Keep cooking and stirring until large bubbles appear. Then boil and stir for 1 minute. The custard should be shiny and drops intermittently when you lift up the silicone spatula. Add the butter to combine, if you are using it. Remove the saucepan from the heat.
Transfer the custard to a tray (or flat container) and cover with plastic wrap to prevent a film from forming on top of the custard. Put the tray over ice cubes and put the ice pack on top of the custard to cool immediately, about 30 minutes. The key is to cool quickly so the custard won’t get spoiled.
When it’s cool, put the custard back into a bowl and whisk until nice and smooth. The custard is now ready to use.

For a convection oven, reduce cooking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC). You will also need an 8” (20 cm) chiffon cake pan. If you have a different size pan, please read this post to adjust the ingredients.
In a bowl, combine cake flour (80 g, ⅔ cup), baking powder (5 g, 1 ¼ tsp), and Dutch-processed cocoa powder (40 g, ½ cup) and mix well with a fork/whisk.
Separate 5 large eggs to yolks and whites. Keep the egg whites in a stand mixer bowl and egg yolks in a large mixing bowl.
Refrigerate (or freeze) the bowl with egg whites for 15 minutes so both bowls and egg whites are cold (it’s okay if the egg whites are partially frozen). In Japan, we chill the egg whites to make smooth, fine-textured meringue and do not use cream of tartar.
Beat the egg yolks.
Add granulated sugar (65 g, ⅓ cup). Whisk vigorously until it’s a creamy pale yellow color.
Add the oil (60 ml, ¼ cup) and beat to combine with the whisk.
Add the milk (90 ml, ⅓ cup +1 ½ Tbsp) and vanilla (5 ml, 1 tsp) and combine well.
Using a fine-mesh sieve, sift half of the dry ingredients. Whisk well to combine.
Add the rest of the dry ingredients and mix well until just combined and no lumps (do not overmix).
Take out the bowl of egg whites and set your stand mixer with a whisk attachment.
Start whipping the egg whites on medium speed (level 5) until the egg whites are bubbly, opaque, and foamy.
Gradually add granulated sugar (65 g, ⅓ cup) in small increments while whisking. Once you add all the sugar, change to a higher speed (level 8) and beat vigorously until stiff peaks form.
To check on stiff peaks, pull up your whisk and see if the egg whites go straight up and just the tip is soft enough that it folds over, like taking a bow. This is a stiff peak stage. By this time, the meringue should have a glossy texture. TIP: I usually pause beating when the egg whites are getting close to the stiff peak stage. Take out the whisk attachment from the mixer and hand-mix the egg whites till homogenous in texture. Typically, the egg whites near the edge of the bowl are looser (not close to stiff peaks) compared to the center of the bowl. Then put the whisk back and continue beating till stiff peaks.
Using a whisk, take ¼ of the meringue from the bowl and add to the batter. Whisk well to combine until homogenous.
Take a third (⅓) of the meringue left in the bowl and this time, gently fold in without deflating the air bubbles in the meringue and batter.
Take another third and repeat the process.
Take the final third and gently fold in. Make sure to thoroughly mix without deflating the air bubbles.
The consistency should look like this when you lift the whisk. Switch to the spatula and fold in one last time, scraping from the side and bottom of the bowl, making sure there is no chocolate accumulation.
From 6-8 inch high, pour the batter into the ungreased 20-cm (8-inch) chiffon cake pan at the same location to prevent more bubbles from forming. Gently tap the cake pan on the working surface to release the air pockets in the batter.
Run a wooden skewer through the batter to release air pockets. Put the cake pan in the middle rack of the oven and bake at 340ºF (170ºC) for 35-40 minutes (40 minutes for my oven).
When it’s done baking, insert the wooden skewer in the middle of the cake to see if it comes out clean (If wet, bake longer) and the top of the cake springs back when gently pressed. If the top gets burn too quickly (maybe heat source is too close), cover the top loosely with aluminum foil.
Remove the cake pan from the oven and gently drop the pan onto the working surface to shock the cake so it stops shrinking.
Prepare a bottle with a long neck and invert the cake pan to let cool completely in its cake pan so that it stretches downward.
Once the cake is completely cool, run offset spatulas around both inner and outer edges of the cake (I use a large/long spatula for outside and bottom and a small spatula for around the inner tube). I used to use a knife, but the tip of the knife tends to poke the cake while moving around, so I stopped using it.
Gently remove the cake from the pan and run the offset spatula on the bottom of the cake.
Invert the cake onto a plate or cake stand. Chiffon cake is served “upside-down”, the flat bottom side being on top.
To Serve and Store
Dust with powdered sugar and decorate with raspberries and mint leaves if you like. I strongly recommend consuming the cake soon, however, you can keep the cake at room temperature (cooler place) in a cake stand with a cover for 1-2 days.

To Make the Custard
In a large bowl, whisk together 10 eggs and ⅓ cup sugar. Tip: Make sure to beat the eggs well and let the sugar dissolve at this point; it gets harder to mix when more liquid is added.
Add 1 ½ cup heavy cream, ½ cup milk, 2 tsp vanilla extract, and ½ tsp almond extract.
Add 1 tsp cinnamon, ½ tsp ground clove, and ¼ tsp kosher salt.
Lastly, add 1 tsp orange zest and whisk all together. Set aside.
To Prepare the Bread Pudding
Cut the Panettone into 1 inch (2.5 cm) slices.
Cut the slices into 1 inch (2.5 cm) cubes.
Grease a 9 x 13 casserole dish with butter and place cubed bread in the casserole.
Pour the mixture evenly over the Panettone. If the top of the bread pudding is not covered with the custard, you can gently press down or flip some piece to coat with the custard. Cover it with plastic and refrigerator for 4-6 hours or overnight (preferably).
To Bake the Bread Pudding
Preheat the oven to 350ºF (180ºC) and transfer the casserole dish from the refrigerator to the preheated oven. Bake for 45-50 minutes, rotating halfway, until the bread pudding has set in the center, puffed up, and is golden brown.

Cut parchment paper to fit the baking pans (See the video for this process).
Preheat oven to 320ºF (160ºC). For a convection oven, reduce cooking time by 25ºF (15ºC).
Sift the bread flour with the sifter or a fine-meshed strainer twice. Holding the handle with one hand and tapping the strainer gently with the other, the flour will gradually sift through the strainer.
Add 2 ½ Tbsp warm water to honey and whisk well.
Fit the mixer with the whisk attachment. Crack eggs into the bowl and vigorously whisk until combined.
Add the sugar.
Beat the eggs and sugar on high speed (Speed 10) for 5 minutes (See Notes). The volume of the beaten eggs will increase about 4 times. The texture will be thick and the color will be pale yellow. When you stop the mixer and lift the whisk attachment, the mixture should fall in ribbons.
Add the honey mixture into the egg mixture and whisk on low speed (Speed 2) until combined, about 30 seconds.
Add the bread flour at three separate times: add ⅓ of the bread flour and whisk on low speed (Speed 2) for 15 seconds, then add more flour and whisk for 15 seconds. Add the last remaining portion and whisk until just combined for about 1 minute. Do not overmix.
Spray the loaf pans with oil and spread out evenly with pastry brush.
Put the parchment paper in the pans and make sure the paper sticks to the pans. If not, add oil and spread out evenly with a brush.
Pour the batter into the pans (about 80% full).
Using a skewer, draw a zigzag line to remove the air bubbles in the batter.
Level batter in each pan by holding pan 2-inches above counter dropping it flat onto counter. Do this several times to release air bubbles.
Bake at 320ºF (160ºC) in the middle rack of the oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or until golden brown and a skewer inserted in the center comes out clean (See Notes). I bake for 35 minutes and keep my oven door ajar for a few minutes then I take out the cake. When done, cake sides will pull away from the pan slightly; the top will be flat and feel spongy when pressed with a finger.
Mix 1 Tbsp honey and ½ Tbsp warm water in a bowl and apply the honey mixture on top of the cake with a pastry brush.
Place a sheet of plastic wrap on the counter top. Take out the cake from the pan to the plastic wrap, top facing down. Gently peel off parchment paper.
Immediately wrap the cake with plastic wrap to keep the moisture and while it's hot store in the refrigerator overnight (at least 12 hours), keeping the top side facing down. This will help the cake have more fine and moist texture.
To serve, slice off the sides of the cake with a sharp bread knife and cut into ¾ to 1 inch thick slices (you get 7-8 slices total). It's better if you bring the cake to room temperature before serving.

Line a baking sheet/pan with parchment paper. Place Nutella in a plastic bag (I used a Ziploc bag) toward one corner of the bag (or use this method* - See Note). Twist so that it does not squeeze out of the top. Cut one corner off the end of the bag.
Pipe small dollops of Nutella onto the parchment paper, about 1-1 ½ tsp. each. You will need about 2 dozen and make some extra just in case. Transfer the baking sheet to the freezer and let sit until firm, about 2 hours.
Cut the butter into a few pieces and place in a large skillet or a saucepan over medium heat. Melt the butter completely stirring frequently with the spatula. As the butter heats, it will begin to foam and then bubble. After several minutes, the milk solids will start to become brown on the bottom of the pan (sorry no pics after this - I was a bit pre-occupied). Make sure that milk solids do not stick to the pan. Continue stirring until the butter is evenly browned, being careful not to burn. Remove from the heat and let cool for a few minutes (see the video in the post).
In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda and salt.
In the bowl of an electric mixer, combine the sugars and the brown butter. Mix on medium speed until well blended and smooth.
Blend in the egg and egg yolk, vanilla and Greek yogurt, scraping down the bowl as needed.
With the mixer on low speed, blend in the dry ingredients just until incorporated.
Fold in the chocolate chips. Chill the dough briefly, about 30 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 350F (175C) and line baking sheets with parchment paper. We will work in 2-3 batches as the Nutella dollops soften quickly when they are outside of the freezer.
Use a tablespoon, scoop a portion of cookie dough twice and roll into a ball. Place the cookie dough rolls on the prepared baking sheets, 2-3 inches apart. Put the remaining cookie dough in the refrigerator.
Take out the frozen Nutella dollops from freezer. Press an indentation into the center of the dough ball to create a bowl shape. Place a dollop of the frozen Nutella in the indentation and pinch together the edges of the cookie dough over the top to completely seal it in the center.
Make a couple of pinches on the top part of the dough so that the finished product will look more appealing. Place the cookies on the prepared baking sheets, 2-3 inches apart. By this time Nutella dollops are too soft to pick up with your hand so put them back in freezer.
Bake until the cookies are golden brown about 14 minutes, rotating the baking sheet halfway through. After you rotate the baking sheet, start working on the next batch with remaining dough as needed.
When the cookies are finished baking, sprinkle lightly with additional sea salt. Let sit a few minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool. Once they are completely cool, store them in an airtight container.
You can rewarm the cookie(s) in microwave for a few seconds before you eat.
If you don’t want to bake the whole cookie dough, shape the dough balls and flash freeze on a baking sheet. Then put in a freezer bag and store in freezer up to 3 months.

Cut the pastry sheets in half with a scissor. Now you have 4 rectangular sheets. Then make several slits on 2 sheets that will go on top of the pie.
Peel the sweet potato and cut it in half lengthwise. Then cut into smaller chunks so they will cook faster.

Loosen the mochi with spatula. Soak the wooden pestle (or anything that you can pound with) in water and start pounding.
Mochi will get sticker and shinier by pounding. Make sure to soak the pestle in water between poundings. It will help mochi become shiny and glossy.
Once mochi is cool enough for you to handle, transfer the mochi on moist working surface. Start kneading with your wet hands until glossy, elastic, and smooth.

If your finger has red bean paste on it or if the red bean paste overfills out of the seam line, the sides won’t stick each other and it’ll become very hard to seal. What I do is pull mochi away from red bean paste and seal tightly first, then reshape the mochi to make them look nice.

Gather all the ingredients first.
Cut the unsalted butter into smaller pieces (so that they will soften faster). It’s important to soften (not melt) the butter before we start.
In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or in a large bowl with a hand mixer, beat the butter until smooth and creamy.
Add the powder sugar and blend until soft and light. Scrape down the bowl as needed.
Sift the cake flour and almond meal into the bowl.
Add zest from 3 Meyer lemons. Make sure you just zest the yellow skin, not pith (white bitter part).
Add the milk and mix all together with the silicone spatula.
At the beginning, the dough is crumbly, but it will come together into a ball.
Because the dough will be still too soft to roll into a log shape, take out the dough from the bowl and wrap with plastic wrap. Keep in the refrigerator for 1 hour.
Take out the dough from the refrigerator and unwrap. Shape the dough into a cylinder, about 1.5 inches (4 cm) diameter.
Wrap in plastic wrap and chill in refrigerator until firm, at least 2 hours. Optional: you can place the dough on a bed of rice while chilling. It helps the dough in nice cylindrical shape, so your cookie slices won’t be flat on one side.
To Bake Cookies
Preheat the oven to 375ºF (190ºC). For a convection oven, reduce cooking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC). Line the baking sheet with parchment paper or silicone baking liner.
Take out the cookie log (dough) from the refrigerator and remove the plastic wrap. In a tray that fits the cookie dough, sprinkle the white sparkling sugar. Roll the cookie log on the sparkling sugar until the log is covered with sugar.
The sugar should stick without any issue, but you could wrap the dough with a damp paper towel so that the dough will be slightly wet or brush egg wash on the dough (traditional method).
With a sharp knife, slice the dough into 1/3 inches (7 mm)-thick rounds. Place them on the baking sheet, leaving about 1” (2.5 cm) between rounds.
Lower the oven temperature to 350ºF (180ºC) and bake the cookies for about 25 minutes, or until the edge of the cookies start to get golden brown.
Remove from the oven and let cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes; then carefully transfer to a cooling rack and let cool completely.

After Chilling 4-5 Hours...
Remove the chocolate from the baking dish.
Cut the excess chocolate around the edges to have nice sharp corners.
Warm up the sharp knife with a hot towel, and cut the chocolate into 1” strips. Make sure to clean/warm the knife before each cut to achieve a nice sharp cut.
Depending on your baking dish, the 4 sides of the chocolate may not look good (mine has curved edges and corners). If that's the case, save these chocolate pieces for yourself to enjoy.
Then cut the strips into cubes. Remember to clean/warm up the knife before each cut.
Sprinkle the cocoa powder on the top. Optionally, if you prefer all sides to have cocoa powder, you can dip in cocoa powder to coat all sides.
To Serve
Serve Nama Chocolate on a plate, or put it in a box as a gift. If the chocolate just came out of the refrigerator, I recommend waiting for 5-10 minutes before serving so it's soft enough to melt in the mouth instead of chilled and hard chocolate.
To Store
Keep in the airtight container and store in the refrigerator for up to 4 days. Or you can freeze the chocolate for up to a month.",en-US,{},4.69,,Just One Cookbook,270,36 serving(s)
Cherry Blossom Cookies,Namiko Chen,https://www.justonecookbook.com/cherry-blossom-cookies/,Japanese,https://www.justonecookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/cherry-blossom-cookies-I.jpg,"['½ cup unsalted butter ((4 oz, 1 stick, 8 Tbsp; room temperature))', '1 oz salt pickled cherry blossoms ((1 pack))', '1 cup cake flour', '⅛ tsp kosher/sea salt (I use Diamond Crystal; Use half for table salt)', '½ cup confectioners’ sugar/powdered sugar', '1 large egg yolk ((0.5 oz, 15 g))', 'white sparkling sugar']","Gather all the ingredients.
Cut the unsalted butter into smaller pieces (so that they will soften faster). It’s important to soften the butter before we start.
Separate salt pickled cherry blossoms into 2 groups: good flowers for decoration on the cookies, and 1 Tbsp of damaged flowers for blending in the cookie dough.
To remove saltiness, soak each group of flowers in water (separately) for at least 30 minutes.
Squeeze water out from 1 Tbsp of damaged flowers and pat dry with a paper towel.
Then mince the flowers and set aside.
Pick up the good flowers from the water, shape the petals nicely, and place the each flower on paper towel. Cover with another sheet of paper towel and gently pat dry. Set aside.
Sift the cake flour and add the salt in the same bowl.
In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or in a large bowl with a hand mixer, beat the butter until smooth and creamy.
Add the ½ cup (60 g) powdered sugar and blend until soft and light. Scrape down the bowl as needed.
Add the egg yolk and mix well until combined.
Gradually add 1 cup cake flour (120 g) and blend until the dough is smooth.
Add minced cherry blossoms and blend well.
Because the dough will be still too soft to roll into a log shape, cover the bowl with plastic wrap (or take out the dough from the bowl and wrap with plastic wrap) and keep in the fridge for 1 hour.
Shape the dough into a cylinder, about 1.5 inches (4 cm) diameter.
Wrap in plastic wrap and chill in refrigerator until firm, at least 2 hours. Optional; you can place the dough on a bed of rice while chilling. It’ll help keep the dough in nice cylindrical shape, so your cookie slices won’t be flat on one side.
Preheat the oven to 350ºF (175ºC). For a convection oven, reduce cooking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC). Line the baking sheet with parchment paper or silicone baking liner.
Remove the plastic wrap, and then wrap around the dough with a damp paper towel so that the dough will be slightly wet. Or of course, you can use traditional method and brush egg wash on the dough (but damp paper towel method works every time for me).
In a tray that fits the cookie dough, sprinkle the white sparkling sugar. Remove the damp paper towel and roll the cookie log on the sparkling sugar.
With a sharp knife, slice the dough into ⅓ inches (7 mm)-thick rounds. Place them on the baking sheet, leaving about 1” (2.5 cm) between rounds.
Gently press down the reserved cherry blossom and decorate on the cookie rounds. Tip: If the cookies are left out too long, place in the refrigerator for 10-15 minutes until the cookies are chilled (or the freezer for a short time); otherwise, the butter melts too quickly in the oven and the cookies will be flat.
Bake the cookies at 350ºF (170ºC) for about 15 minutes, or until the edge of the cookies start to get golden brown.
Remove from the oven and let cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes; then carefully transfer to a cooling rack and let cool completely.
To Store
You can keep the cookies in an airtight container and store at a cool place for at least 4 days. You can also freeze the unbaked logs of dough, wrapped in plastic wrap, for up to 2 months. Let sit at room temperature for about 10 minutes before cutting and baking. Do not let the dough fully defrost.",en-US,{},4.48,,Just One Cookbook,225,16 serving(s)

You will need a medium saucepan, a heatproof mixing bowl (to set over the saucepan), and 2 large bowls. Make sure one of the large bowls can fit the mixing bowl and fill it with ice water, and set aside for Step 6.
In the saucepan, fill with 2 inches of water. Set the mixing bowl over and make sure the bottom of the bowl does not touch the water. Remove the bowl (will use it shortly for egg custard), and bring the water to barely a simmer, and reduce the heat to low.
To make the custard:
In the heatproof mixing bowl, add egg yolks, marsala wine, and 3 Tbsp granulated sugar and start whisking with a handheld electric mixer.
Set the bowl over the saucepan of barely simmering water and continue to beat the eggs. Keep your instant thermometer handy as you will be checking the temperature of the egg mixture. To consume Tiramisu safely, heat the egg yolk mixture until it reaches 160ºF (71ºC), about 10 minutes. 160ºF is close enough to turn the eggs into scrambled eggs; therefore, I highly recommend both an electric mixer and an instant-read thermometer for this process (please read my post).
Cook, beating constantly, until the custard is light and thick.
Continue whisking (I use level 3 of 5-speed hand mixer throughout the time).
Once the custard reaches 160ºF (71ºC), immediately remove the bowl from the saucepan and set in a large bowl of ice water. Let it cool down for 1 minute to quickly stop cooking.
Put the mascarpone in another large bowl and soften it with a silicone spatula. Gradually fold the custard into the mascarpone.
Take note: the egg yolk mixture does get cooked a bit on the side of the bowl from the double boiler. Do not scrape off to use it.
Gently fold in until just smooth (the custard will be grainy if over mixed).
In a large bowl (you can reuse the bowl from ice bath, but make sure it's completely dry), beat heavy (whipping) cream until foamy, and gradually add sugar.
Beat until medium peak forms.
Gradually fold in the heavy cream mixture into the mascarpone mixture.
Fold in the mixture until well combined.
To assemble:
Combine the hot water (175ºF/80ºC) and matcha powder and whisk until there is no lumps. Transfer to a flat-bottom container that fits ladyfingers.
One at a time, quickly dip both sides of the ladyfingers in the matcha mixture until soaked but not soggy. Place them on the bottom of an 8""x8"" (20x20 cm) baking dish, arranging 2 rows of 6 ladyfingers each.
Spread half of the mascarpone custard over the ladyfingers. Smooth out the surface.
Dip the remaining ladyfingers in the matcha mixture and place them on top of the custard.
Top with the remaining custard, smooth out the top, and cover with a sheet of plastic wrap to cover the cream. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours, preferably overnight.
Before serving, dust with matcha powder and enjoy!

Japanese Cheesecake,Namiko Chen,https://www.justonecookbook.com/souffle-japanese-cheesecake/,Japanese,https://www.justonecookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Japanese-Cheesecake-4631-I.jpg,"['1 Tbsp unsalted butter ((for greasing the pan & parchment paper))', '6 large eggs (50 g each w/o shell) ((10.6 oz, 300 g without shell))', '10.6 oz cream cheese', '4 Tbsp unsalted butter', '¾ cup heavy (whipping) cream ((¾ cup + 4 tsp to be precise))', '4 ½ Tbsp sugar', '⅔ cup cake flour', '½ lemon ((for zest))', '2 Tbsp lemon juice ((about ½ large lemon))', '½ cup sugar ((8 Tbsp; for beating egg whites))', '2 Tbsp apricot jam ((for glaze))', '2 tsp hot water ((for glaze))']","Before You Start
I shared more detailed info in the post, so please visit the blog post of this recipe.
Prepare Cake Pan
Cut parchment paper for the bottom and side of cake pan. You will need a 9” (23 cm) round paper for the bottom, one 4” x 30” (10 x 76 cm) paper for the side of cake pan, and two 2” x 30” (5 x 76 cm) paper strips which will be used for “transporting”.
Grease the cake pan and parchment paper (for bottom and sides) with butter (15 g). You don't need to use all of it.
Place the 2 “straps” criss-cross on the bottom of the cake pan. Then place the bottom and side parchment paper. The grease side of the 9” (23 cm) paper should face up, and face in on the 4” x 30” (10 x 76 cm) paper.
Preheat the Oven & Gather Ingredients
Preheat the oven to 350ºF (180ºC). You will be baking at 320ºF (160ºC) but when you open the oven to place the cheesecake you’ll lose some heat, so we’ll start off a bit higher.
Please note that it is very important that ingredients are all measured before starting. Separate the 6 eggs into egg yolks and egg whites. Refrigerate the egg whites.
Mix over Double Boiler
Set a medium saucepan filled with 2” (5 cm) water and bring to simmer. Add cream cheese (300 g), unsalted butter (60 g), heavy whipping cream (200 ml), and granulated sugar (60 g) in a large bowl. Put the bowl over the saucepan.
Using a silicone spatula, mash the cream cheese and butter. Once they are melted, use whisk to blend everything together. Remove from the heat.
Mix at the Counter
In the warm cream cheese mixture add 6 egg yolks, one yolk at a time while whisking. Make sure each egg yolk blended well with the mixing before adding the next one.
Using a fine-mesh strainer, sift cake flour (80 g) into the batter. Whisk and blend together.
Then pass the batter through the same fine mesh strainer to a clean large bowl, creating the silky texture for the batter.
Zest half of a lemon into the batter. Make sure you only zest the yellow part, not the bitter white part. Then squeeze half lemon into a small bowl. Measure lemon juice (30 ml) and add to the batter. Whisk well to blend and set aside.
Set Up Bain-Marie
Put the baking sheet inside the oven and pour hot water until half way or 1 inch deep. Close the oven.
Beat Egg Whites
Add cold egg whites into a large clean mixing bowl (of the stand mixer). Make sure there is no oil or water in the bowl. If you have space in your refrigerator, I highly recommend keeping the mixing bowl cold until you’re ready to use it. Start whisking on medium speed (speed 4) until the egg whites become opaque, foamy, and bubbly, about 2 minutes. Then slowly add 100 g granulated sugar, ⅓ portion at a time while the mixer runs.
Once all the sugar has been added, increase the mixer speed to high (speed 8-9) and beat the egg whites until “soft” to “medium” peaks. When lift the whisk, the egg whites shouldn’t fold ribbons (drizzle) anymore. When you turn your whisk upside down, the egg whites should cling to the whisk and hold their shape for a few seconds, but then start to flop over.
Fold in Egg Whites
Using a whisk, mix in ⅓ of egg whites into the cream cheese mixture until incorporated. Then gently fold in another ⅓ into the mixture.
Lastly, pour the mixture back into the mixer bowl (with ⅓ of egg whites still in it) and fold in very gently.
Pour the mixture into the baking pan in all at once, avoiding air pockets while pouring. Tap the cake pan a few times on the kitchen counter to release any air pockets in the batter.
Bake the Cheesecake
Place the cake pan into the baking sheet that’s already in the oven. Reduce the oven temperature to 320ºF (160ºC) and start baking for 70-75 minutes. Then, reduce the oven temperature to 300ºF (150ºC) and bake for another 10 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the skewer inserted comes out clean. For a convection oven, reduce cooking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC).
Let Cool
Turn off the oven and leave the oven door ajar for 15-20 minutes with the cake inside. If you take the cake out immediately, the sudden change of temperature could cause the cake to shrink or collapse. You want the cake to slowly shrink down to half the height, roughly from 4 inches to 2 inches. Remove the pan from the oven. Gently pull out the cake using the 2 parchment paper straps (with another set of hand).
Remove the parchment paper around the cake (leave the bottom one). Combine apricot jam (2 Tbsp) and hot water (2 tsp) in a small bowl. Brush the apricot mixture over the top of the cheesecake. Let cool to room temperature.
To Serve
You can serve the cake at room temperature (fluffiest!) or chill the cake for 1-2 hours before serving.
To Store
You can store the cake in the refrigerator for up to 3-4 days or in the freezer for 3-4 weeks. Defrost the cake overnight in the refrigerator. The cold cheesecake is dense, so leave it at the counter till chilled/room temperature before serving.",en-US,{},4.68,,Just One Cookbook,170,1 serving(s)

In a small saucepan, heat soy milk over medium heat until warm to the touch. Keep a close eye on the pot and DO NOT BOIL. Turn off the heat.
In a bowl with matcha green tea powder, add a little bit of soy milk. Now using a whisk or chasen (bamboo whisk), combine the soy milk and matcha together. Tip 1: Matcha dissolves easier when liquid is warm. Tip 2: Gradually add in the soy milk. DO NOT pour too much soy milk at once. Superfine matcha powder can easily turn into lumps and it will be harder to combine.
Add more soy milk as you needed, until the mixture becomes a smooth paste and there are no more lumps of matcha.
Add the matcha paste back into the soy milk in the pot. Whisk it well to combine.
In a new pot, add water and powdered kanten (agar agar).
Whisk together and bring it to a boil on medium-high heat. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook for 2 minutes until the powder is completely dissolved.
Add the sugar and whisk to combine with the mixture.
Then add the matcha soymilk into the pot. Give it another whisk until well combined, and turn off the heat.
Prepare the glass ramekins or containers on a tray. Place the strainer over the ramekin and strain the matcha soy milk mixture. Divide the mixture evenly.
Using a spoon, collect the small bubbles into one corner of the ramekins and scoop it all up. Chill in the fridge for at least 2 hours to set.

Joshinko and Shiratamako on the left and Dangoko on the right. Whichever you decide to use, the instructions below are the same.
Gather ingredients for the sweet soy glaze. Soak the skewers in water. You can start boiling a large pot of water on low heat (See Step 8)
To Make Dango (Rice Dumplings)
Combine Shiratamako and Joshinko in a bowl (or add just Dangoko in a bowl).
Stir in warm water (or cold water for Dangoko) a little bit at a time while mixing with chopsticks. Please note: it is possible that you may need less or more water depending on where you live. I live in a dry climate, so I may use more water than you.
The flours start to stick together and eventually it becomes clumps. Using your hands, combine into one ball.
Knead until the dough becomes smooth. The texture is like squeezing an ""earlobe"" (that’s how we describe the tenderness for this type of mochi in Japanese).
Make the dough into a ball. Divide the dough into 8 equal pieces.
Then divide each piece into 2 balls. You will have 16 equal-sized balls. I always like to measure mine. Each ball should be 20 grams. You may have some extra dough, but that’s okay.
Shape into a nice smooth round ball. If the dough is cracking or has some wrinkle, tap your finger in water and apply the small amount of water on the cracked area to smooth out. I have 16 equal-sized balls.
Once the water in the pot is boiling, gently drop in each dumpling into the pot with a continuous motion. We want to cook them all at once, but also keeping them in good shapes. Stir the balls occasionally so they don’t stick on the bottom of the pot.
Dumplings will stay on the bottom first but once they are cooked, they will float. Then cook an additional 1-2 minute.
Transfer the dumplings into iced water.
Once the dumplings are cooled, drain well and transfer to a tray (if you wet the tray, the dumplings won’t stick).
Skewer three pieces into a bamboo skewer. Continue the rest of the balls and set aside.
To Make Sweet Soy Glaze
Combine all the ingredients in a saucepan without turning on the heat.
Potato starch/cornstarch will become lumps once you add the heat to it, so mix all together first. Then turn on the heat and continue to whisk.
Keep whisking as the mixture can become thick suddenly.
When the sauce becomes thick, remove the saucepan from the heat and transfer the sauce to a container or bowl. If you are making this sauce ahead of time, remove it from the heat earlier while the consistency is still not too thick because the moisture will evaporate and thicken as it cools.
To Serve
[Optional] If you have a kitchen torch, you can give them a little bit of char for taste. You can also grill over the direct heat (If you are going to place on a wire rack, dumplings tend to stick, so grease it). You can use a broiler to give a char or use a non-stick frying pan to pan fry the surface of dango.
Pour the sweet soy glaze on top and serve immediately.

Combine shiratamako and sugar in a medium bowl and whisk all together.
Add water and mix well until combined.
Microwave Method: If you’re using a microwave to cook mochi, cover the bowl with some plastic wrap (do not cover too tight). Put the bowl in the microwave and heat it on high heat (1100w) for 1 minute. Take it out and stir with wet rubber spatula. Cover again and cook for 1 minute. Stir again, cover, and cook for 30 seconds to finish cooking. The color of mochi should change from white to almost translucent.
Steaming Method: If you’re using a steamer, cover the steamer lid with a towel so the condensation won’t drop into the mochi mixture. Put the bowl into a steamer basket and cover to cook for 15 minutes. Halfway cooking, stir with a wet rubber spatula and cover to finish cooking. The color of mochi should change from white to almost translucent.
Cover the work surface with parchment paper and dust it generously with potato starch. Then transfer the cooked mochi on top.
To prevent from sticking, sprinkle more potato starch on top of the mochi. Once it’s cool down a bit, you can spread the mochi into a thin layer with your hands or with a rolling pin. Make sure to apply potato starch on your hands and the rolling pin. I recommend using a rolling pin because it’s easier to evenly spread out.
Transfer the mochi with parchment paper onto a large baking sheet. Refrigerate for 15 minutes until the mochi is set.
Take out the mochi from the refrigerator and cut out 7-8 circles with the 3.5 inch (9 cm) cookie cutter.
Dust off the excess potato starch with a pastry brush. If you find some sticky part, cover the area with potato starch first then dust off. Place a plastic wrap on a plate and then mochi wrapper on top, then lay another layer of plastic wrapper down. Repeat for all wrappers. With leftover mochi dough, roll into a ball and then flatten into a thin layer again and cut out into more circle wrappers (I could make about 12 mochi wrappers).
Now we’re ready to make daifuku mochi. On the work surface, place one sheet of plastic wrap with a mochi layer on top. Using the cookie scoop, scoop out anko on top of the mochi wrapper.
Pinch the four corners of the mochi layer together to wrap the anko. Then pinch the remaining corners together.

Sweet Tart Crust,Namiko Chen,https://www.justonecookbook.com/tart-crust/,American,https://www.justonecookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Sweet-Tart-Crust-I.jpg,"['1 ¼ cup all-purpose flour (plain flour)', '½ cup confectioner’s sugar', '¼ tsp kosher/sea salt (I use Diamond Crystal; Use half for table salt)', '½ cup unsalted butter ((1 stick, 8 Tbsp; cold))', '1 large egg (50 g w/o shell) ((cold))', '½ tsp pure vanilla extract']","Make the Dough
Gather all the ingredients. If possible, keep all ingredients chilled in the refrigerator until ready to start.
Cut the butter into small cubes. Crack the egg into a small bowl.
Choice #1 - Pastry Cutter:
In a large bowl, stir together the flour, sugar, and salt.
Add the butter to the flour mixture. Using a pastry cutter or 2 knives, cut the butter into flour mixture until the texture resembles coarse cornmeal, with butter pieces no larger than small peas.
Add the egg and vanilla extract and mix with a fork just until the dough pulls together.
Choice #2 - Food Processor:
Process all-purpose flour, sugar, and salt in a food processor for a few seconds until combined.
Add the butter and pulse until mixture resembles coarse meal, about 15 pulses.
Add the egg and vanilla extract and pulse until the dough forms clumps, about 15 seconds.
Form Dough into a Disk
Transfer the dough clumps to a lightly floured surface (I use this pastry mat) and form into a ball. If sticky, lightly sprinkle flour.
Flatten the ball with your hands to form a thick disk. Wrap with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour (or 30 mins in the freezer). The dough must be completely chilled before being used. To store: If you don’t use the dough right away, you can store in the refrigerator for up to 3 days, or freeze it for up to 2 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator, then let sit at room temperature until easily rollable.
Roll Out the Dough
Take the dough out from the refrigerator and let it sit on the counter for a few minutes to soften slightly for easy rolling. Meanwhile lightly butter a 9-inch (23 cm) fluted tart pan with a removable bottom.
Lightly flour your working surface and place the dough on top. Using a rolling pin, roll out the dough into an 11-inch circle, with 1/8-inch (3 mm) thick. If the dough is too soft, put back into the refrigerator.
Flour the rolling pin and roll the dough loosely around it, then unroll it into the tart pan.
Evenly pat the dough onto the bottom and sides of the greased tart pan. Seal any cracks in the dough.
Trim off excess dough with a sharp knife, or with the rolling pin by rolling over the tart pan. A good tip I learned from a Japanese cookbook (optional): Using your index finger, gently press the dough onto the side so the dough will peak out 2 mm from the pan. The dough tends to shrink while baking, so this helps to keep the height of the crust.
With a fork, gently prick the dough several times. Cover the tart pan with plastic wrap and place in the freezer until firm, about 30 minutes. Freezing the dough before baking prevents it from shrinking.
Blind Bake the Crust
To prevent the crust from becoming soggy, I always like to blind bake the crust. Preheat the oven to 375ºF (190ºC) and place the rack in the center. For a convection oven, reduce cooking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC).
When the oven is ready, tightly line the chilled crust with 2 layers of parchment paper, covering the edges to prevent them from burning. Fill the crust with pie weights (or dried beans, uncooked rice, pennies, etc). Make sure they are evenly distributed over the entire surface.
Bake the crust for 20 minutes, until the foil no longer sticks to the dough. Transfer the crust to a wire rack and remove the pie weights and parchment paper.
To partially bake the crust, continue to bake the crust for 5 minutes longer. Proceed with your tart recipe: add the filling and finish baking. Check your recipe to see if the crust should be used while warm or after it’s been left to cool on a wire rack.

Make a ""partially baked"" crust by following this step. You can make the tart crust ahead of time.
To Make the Almond Cream Filling (Frangipane)
Gather all the ingredients. Make sure to take out the butter and eggs from the refrigerator and keep at room temperature. If the eggs are too cold when you add to the mixture, they reduce the temperature of the butter, making emulsion more difficult. Adding the eggs all at once also inhibits emulsion, and results in that scrambled egg appearance. You can soak the cold eggs for 5 minutes in warm (not hot!) water, but it's best to take out both butter and eggs out from the fridge earlier.
In a large bowl, cream the softened unsalted butter.
Add confectioners’ sugar and mix well until the mixture resembles a coarse meal.
Add almond flour, all-purpose flour, and salt, and mix well.
Add eggs one at a time and incorporate into the mixture.
Add vanilla extract, almond extract, and rum.
Whisk until homogenized and smooth. The almond cream can be kept refrigerated for up to 3 to 5 days or frozen for weeks.
For the Assembly
Preheat the oven to 375ºF (190ºC). For a convection oven, reduce cooking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC). Melt the apricot jam and 1 Tbsp water in the microwave for 10 seconds until liquefied. Apply the jam on the base of the cooled pastry case to prevent soggy bottom. Reserve the jam for later. Fill the baked tart crust with almond cream, smoothing out to the edges with an offset spatula, and refrigerate for 30 minutes to set.
Meanwhile, peel the pears, cut each in half lengthwise, and scoop out cores.
Cut each half crosswise into ⅛ inch (3 mm) slices. Squeeze the lemon and rub the pears with lemon juice to prevent browning.
Take out the tart crust from the refrigerator. Gently press each pear half to fan out toward the stem/top side. Slide the knife under pears and transfer to the almond filling.
Arrange the top with points facing in and pears fanning out toward the center. Make sure to space pears out so they are not touching, as the filling will puff up and they need room to expand.
Bake the Tart
Bake the tart at 375ºF (190ºC) until golden brown or the bamboo skewer inserted into the center of filling comes out clean, about 40-45 minutes.
Remove the tart from the oven and let cool in the pan on the wire rack. Brush the pears with the leftover apricot jam. Once it’s cool, carefully unmold the tart.
Toast the almond slices in the frying pan (no oil) until golden, about 5 minutes.
Sprinkle confectioners’ sugar and toasted almond slices on top, if desired, and serve slightly warm. Cut into wedges and enjoy!
Storage
The tart can be stored in the refrigerator up to 3 days. Slightly re-heat the tart before serving.",en-US,{},4.67,,Just One Cookbook,90,1 serving(s)

Rinse the sweet rice and soak it for at least 1 hour to overnight.
Meanwhile, soak the sakura leaves in water for 15 minutes to remove salt. Then dry the leaves with paper towel.
Wet your hands and roll anko into 6 small balls between hands.
Drain well and put the sweet rice in a large bowl.
Add water and red food coloring and mix well (don’t add too much as the color of the mochi will be too pink. I think I added a little too much.).
Cover with plastic wrap and microwave for 6 minutes (1100W). Mix once in between.
Uncover the plastic wrap and mix. Then cover with kitchen towel for 5 minutes.
Add sugar to the sweet rice and mix it all together.
Pound the sweet rice with a pestle until sweet rice is very sticky (keep some rice shape). Divide the rice into 6 portions.
On the prep surface, place a sheet of plastic wrap and spray a bit of water. Place ⅙ of sweet rice and spread it into a rectangular shape. Make sure there is no void in the center area.
Place an anko ball in the center and roll the sweet rice over it to cover anko.
Tighten the plastic wrap and twist to make a nice oval shape.

In a large bowl, using a handheld mixer or a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter for 30 seconds.
Add ½ cup sugar and 2 Tbsp miso.
Beat everything together on medium-high speed until smooth, light, and fluffy, about 2 minutes.
Crack the egg and whisk in a small bowl. Gradually add the egg to the butter mixture while mixing.
Beat on high speed until combined, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl and beat again as needed to combine in between.
In a small bowl, combine 1 ⅔ cup all-purpose flour and 1 tsp baking powder and mix with a fork (I do this extra step so that baking powder is evenly distributed when sifting).
With a fine-mesh sieve, sift the flour mixture over a medium bowl.
Gradually add the flour mixture into the mixing bowl at low speed.
Once you finish adding all the flour mixture, turn up to high speed and beat until incorporated.
Sprinkle a small amount of flour on the working surface and transfer the dough. If the dough is too soft, chill in the refrigerator for 15 minutes. By chilling, the butter/fat will solidify and it'll be easier to work with.
Roll the dough into a ball and cut in half. Note: This recipe can be used for cut out cookies. Form the dough into a disk, wrap and chill then roll out to ¼-½ inch, cut and bake.
Roll the dough into 2 long logs.
Each log should be 10 inches (25 cm) long with 1 inch (2.5 cm) diameter.
Cut the long logs in half; now you have four 5-inch (12.5 cm) logs.
Prepare a small flat container (or baking sheet) and add white sesame seeds (save the black one for later a time). Moist a sheet of paper towel with water and wrap around a log so the dough is moistened.
Roll the moistened log in the sesame seeds and wrap in parchment paper or plastic.
I've learned the best way to keep the dough from flattening out on the bottom is to place the dough on rice.
Roll the other 2 logs in the black sesame seeds and wrap in parchment paper or plastic.
Chill the cookie dough in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). For a convection oven, reduce cooking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC). Prepare a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
Once the dough is chilled, use a sharp knife to cut dough into 8 slices of even thickness.
Cut the rest of the cookie dough and transfer to the baking sheet lined with parchment paper. If the dough is no longer chilled, you can put the baking sheet in the refrigerator for 15 minutes until the cookies are chilled and firm. Tip: If the cookie dough is chilled, they will not completely lose their shape.
Bake the chilled cookies for 20-22 minutes or until lightly browned on the edges.
Remove from the oven and allow to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
To Store:

Gather all the ingredients. You will also need eight 4-oz (120-ml) ramekins.
1: To Make Caramel Sauce:
Prepare boiling water (you will only need 2 Tbsp) and a cold damp towel (for Step 4).
In a small saucepan, combine ⅔ cup (140 g) sugar and 2 Tbsp water over medium heat. Stir a few times and let the sugar dissolved.
Once the mixture comes to a boil, about 4 minutes, lower the heat to simmer. Gently swirl and tilt the pot around the heat (don't stir it) to distribute the color evenly until it becomes amber (like darker honey), about 6 minutes.
Once it reaches the desired amber color, immediately remove the pot from heat to a cold damp towel and add 2 Tbsp boiling water. It will create a huge splash so please be careful. You can shield yourself with a lid or wear oven mitts to protect your hands. Stir the saucepan to mix together. This will slightly thin out the caramel sauce and ensure it doesn’t become too thick in the ramekins.
[Optional] Briefly dip the ramekins in hot water to warm up and shake off excess water. This will prevent the caramel from solidifying.
While caramel is still hot, evenly distribute the caramel among the 8 ramekins. Set aside and let the caramel thicken naturally (which is why the caramel will not mix with the custard mixture later).
2: To Make Custard
In a small heat-resistant bowl, cut 4 gelatin sheets* into thin ½ inch (1.3 cm) strips. Add ¼ cup (60 ml) water to the bowl and set aside for 5-6 minutes until the gelatin “blooms” (expands). Make sure the bowl is larger than the opening of the saucepan you'll be using in Step 3 below.
In a saucepan bring 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water to simmer and place the bowl of gelatin mixture over the saucepan. Steam will immediately warm up the glass bowl and start dissolving the gelatin. Turn off the heat and set aside. If somehow you end up taking a longer time to do the following process and the gelatin has set into a solid, you will need to melt it back into a liquid with double boiler again.
In a large mixing bowl, whisk together 4 egg yolks and ⅓ cup + 1 Tbsp (80 g) sugar until pale and creamy.
In a medium saucepan, heat ⅔ cup (150 ml) milk over medium heat until the milk is warm to the touch. We’ll be using the other half of milk later on.
Slowly add in the warm milk, whisking constantly (tempering the egg mixture).
Pour the mixture back into the saucepan. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture coats a spoon with a thin film, or small bubbles start to form at the edges of the saucepan, or reaches 160ºF (71ºC). Keep an eye on the pot ALL THE TIME; otherwise the mixture will burn on the bottom.
Add in the gelatin mixture (from Step 2 above) and mix well. Remove from the heat.
Strain the mixture through a fine sieve into a clean bowl. Stir in the rest of the milk (⅔ cup, 150 ml).
Add ½ cup (120 ml) heavy whipping cream and 2 tsp vanilla. We’re adding them at the end to help the mixture cool down faster.
Whisk all together. Transfer the mixture into a large cup with a pout (optional).
Divide the custard into the 8 ramekins. Cover with plastic wrap and chill in the fridge overnight or up to 3 days. The caramel on the bottom will become thinner after the moisture from the custard transfers to the caramel.
Day 2 – Making Dorayaki
Gather all the ingredients.
In a large bowl, combine 4 eggs, ⅔ cup (140 g) sugar, and 2 Tbsp honey and whisk well until the mixture becomes fluffy.
Sift 1 ⅓ cup (160 g) all-purpose flour and 1 tsp baking powder into the bowl and mix all together.
Keep in the fridge to rest for 15 minutes.
About 5 minutes before taking out the batter from the fridge, start heating a large non-stick frying pan over low heat. It's best to take your time and heat the pan slowly so there will be no hot spots. I keep the heat setting to the lowest for 5 minutes.
Take out the batter from the refrigerator. The batter should be slightly smoother now. Stir in 2 Tbsp* of water and whisk to combine until the batter reaches the ribbon stage (When you lift the whisk over the mixture, the batter falls slowly forming thick ribbons which hold their shape atop the batter). *Depends on the size of eggs and how accurate your flour measurement is, the water amount may vary, so start adding 1 Tbsp first, then slowly add more if needed.
Dip a paper towel in 1 tsp vegetable oil and coat the bottom of the pan with the oil. Then wipe off the oil completely (that's the key for evenly golden brown dorayaki surface).
With a ladle or a small measuring cup (I use a 4 Tbsp measuring cup), pour 3 Tbsp of the batter from 3"" (8 cm) above the pan to create 3"" (8 cm) diameter pancakes. Set timer for 90 seconds (with my gas stove ""low setting"" and frying pan).
Using an offset spatula, release the edges of the pancake, and then switch to a larger spatula and flip. Cook the other side for 30 seconds and then transfer to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or silicone baking mat. You do not need to oil the pan again. Continue making pancakes; you can make about 12 3-inch (8-cm) pancakes total.
Final Step – Assembly
To serve, run a small sharp knife around the edge of each ramekin to loosen the custard.
Place a pancake on your serving plate and invert the custard onto the center of the pancake. If it doesn’t release right away, gently shake the ramekin a few times or insert a knife/toothpick around the edges to release the custard. Place another pancake on top to sandwich the purin. Enjoy!

Gather all the ingredients.
Option 1: Pressure Cooker
Rinse the azuki beans carefully until water is clear. Discard any damaged beans that are floating. Drain water and transfer the beans to the pressure cooker (I use an Instant Pot).
Add in 4 cups of water. Cover and lock the lid of your pressure cooker. Make sure the steam release handle points at “sealing” and not venting.
Turn on your pressure cooker and select High Pressure for 15 minutes (10 minutes if you prefer to keep the beans slightly firm). If you’re using an Instant Pot, press “Manual” or “Pressure Cooker”, select “high pressure” and adjust the cooking time.
If you are using a stovetop pressure cooker, cook on high heat until high pressure is reached. Then reduce the heat to low to maintain the pressure for 15 minutes.
When it’s done cooking, the Instant Pot will switch automatically to the “Keep Warm” mode. Let the pressure slowly release by itself for 30 minutes (Natural Release). Before opening the lid, turn the steam release handle to “Venting” and release any leftover pressure. If you’re using the stovetop pressure cooker, remove the pot from the heat and let the pressure release naturally.
Add salt and sugar into the pot.
Press the “Saute” button and select “Low” heat. Let the sugar dissolved completely, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes.
After cooking for 5 minutes, the soup will be a bit darker in color, too. Keep warm and start preparing the mochi (please scroll down).
Option 2: Stovetop Method
Rinse the azuki beans carefully until water is clear. Discard any damaged beans that are floating and drain.
Put the azuki beans and water in a pot.
Bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat. Once boiling, put an otoshibuta (drop lid) over the azuki beans. Turn down the heat to medium-low and keep it simmering for the next 1 to 1.5 hours. Tip: Otoshibuta will prevent the beans from dancing around too much. You can make it with aluminum foil.
Water will evaporate so you need to keep adding water so the beans are submerged. After 1 hour, pick one bean and mash it with your fingers. If it is mashed easily, it's done. Otherwise, cook another 15 minutes and check. Add sugar and salt and let the sugar dissolved completely, stirring occasionally. Keep warm and start preparing the mochi (please scroll down).
★ Making Zenzai with Red Bean Paste (Makes 1) ★
In a small saucepan, combine the store-bought red bean paste or homemade red bean paste and water and bring it to a boil. Add a pinch of salt and mix well. Adjust the consistency by adding or evaporating water. Keep warm and start preparing the mochi (see next step).
★ To Prepare Mochi and Serve ★
Cut the kirimochi into halves or quarters and place them in the toaster oven (or the oven). If you're using the fresh homemade mochi, add it in the soup to warm up. If it's frozen, then boil it in a pot till soft.
Toast the mochi until puffed up and nicely brown, about 10-12 minutes.

Meanwhile cut fruits for the jelly.
The thickness of the fruits should be about the same.
When the bottom layer is slightly set (not liquid or completely set), place the fruits on top. If the bottom layer set too firm, the top layer will not attach to the bottom layer well and the fruit jelly will separate into the top and bottom layers when you cut. The liquid in the saucepan should not be solidified since the saucepan is still warm and it has more liquid in there. If solidify, then re-heat till it turns to liquid.
Then pour the rest of the mixture and pop/remove the bubbles. Keep in the fridge until the jelly has set completely.

Meyer Lemon Chiffon Cake,Namiko Chen,https://www.justonecookbook.com/meyer-lemon-chiffon-cake/,Japanese,https://www.justonecookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Meyer-Lemon-Chiffon-Cake-2103-I.jpg,"['3 large eggs (50 g each w/o shell) ((separated))', '3 oz sugar ((measure ½ cup and remove 1 Tbsp; separated))', '3 Tbsp neutral-flavored oil (vegetable, canola, etc)', '2 Meyer lemons ((for zesting and juicing))', '2.6 oz cake flour', '1 tsp baking powder', '2 Tbsp confectioners’ sugar/powdered sugar ((for sprinkling on the cake))', '½ cup confectioners’ sugar/powdered sugar', '½ Meyer lemon ((for 1 Tbsp juice))']","Gather all the ingredients. You will also need a 17cm (7"") chiffon cake pan. Make sure you use the correct chiffon cake pan. The best types are the aluminum ones with a removable base (Do not use non-stick bakeware for chiffon cake – it will not work). Do not grease the mold because the cake needs to cling on the sides and center of the pan for support as it rises or it will collapse.
Preheat the oven to 340ºF (170ºC). For a convection oven, reduce cooking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC). Separate 3 eggs to yolks and whites. Egg yolks in a large bowl, and whites in a smaller bowl.
In the bowl with egg yolks, add roughly ⅓ of granulated sugar and whisk until creamy pale yellow color.
Add 3 Tbsp (40 ml) vegetable oil and zest of 1-2 Meyer lemons (I love more zest in the cake so I use 2, but you can use one).
Cut Meyer lemons in half. Juice all of it (4 halves).
If you don’t have 4 Tbsp (¼ cup or 60 ml) of juice, add water.
Add 4 Tbsp (¼ cup or 60 ml) juice to the egg mixture and whisk well.
Sift 75 g (2.6 oz) cake flour and 1 tsp baking powder into the egg mixture. Whisk until totally incorporated and make sure there are no lumps.
Using a stand mixer (make sure there is no trace of water or oil), whip the egg whites on medium low sped (speed 4) till opaque, foamy and bubbly. Add ⅓ of the remaining granulated sugar and continue whipping.
After 30 seconds or so, increase the stand mixer speed to high (speed 10) and add the remaining sugar slowly in small increments.
It takes about 2-3 minutes until stiff peaks form (from the moment you switched to speed 10, but this is just a rough estimate). To check on stiff peaks, pull up your whisk and see if the egg whites go straight up (stiff peak) and just the tip is soft enough that it folds over, like taking a bow.
Using a whisk, fold in ⅓ of the egg whites in the batter until the mixture is homogeneous.
Fold in the rest of egg whites in 2-3 increments and mix gently until the mixture is homogeneous.
Pour the batter into the ungreased 17 cm (7”) chiffon cake pan in same location to prevent from forming more bubbles.
To remove or prevent air pockets before baking, run a skewer (chopstick, knife or spatula) through the batter and then drop the pan gently on the kitchen counter a few times.
Bake at 340ºF (170ºC) for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean and the top of the cake springs back when gently pressed. If the top gets burn too quickly, cover the top loosely with aluminum foil.
As soon as you take out the cake pan from the oven, drop it gently on the kitchen counter to stop shrinking. The cake must be cooled upside down in its pan so that it stretches downward instead of collapsing. Stick the cake pan on a tall heavy bottle or invert the cake pan onto a cooling rack (if you use angel food cake pan). Let it cool completely.
To extract the cake, run a thin sharp knife or thin offset spatula around both the outer and inner edge of the cake.
Remove the cake from the pan and run the knife on the bottom. Move onto a serving plate.
Dust powder sugar on top, if you like, and enjoy!
[Optional] To Make Meyer Lemon Icing Glaze, place powder sugar in a small bowl and stir in 1 Tbsp. Meyer lemon juice using the half Meyer lemon you kept from step 4. The glaze should be thick, but pourable. Add more sugar or Meyer lemon juice as necessary to achieve desired consistency.

Wash the strawberries well, especially the leaf area, and dry them completely with paper towel.
Cut the chocolate into smaller pieces and put it in a microwave-safe medium glass bowl.
First, microwave 30 seconds. Make sure to adjust the power to 50%/medium. If you don’t know how to change the power, do 15 seconds intervals. When microwave beeps, take it out and stir with a spoon. Remember, your chocolate will NOT look melted until you stir it.
From the second time, microwave (50% power) for 15 seconds till the chocolate melts. Make sure to stir very well after each interval because even though it “looks” the chocolate hasn’t melted, when you stir it is very soft and the chocolate can be very soft already. Also, if you use chocolate chips, microwave in even shorter intervals because it's easily burnt.
As the chocolate softens, microwave in shorter intervals like 5-8 seconds. When the chocolate is almost completely melted, no more microwave. Just stir it vigorously so the remaining heat will melt the chocolate.
After the chocolate has completely melted, hold the bowl in one hand and grab the stem of strawberry gently with the other hand and dip in the chocolate mixture.
Hold for a few seconds to let the excess drip off.
Place on the parchment paper and push the strawberry slightly forward so the excess chocolate won’t be collected in front of the strawberry (won't look good). Keep in the fridge until you are ready to serve.
If you want to decorate your chocolate covered strawberries as shown in the pictures, put half of the dark chocolate bars into microwavable Ziploc bag (large one). Break into smaller pieces and microwave 15 seconds intervals. Smush the bag to make sure all the chocolate chunks are melted.
With a scissor, make a small hole to pipe on the strawberry, making a zigzag pattern.

In a large bowl, add the lima beans and rinse them under running water. Then soak them in plenty of water overnight (8 to 12 hours; require longer hours in winter).
After 8-12 hours, you can easily remove the beans’ skin with your fingers. Discard the skin.
Add the beans in the pot and pour cold water just enough to cover the beans. To properly cook the beans, you will use just enough water and don’t let the beans move around in the water.
Bring it to a boil on medium heat. Let it boil for 2 minutes while foam starts to appear.
Drain the water into the sieve. Quickly rinse the pot and put the beans back in the pot. Add cold water just enough to cover the beans.
Cover with a lid (slightly ajar and let simmer on low heat until beans become tender, about 1.5 to 2 hours. You can shorten the cooking time by using a pressure cooker (high pressure for 15-20 minutes).
Once in a while check the beans and skim off the foam on the surface. This helps to make the white paste even whiter. Add a bit more water if the water is not covering the beans. Make sure the amount of water is just enough to cover the beans.
When you can easily crush the beans between two fingers, it’s done.
Drain the liquid. You may want to save a little bit of cooking liquid for the next step.
Transfer a small portion of drained beans to your fine-meshed strainer (this tool is also a flour sifter) over a large plate. Press the beans through the strainer using a wooden spatula. You will get a finer and smoother paste built up under the sieve/over the plate. If it’s too dry, put a tiny bit of cooking liquid on the beans before pressing. Alternatively, you can use a food processor to puree the beans. Add a little bit of cooking liquid if necessary.
Put the paste in a clean saucepan. Add the sugar and salt and mix well to combine.
Turn on the heat to medium low heat and let the sugar dissolve. The paste will become liquidy.
Then let the moisture evaporate from the mixture on medium low heat until it becomes a smooth mold-able paste, roughly 15-20 minutes. Keep an eye on the paste all the time to make sure it doesn't burn. When you can draw a line on the bottom of the pan, it’s done. The paste will continue to evaporate as it cools down, remove from the heat and pot immediately.

Cut the unsalted butter into smaller pieces (so that they will soften faster). It’s important to soften the butter before we start.
Separate salt pickled cherry blossoms into 2 groups: good flowers for decoration on the cookies, and 1 Tbsp of damaged flowers for blending in the cookie dough.
To remove saltiness, soak each group of flowers in water (separately) for at least 30 minutes.
Squeeze water out from 1 Tbsp of damaged flowers and pat dry with a paper towel.
Then mince the flowers and set aside.
Pick up the good flowers from the water, shape the petals nicely, and place the each flower on paper towel. Cover with another sheet of paper towel and gently pat dry. Set aside.
Sift the cake flour and add the salt in the same bowl.
In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or in a large bowl with a hand mixer, beat the butter until smooth and creamy.

Add the egg yolk and mix well until combined.
Gradually add 1 cup cake flour (120 g) and blend until the dough is smooth.
Add minced cherry blossoms and blend well.
Because the dough will be still too soft to roll into a log shape, cover the bowl with plastic wrap (or take out the dough from the bowl and wrap with plastic wrap) and keep in the fridge for 1 hour.
Shape the dough into a cylinder, about 1.5 inches (4 cm) diameter.
Wrap in plastic wrap and chill in refrigerator until firm, at least 2 hours. Optional; you can place the dough on a bed of rice while chilling. It’ll help keep the dough in nice cylindrical shape, so your cookie slices won’t be flat on one side.

Remove the plastic wrap, and then wrap around the dough with a damp paper towel so that the dough will be slightly wet. Or of course, you can use traditional method and brush egg wash on the dough (but damp paper towel method works every time for me).
In a tray that fits the cookie dough, sprinkle the white sparkling sugar. Remove the damp paper towel and roll the cookie log on the sparkling sugar.
With a sharp knife, slice the dough into ⅓ inches (7 mm)-thick rounds. Place them on the baking sheet, leaving about 1” (2.5 cm) between rounds.
Gently press down the reserved cherry blossom and decorate on the cookie rounds. Tip: If the cookies are left out too long, place in the refrigerator for 10-15 minutes until the cookies are chilled (or the freezer for a short time); otherwise, the butter melts too quickly in the oven and the cookies will be flat.

Make sure the butter, eggs, and milk are all at room temperature. It’s important! Center a rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 350ºF (180ºC). For a convection oven, reduce cooking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC).
I use the leftover butter on the butter wrapping paper to grease the pan (8.5 x 4.5 x 2.75 inches). Then place the parchment paper inside the pan (paper will stick to the butter).
Put the softened butter in a large bowl and beat it with medium speed until it is light and fluffy (pale color) and lots of little tails foam around the beaters, about 1-2 minutes. Tip: This process adds air to the mixture, and it is crucial for the light and delicate texture of the pound cake.
Add the sugar to the whipped butter. Crean the butter and sugar thoroughly with medium speed (not high speed), about 5 minutes, until it is light and fluffy. The color is pale and sugar is completely dissolved. Tip: The sharp sugar grains cut through the butter and create the tiny air pockets that aerate the batter and cause leavening. This process is very important for the light and delicate texture of the pound cake.
Crack the eggs in a small bowl and whisk well.
IMPORTANT: To achieve a smooth mixture (not a curdled mixture), add in a very small amount (1 Tbsp) of the whisked egg in the mixture and beat well after each addition. Tip: The eggs contain water and the yolks and the butter are fats. Remember, oil and water will not mix without an emulsifier (in this case, the yolks), which suspends fat molecules in water making a smooth mixture.
If there is a slightly curdled appearance to the batter after adding the eggs, don’t worry. The emulsification is usually complete enough that the batter will become smooth with the addition of flour. The flour helps absorb some of the excess water.
Add the dry ingredients in 3 additions. In a fine-mesh strainer/sifter, add a mixture of 200 g (1 ½ cup) cake flour, 1 tsp baking powder, and ¼ tsp salt and sift a third of it over the egg mixture. Switch to a silicone spatula (or with mixer on the lowest speed), and mix the mixture by hand so you can scrape to the bottom of the bowl to get any little pockets of flour.
Now add another third of the dry ingredients and mix.
Stir in the last third addition. Mix only until the batter is smooth. Tip: Even though we are using a low protein cake flour, excess mixing will develop the gluten and the cake will rise nicely in the oven, then sink as soon as you pull it out. And the sinking cake is what makes a tougher cake and dense, moist, gluey streaks.
Heat 60 ml (¼ cup) milk in a microwave or saucepan until warm (roughly body temperature) and gradually add the milk to 20 g (3 Tbsp) matcha in the bowl, 1 Tbsp of milk at a time. Whisk well till combined. Tip: Warm liquid is easier to blend matcha.
Take ⅓ of the batter and add to the bowl with matcha.
Fold in just until the batter is smooth and homogenous. Do not overmix.
Add 6-8 dollops of matcha batter into the original batter. Then fold the entire batter from the bottom of the bowl THREE (3) times.
Pour the batter into the pan without mixing the batter, keeping the swirl effect. Tap the cake pan on the countertop once to release the trapped air.
Using the offset spatula, smooth out the surface without mixing too much.
Put the cake pan in the oven and lower the oven temperature to 340ºF (170ºC) oven for 50 to 60 minutes.
After 15 minutes, open the oven and quickly score the top of the cake with a sharp knife (Read the blog post why we do this). Continue to bake.
The cake is done when a wooden skewer inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean.
Remove from the oven and allow the cake to rest in the pan for 15 minutes on a wire rack before taking the cake out of the pan to cool completely. Enjoy!

Preheat the oven to 375ºF (190ºC). For a convection oven, reduce cooking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC). Line a 15” x 10” (38 cm x 25 cm) jelly roll pan with parchment paper.
Separate the egg yolks and whites into two bowls. Keep the egg whites in the refrigerator, and the egg yolk at room temperature.
Make the cake batter:
Using a fine mesh sieve, sift the cake flour, baking powder, and matcha powder over a sheet of parchment paper.
Transfer the dry ingredients into the bowl, set the sieve over the parchment paper and sift 2 more times (total 3 times).
In a large bowl, add the egg yolks and break them.
Add half of the sugar (¼ cup, 50 g) and whisk until the egg mixture becomes double in volume. When you lift the whisk into the air with some of the mixture on it, the mixture should fall back into the bowl in ribbons, which slowly disappear back into the mixture
Add the cold egg whites into a large bowl. With an electric hand mixer (or stand mixer), beat the egg whites until foamy.
Gradually add the remaining sugar (¼ cup, 50 g) over three separate times and beat until stiff peaks form and egg whites are glossy.
Gently whisk in ⅓ of the egg whites to the egg yolk mixture until incorporated in the batter.
Then add the mixture back into the egg whites. Gently fold in egg whites with a silicone spatula. Tip: Rotate the bowl counterclockwise while you scoop up and fold in the mixture clockwise.
Add the dry ingredients. Using the silicone spatula, fold in gently until just incorporated. Tip: Adding dry ingredients last prevents from mixing too much (over-mixing the batter will result in dense, not fluffy sponge cake).
Add the warm milk and fold in until incorporated.
Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Spread the batter evenly with silicone pastry scraper.
Bake in the oven:
Tap the jelly roll pan a few times on your working surface to remove the air bubble inside the batter. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until an inserted toothpick comes out clean and top of cake springs back when touched. Make sure not to over bake or the cake will be too dry and break when you roll.
Remove the pan from the oven and drop the pan on your working space once to prevent the cake from shrinkage.
While the pan is still hot, place a sheet of parchment paper and a baking sheet (or a cutting board) on top.
Wearing the oven mitts, flip the baking sheets together (with the cake sandwiched in between). Using a knife or spatula, lift the jelly roll pan to reveal the cake.
Gently remove the parchment paper attached to the cake. This side will be the exterior of the Swiss roll, so be gentle!
Place another “protective” sheet of parchment paper and baking sheet on top.
Hold both baking sheets and flip the cake over so that brown side is facing up. Remove the parchment paper.
Remove the baking sheet and place the cake on the working surface. Diagonally slice off ¼ inch (1 cm) one side of the cake (shorter end). This will help stabilize the Swiss roll when rolled up.
While the cake is still warm, use your hands to slowly roll the cake on the parchment paper. Once the cake is rolled up, transfer to a wire rack.
Cover with kitchen towel and let it cool completely (until it reaches room temperature, about 30 minutes).
To prepare matcha cream filling
When the cake is completely cool, combine the heavy cream, sugar, and matcha powder in a large bowl.
Beat until firm and spreadable, so it won’t ooze out of the cake when you’re rolling it up.
Assemble the Swiss cake:
Transfer the swiss roll to a flat surface and unroll the cake. It’s okay if the ends curl up a bit.
Using an offset spatula, spread the matcha cream mixture evenly over the cake, leaving a ½-inch border on all sides. A little tip: Spread slightly less amount of filling toward the last ⅓ of cake as the cream will pile up toward the end when rolling up.

Easy Apple Tart,Namiko Chen,https://www.justonecookbook.com/easy-apple-tart/,Japanese,https://www.justonecookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Easy-Apple-Tart-2826-I.jpg,"['1 frozen puff pastry sheet ((each box comes with 2 sheets))', '1 ½ Tbsp unsalted butter ((cold))', '2 apples ((I used fuji apple))', '1 Tbsp confectioners’ sugar/powdered sugar', '2 Tbsp apricot jam ((can substitute it with apple sauce or fig jam))', '2 tsp water', '1 large egg yolk', '1 tsp water', '2 Tbsp sugar', '¼ tsp cinnamon powder ((optional))']","Gather all your ingredients. Preheat the oven to 400ºF (200ºC). For a convection oven, reduce cooking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC). Cut the cold butter into small cubes.
Allow the puff pastry sheet to thaw on a sheet of parchment paper for about 15-20 minutes, then carefully unfold it. When the dough is thawed, use a rolling pin to roll out the dough: it helps make the dough more even and connects the folding creases (if there are any). Once puff pastry sheet has thawed, work quickly while it’s still cold. If the sheet reaches room temperature, return to the fridge to chill (but not refreeze).
With a sharp knife, score a ¾ -inch (2 cm) border around the edge of the puff pastry sheet to create a crust (Do not cut all the way through the dough). Poke the inner square (rectangle) all over with a fork. Transfer the puff pastry sheet with parchment paper to a rimmed baking sheet.
In a small bowl, add 2 Tbsp apricot jam and 1 tsp water. Stir well to combine so it’s easy to spread.
In another small bowl, combine the egg yolk and 1 tsp water. Whisk well together.
In another small bowl, combine 2 Tbsp sugar and ¼ tsp cinnamon powder.
Peel, core, and cut the apples into ⅛ inch (3 mm) thick slices. Try to keep the slices stacked together so you can easily spread and fan out on the puff pastry.
Evenly spread the apricot glaze in the center of the pastry sheet.
Arrange the apple slices on the jam, overlapping slightly and fanning them out as you go. You may end up not using all the apple slices, just eat and enjoy them.
Sprinkle with sugar and cinnamon mixture. Brush around the crust with the egg wash. And then place the butter cubes over the apples.
Bake at 400ºF (200ºC) for about 22 to 25 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown.
Transfer the pan to a wire rack and cool for at least 10 minutes before slicing. If you like, sprinkle powder sugar on top and/or serve with vanilla ice cream.

Prep Time: 20 mins | Freezing Time: Minimum 12 hours)
Put a glass bowl in the freezer in preparation for whipping the cream.
Whisk the egg whites until they form soft peaks.
Heat the honey in a pan until it starts to bubble. Pour it hot onto the egg whites then whisk for another minute or two.
Whip the cream in the chilled bowl until it’s stiff. Add the nuts and fruit (but keep some aside for the decoration) and fold the mixture gently into the beaten egg whites.
Pour into mini muffin molds (I used silicone), or simply into a sealed container and freeze.

Once boiling, quickly add the flour and whisk until the dough is smooth and comes away from the sides of the pan.
Transfer to a mixing bowl (or electric mixer) and gradually add the eggs. Whisk until you have a lovely smooth, sticky paste. At this point, you can transfer the pastry to a piping bag and keep refrigerated for up to 5 days.
Using a piping bag, pipe out small heaps on baking trays covered in greaseproof/baking paper (or Silpat) Leave a good space between each mound, as they will spread out during baking.
Brush with a glaze of one egg yolk mixed with a tablespoon of water. Bake in the oven for 20 minutes.
Orange Caramel Sauce (Prep Time: 5 mins | Cooking Time: 20 mins)

Equipment you will need:12 aluminum/silicone cupcake liners, a cookie dough scoop (smaller than an ice cream scooper), a rolling pin, and a 3.5 inch (9 cm) cookie cutter or a round bowl/glass cup.
Using the cookie scoop, scoop out ice cream into aluminum/silicone cupcake liners. The ice cream will melt quickly so I recommend freezing them immediately for a few hours or until ice cream balls are completely frozen solid.
Once the ice cream balls are frozen solid and ready, you can start making mochi. Combine shiratamako and sugar in a medium bowl and whisk all together.
Add water and mix well until combined.
Microwave Method: If you’re using a microwave to cook mochi, cover the bowl with some plastic wrap (do not cover too tight). Put the bowl in the microwave and heat it on high heat (1000w) for 1 minute. Take it out and stir with a wet rubber spatula. Cover again and cook for 1 minute. Stir again, cover, and cook for 30 seconds to finish cooking. The color of mochi should change from white to almost translucent.
Steaming Method: If you’re using a steamer, cover the steamer lid with a towel so the condensation won’t drop into the mochi mixture. Put the bowl into a steamer basket and cover to cook for 15 minutes. Half way cooking, stir with wet rubber spatula and cover to finish cooking. The color of mochi should change from white to almost translucent.
Cover the work surface with parchment paper and dust it generously with potato starch. Then transfer the cooked mochi on top.
To prevent from sticking, sprinkle more potato starch on top of the mochi. Once it’s cool down a bit, you can spread the mochi into a thin layer with your hands or with a rolling pin. Make sure to apply potato starch on your hands and the rolling pin. I recommend using a rolling pin because it’s easier to evenly spread out.
Transfer the mochi with parchment paper onto a large baking sheet. Refrigerate for 15 minutes until the mochi is set.
Take out the mochi from the refrigerator and cut out 7-8 circles with the cookie cutter.
Dust off the excess potato starch with a pastry brush. If you find some sticky part, cover the area with potato starch first then dust off. Place a plastic wrap on a plate and then mochi wrapper on top, then lay another layer of plastic wrapper down. Repeat for all wrappers. With leftover mochi dough, roll into a ball and then flatten into a thin layer again and cut out into more circle wrappers (I could make about 12 mochi wrappers).
Now we’re ready to form mochi ice cream balls. On the work surface, place one sheet of plastic wrap with a mochi layer on top. Take out one ice cream ball from the freezer and put it on top of the mochi wrapper. Pinch the four corners of the mochi layer together to wrap the ice cream ball.
When mochi gets sticky, put some potato starch on the sticky area and seal the opening. Quickly cover with the plastic wrap and twist to close. Place each mochi ice cream into a cupcake pan to keep the shape. You will need to work on one mochi ice cream at a time in order to keep the ice cream frozen all times. Put mochi ice cream back into the freezer for a few hours.

For an easy transfer, I use aluminum cup liners to hold Ohagi (Botamochi). You can get it in the bento section at a Japanese grocery store.
To Prepare the Rice
Combine the glutinous rice and rice together in a large bowl and rinse the rice a few times.
Use your fingers to gently wash the rice in a circular motion for 10-15 seconds. Repeat this process 1-2 times. Add water and discard the water. Repeat this process 1-2 times. When the water is almost clear, drain well.
Transfer the drained rice to the rice cooker. Add water (600 ml for my 3 rice cooker cups).
Let soak for 20 minutes and press “start” to cook on regular rice cooking mode.
To Prepare the Toppings/Filling
While the rice is being cooked, prepare the toppings/fillings. Grind sesame seeds with a pestle in a Japanese mortar.
Transfer to a medium bowl and add sugar. Mix well together.
In another medium bowl, combine soybean flour and sugar and mix well together.
Using a small cookie scoop, make red bean paste balls. Each scoop/ball should be 2 teaspoons (0.7 oz or 20 g) of red bean paste.
To Pound Cooked Rice
When the rice is almost finished cooking, make saltwater by combining 1 cup water and 1 tsp salt. Mix well together. This is for soaking the wooden rolling pin or pestle before pounding the glutinous rice.
Once the rice is cooked, remove the rice cooker bowl from the cooker. While it’s hot, start pounding with the wooden pestle or rolling pin.
The wooden rolling pin gets sticky from the glutinous rice. Soak it every few poundings. Stop pounding when the glutinous rice is half mashed/pounded (This is up to your liking. The rice should be mostly mashed but you can still see some rice grains).
To make the soybean flour/sesame-coated Ohagi (Botamochi)
Moisten your hands with the saltwater and grab a small amount of pounded glutinous rice (1.4 oz or 40 g). Fatten it to make a round shape.
Once it’s about 2 ½ inch diameter, put one Anko ball in the middle.
Carefully gather up the pounded glutinous rice around the Anko to enclose the filling.
Pinch the seam and form the rice ball into a small oval-shaped ball.
Moisten the plate or tray with saltwater and transfer the oval-shaped rice balls.
To make the soybean flour-coated Ohagi (Botamochi), put the rice ball (with Anko filling) in the soybean flour mix. Rotate a few times to coat well with the mixture and transfer to an aluminum foil liner.
To make the sesame-coated Ohagi (Botamochi), put the rice ball (with Anko filling) in the black sesame mix. Rotate a few times to coat well with the mixture and transfer to an aluminum liner.
To make the Anko-coated Ohagi (Botamochi),
Make a small oval-shaped ball with the pounded glutinous rice (1.4 oz or 40 g).
Using a small cookie scoop, spread 2 scoops of Anko (total of 4 teaspoons, 1.4 oz or 40 g) into a round, flat shape on a piece of plastic wrap.
Put the rice ball on top and evenly coat the Anko around the rice ball.
Pull the plastic wrap and spread the Anko evenly and transfer it to an aluminum liner.
To Serve
When you’re ready to serve Ohagi (Botamochi), reapply the black sesame and soybean flour mixture. Serve them with green tea.

Preheat the oven to 375ºF (190ºC). For a convection oven, reduce cooking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC). Line a 15” x 10” (38 cm x 25 cm) jelly roll pan with parchment paper.
Separate the egg yolks and whites into two bowls. Keep the egg whites in the refrigerator, and the egg yolk at room temperature.
Make the cake batter:
Using a fine mesh sieve, sift the cake flour, baking powder, and matcha powder over a sheet of parchment paper.
Transfer the dry ingredients into the bowl, set the sieve over the parchment paper and sift 2 more times (total 3 times).
In a large bowl, add the egg yolks and break them.
Add half of the sugar (¼ cup, 50 g) and whisk until the egg mixture becomes double in volume. When you lift the whisk into the air with some of the mixture on it, the mixture should fall back into the bowl in ribbons, which slowly disappear back into the mixture
Add the cold egg whites into a large bowl. With an electric hand mixer (or stand mixer), beat the egg whites until foamy.
Gradually add the remaining sugar (¼ cup, 50 g) over three separate times and beat until stiff peaks form and egg whites are glossy.
Gently whisk in ⅓ of the egg whites to the egg yolk mixture until incorporated in the batter.
Then add the mixture back into the egg whites. Gently fold in egg whites with a silicone spatula. Tip: Rotate the bowl counterclockwise while you scoop up and fold in the mixture clockwise.
Add the dry ingredients. Using the silicone spatula, fold in gently until just incorporated. Tip: Adding dry ingredients last prevents from mixing too much (over-mixing the batter will result in dense, not fluffy sponge cake).
Add the warm milk and fold in until incorporated.
Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Spread the batter evenly with silicone pastry scraper.
Bake in the oven:
Tap the jelly roll pan a few times on your working surface to remove the air bubble inside the batter. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until an inserted toothpick comes out clean and top of cake springs back when touched. Make sure not to over bake or the cake will be too dry and break when you roll.
Remove the pan from the oven and drop the pan on your working space once to prevent the cake from shrinkage.
While the pan is still hot, place a sheet of parchment paper and a baking sheet (or a cutting board) on top.
Wearing the oven mitts, flip the baking sheets together (with the cake sandwiched in between). Using a knife or spatula, lift the jelly roll pan to reveal the cake.
Gently remove the parchment paper attached to the cake. This side will be the exterior of the Swiss roll, so be gentle!
Place another “protective” sheet of parchment paper and baking sheet on top.
Hold both baking sheets and flip the cake over so that brown side is facing up. Remove the parchment paper.
Remove the baking sheet and place the cake on the working surface. Diagonally slice off ¼ inch (1 cm) one side of the cake (shorter end). This will help stabilize the Swiss roll when rolled up.
While the cake is still warm, use your hands to slowly roll the cake on the parchment paper. Once the cake is rolled up, transfer to a wire rack.
Cover with kitchen towel and let it cool completely (until it reaches room temperature, about 30 minutes).
To prepare matcha cream filling
When the cake is completely cool, combine the heavy cream, sugar, and matcha powder in a large bowl.
Beat until firm and spreadable, so it won’t ooze out of the cake when you’re rolling it up.
Assemble the Swiss cake:
Transfer the swiss roll to a flat surface and unroll the cake. It’s okay if the ends curl up a bit.
Using an offset spatula, spread the matcha cream mixture evenly over the cake, leaving a ½-inch border on all sides. A little tip: Spread slightly less amount of filling toward the last ⅓ of cake as the cream will pile up toward the end when rolling up.
Carefully but tightly re-roll the cake. The seam side should be on the bottom. Once you roll up the cake, secure the roll by twisting the parchment paper at both ends (like a candy wrapper). Refrigerate for at least 2 hours to firm up the cream.
Remove and unwrap the Swiss roll. Slice off about ½ inch of the cake on both ends (to show off beautiful swirls). Transfer it to your serving dish. Slice and serve.

[Optional] Blind Baking – Please read the blog post first
Preheat the oven to 400ºF (200ºC). For a convection oven, reduce cooking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC). Take out the pie crust from the freezer and thaw for 10 minutes.
When the pie crust has softened a little bit, prick both bottom and sides of the pie crust with a fork, make sure not to poke through. This allows steam to escape and prevents bubbles from forming from the bottom of the crust. Alternatively, you can use pie weights. Bake the pie crust for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from the oven, let it cool until room temperature.
Kabocha Pie
Put 1 cup of water into the pan (I use a wok) and place the steamer basket on top.
With a very firm chef’s knife, cut kabocha in half and scoop out seeds. Cut kabocha into 1 ½ inch (4 cm) cubes.
Place kabocha cubes in a steamer basket and cover with lid. Turn heat to high and steam for 15 minutes.
After 15 min, check if kabocha ready by inserting the skewer into a thick kabocha cube. If it goes through smoothly, then they’re done. Otherwise, keep steaming and check back in 1 minute. Remove the steamer basket from the pan. When the kabocha is cool enough for you to touch, remove the skin with a knife.
Transfer the kabocha to a food processor or blender. Puree kabocha until smooth. Since the kabocha was steamed and contains a good amount of moisture, you don’t need to add any liquid. However, if the kabocha has been sitting out too long and seems dehydrated, add 1 Tbsp water at a time to help it puree. My kabocha yields about 3 cups (675 g). For this recipe, you will need 2 cups (450 g) of pureed kabocha.
If you don’t have a food processor or blender, transfer kabocha to a large bowl and mash with a fine mesh strainer like this to pass through kabocha for finer texture. You can also use a potato masher but it won’t be as refined.
Preheat the oven to 400ºF (200ºC). For a convection oven, reduce cooking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC). Take out the pie crust from the freezer and thaw for 10 minutes.
In a large bowl, combine 2 Tbsp (30 g) unsalted butter and 2 Tbsp (30 g) granulated sugar. Whisk until it’s a creamy consistency.
Add 1 egg yolk and 2 eggs, one at a time and whisk well to combine before adding next one.
Add 2 cups (450 g) pureed kabocha and mix well to combine.
Add ⅓ cup (72 g) brown sugar, 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice, and ½ tsp kosher salt into the bowl and mix all together.
Add 1 Tbsp rum and ¾ cup + 2 Tbsp (200 ml) heavy whipping cream and whisk well.
Pour the filling into the pie crust. Tap the crust on the counter a few times to make sure there is no air gap in the fillings.
Bake at 400ºF (200ºC) for 15 minutes and then reduce oven temperature to 350ºF (180ºC) and bake for 50 minutes, or until the skewer inserted near the center comes out clean. If you pre-baked the pie crust, you might need to shield the edges with foil to avoid the crust becoming too brown and overdone.
Cool on a wire rack for 2 hours before serving.
To Serve
Serve the pie with a big dollop of fresh whipped cream (recipe follows).
To Make Whipped Cream
Place a metal mixing bowl and metal whisk into the freezer for 10 to 15 minutes (If you don’t use an electric mixer, this step helps you to make whipped cream faster). Add 1 cup (240 ml) heavy whipping cream and 2 Tbsp sugar into the mixing bowl. Whisk just until the cream reaches stiff peaks.
Store any unused portion in an airtight container for up to 24 hours. When ready to use, re-whisk for 10 to 15 seconds.

In a medium microwave-safe glass bowl, mix shiratamako and sugar with a whisk.
Using a silicone spatula, slowly add water in 3 parts and stir until the mixture has reached a thick consistency. Cover loosely with plastic wrap.
First, microwave 1 minute (for 1000W microwave). Mix well with a wet silicone spatula. The mixture is still whitish and floury.
For the second time, microwave 1 minute again, and mix well with the wet silicone spatula. Now it starts to resemble mochi, but there are still some floury parts.

You will also need 8 4-oz ramekins (4 oz is ½ cup or 120 ml).
Caramel Sauce
Prepare boiling water (you will only need 2 Tbsp) and a cold damp towel (for Step 4).
Combine sugar and water in a saucepan over medium heat. Gently shake the saucepan to evenly distribute sugar and do not touch until the mixture starts to turn golden brown. Gently swirl and tilt the pan again to distribute the mixture to have even color until it becomes amber color (like darker honey color), about 6 minutes.
Immediately remove from heat to a cold damp towel and add 2 Tbsp boiling water. It will create a huge splash so please be careful. You can shield with a lid or wear oven mitts to protect your hands. Stir the saucepan to mix together. This will slightly thin out the caramel sauce and ensure that it doesn’t become too thick in the ramekins.
Briefly dip the ramekins in hot water to warm up. This will prevent the caramel from solidifying (just shake off excess water and no need to dry).
While caramel is still hot, evenly distribute the caramel among the 8 ramekins. Set aside and let the caramel thicken naturally (which is why the caramel will not mix with the custard mixture later).
Custard
In a small bowl, cut 4 gelatin sheets into thin ½ inch (1.3 cm) strips. Add ¼ cup (60 ml) cold water and set aside for 5-6 minutes until the gelatin “blooms” (expands).
If you’re using powder gelatin, combine 3 tsp (10 g) gelatin powder and ¼ cup (60 ml) water and let stand for 1 minute. Then microwave on high for 30-40 seconds and stir. It’s ready to use.
Once gelatin sheets are bloomed, bring 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water to simmer and place the bowl of gelatin mixture over the saucepan (double boiler). Make sure to use a heat resistant bowl, which is larger than the opening of the saucepan. Steam will immediately warm up the glass bowl and start dissolving the gelatin. Turn off the heat and set it aside. If somehow you end up taking a long time to do the following process and the gelatin has set into a solid, you will need to melt it back into a liquid with a double boiler again.
In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and sugar until pale and creamy.
In a medium saucepan, heat 200 ml (roughly 1 cup) milk (keep the rest for later) over medium heat until the milk is warm to the touch.
Slowly add the warm milk, whisking constantly (tempering the egg mixture).
Pour the mixture back into the saucepan. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly (keep an eye on the pot ALL THE TIME; otherwise the mixture will burn on the bottom), until the mixture coats a spoon with a thin film or small bubbles start to form at the edges of the pan, or reaches 160ºF (71ºC).
Add in the gelatin mixture and mix well. Remove from the heat.
Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh strainer into a clean bowl.
Add the rest of the milk (200 ml), heavy whipping cream, and vanilla and whisk all together. We’re adding them at the end to help the mixture cool down.
Divide the custard into the 8 ramekins. Cover with plastic wrap and chill in the fridge overnight or up to 3 days. The caramel on the bottom will become thinner after the moisture from the custard transfers to the caramel.
To serve, run a small sharp knife or toothpick around the edge of each ramekin to loosen the custard. Quickly invert each custard onto a plate. If it doesn’t release right away, gently shake the ramekin a few times to help it out.

Prepare the Fillings
In a small bowl, combine 100 g white bean paste (Shiroan) with 2 g matcha (green tea powder).
Using a small spatula or spoon, blend the paste and matcha until the mixture is homogeneous.
Cover the bowl of matcha paste and the other bowl of 100 g white bean paste with plastic wrap. Freeze the bowls of paste for 30 minutes (or refrigerate for 60 minutes) to firm up the texture.
After 30-60 minutes, take out the bowls.
We'll start with the white bean paste first by dividing it into thirds. Wet your hands with water.
Take ⅓ of the paste into your hands and roll into a ball. Continue with the rest.
Transfer to a plate. Don’t worry if they are not perfectly round.
Now we'll work on the matcha paste by dividing into thirds. Wet your hands with water and take ⅓ of the paste into your hands.
Roll each third into a ball. Refrigerate until ready to use.
Make Mochi and Assemble
First, we make white mochi with matcha filling. In a bowl, combine 50 g Shiratamako and 25 g sugar and whisk well.
Add 90 g water and whisk well until there is no lump.
Cover the bowl with a paper towel and microwave for 1 minute (my microwave is 1200W). If you do not have a microwave, you can steam the mixture. Please see the Daifuku recipe and video for the tutorial.
Wet your silicone spatula with water.
Mix the mochi dough so that it will be cooked evenly.
Cover and microwave for an additional 30 seconds (or more/less depends on your microwave strength). The cooked mochi dough will look opaque.
Spread the potato starch or corn starch well on a baking sheet. Remember, mochi dough will stick if the surface is not covered with starch. Transfer the mochi dough on top of the starch.
Sprinkle potato starch on top of the mochi dough and on your hands. Your hands must be well coated; otherwise, they will be very sticky.
Use a dough scraper, divide the mochi dough into equal thirds.
If one is bigger than the other, cut off the edge and add to the center of the smaller dough. Flatten the dough into a circle shape.
Place the matcha paste ball in the center of the dough. Bring all four corners of the dough over the ball.
Bring the rest of the edges to the top.
Pinch the seam line by pulling the mochi dough.
If the dough is too sticky, tap the seam line with potato starch. If the dough is covered with too much potato starch, dust it off and pull the dough at the seam so the sticky surface appears and you can seal the seam.
Once the seam is tightly closed, flip the mochi so the seam line is on the bottom. Twist the mochi a few times on your palm to reshape until even thickness.
Repeat the same for the next 2 mochi dough.
Now, we make the green tea mochi with white bean filling. In a bowl, combine 50 g Shiratamako and 25 g sugar and whisk well.
Add 2 g matcha into the mixture and whisk well.
Add 90 g water and whisk well until there is no lump.

Wet your silicone spatula with water. Mix the mochi dough so that it will be cooked evenly.
Cover and microwave for an additional 30 seconds (or more/less depends on your microwave strength). The cooked mochi dough will look opaque.
Spread the potato starch or cornstarch generously on a baking sheet. Remember, mochi dough will stick if the surface is not covered by the potato starch. Transfer the mochi dough on top of the starch. Sprinkle more starch on top of the mochi dough and on your hands. Your hands must be well coated; otherwise, they will be very sticky.
Use a dough scraper, divide the mochi dough into equal thirds. If one is bigger than the other, cut off the edge and add to the center of the smaller dough.

To Make Soy Sauce Caramel
You can double the recipe but do not increase beyond that because it’s not easy to melt the sugar properly. In a small saucepan, heat ½ cup sugar over medium heat, stirring constantly with a whisk, silicone spatula, or wooden spoon.
Sugar will form clumps and eventually melt into a thick brown, amber-colored liquid as you continue to stir. Careful not to burn from the splatter.
Once sugar is completely melted, immediately add 3 Tbsp butter. The caramel will bubble rapidly so take extra cautions not to burn yourself from the splatter.
Stir the butter into the caramel until it is completely melted. If you notice the butter separating or if the sugar clumped up, remove from heat and vigorously whisk to combine. Keep whisking until it comes back together, even if it takes 3-4 minutes. It will eventually get there. Just keep whisking. Return to heat when it’s combined again.
Very slowly drizzle in ¼ cup of heavy cream while stirring. Since the heavy cream is colder than the caramel, the mixture will rapidly bubble when added. It will rise in the pan as it boils.
Turn off and remove from the heat and stir in 2 Tbsp soy sauce.
Allow it to cool down slightly before use. Caramel thickens as it cools.
After the caramel cools down, pour it into a glass jar or container. Refrigerate for up to 1 month and freezer for up to 3 months. The caramel solidifies as it cools, but you can reheat in the microwave or on the stove so it becomes liquid again. For the frozen caramel, thaw in the refrigerator or at room temperature, then warm up before using.
To Make Vanilla Ice Cream Mixture
Cut the gelatin sheet into 1-inch (2.5 cm) pieces and add ¼ cup water to let the gelatin bloom for 10 minutes.
In a medium saucepan, add 2 cups heavy (whipping) cream and 1 cup whole milk.
Whisk together and bring it to almost simmering over medium-low heat until small bubbles appear along the edges (but don’t let it boil), about 8-10 minutes. If you have a cooking thermometer, it should be 181 °F or 83 °C.
In a large bowl, combine sugar and egg yolks (if you are using gelatin powder, add now).
Whisk together till combine.
Add a quarter of the milk mixture from the pot into the bowl, while constantly whisking (to prevent the eggs from cooking).
Then repeat with another quarter of the mixture, while stirring with the plastic spatula.
Finally, pour everything in the bowl and whisk together. Then pour back the mixture into the pot.
Drain the water from the gelatin sheet and add it to the mixture.
Return the pot to the stove and heat on medium-low, stirring constantly to prevent the mixture from sticking to the bottom of the pot.
Without allowing it to boil, heat for 8-10 minutes, or until the mixture thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon. The cooking thermometer should reach 160 ºF or 71 °C to pasteurize the eggs. Turn heat off and pour the mixture through a fine-mesh strainer into a 4 cup measuring cup or a medium bowl.
Add the vanilla and stir to combine.
Prepare a large bowl with ice cubes, and set the measuring cup (or the medium bowl) inside. Stir the mixture occasionally to help cool faster. Once cool (should take about 30 minutes), cover with plastic wrap and place in refrigerator overnight or at least 4 hours.
To Churn Ice Cream
On the following day (or after 4 hours), set up your ice cream maker according to the instructions. My Cuisinart ice cream maker just broke so I borrowed my friend’s fancy ice cream maker that does not require freezing the bowl in advance. However, many home ice cream freezers have bowls that need to be frozen ahead of time. Don’t skimp on this step! A bowl that isn’t completely frozen will take longer to freeze your ice cream and impact the finished product. If you make homemade ice cream on a regular basis, store your bowl in the freezer once it is clean. It will always be ready for your next batch of ice cream.
Pour the mixture into the ice cream machine. Make sure not to fill it more than about ⅔ of the way up.
Start churning. Churning ice cream incorporates air into the finished product while it freezes, so you will need some extra room in your freezer bowl.
The mixture has been thicker and creamier, about 25-30 minutes.
Lift up the paddle and remove the ice cream with a (mini) silicone spatula into the ice cream maker bowl.
Transfer half the ice cream into an airtight glass container (ideally a square or rectangular shape) and flatten the top with the silicone spatula.
Drizzle generous amount of soy sauce caramel on top.
Add the rest of the ice cream and flatten it with the silicone spatula.
Drizzle more caramel sauce on top. Save some for drizzling when serving.
Cover the lid and put it in the freezer. Set freezer temperature to the coldest setting, so the ice cream freezes faster. Optional: Lay plastic wrap directly on top of ice cream and press down gently to prevent ice crystals from forming on top of the ice cream.
To Serve
Take the ice cream out of the freezer 5-10 minutes before serving, so it becomes soft enough to scoop. Drizzle extra Soy Sauce Caramel on top if you like.",en-US,{},5.0,,Just One Cookbook,1595,1 serving(s)

See the notes below))"", '⅔ cup water', '1 slice kabocha (squash/pumpkin) ((you will need 2 tsp mashed kabocha))']","Gather all the ingredients. Kabocha is very hard to cut. If you have trouble, see my tutorial on How to Cut Kabocha Squash. Bring a big pot of water to boil dango on low heat.
To Prepare Kabocha Squash
Steam a thin slice of Kabocha squash for 13-15 minutes (depending on thickness, cooking time varies).
When a skewer can go through, it’s done. Transfer to a plate or tray. With a spoon, scrape off the flesh. You will need 2 tsp mashed kabocha and set aside.
To Make Dango
Add dangoko in a bowl. Stir in water a little bit a time while mixing with chopsticks. Please note: it is possible that you may need less or more water depending on where you live. I live in a dry climate, so I may use more water than you. The dangoko starts to stick together and eventually it becomes clumps.
Using your hand, combine into one ball. Knead until the dough becomes smooth. The texture is like squeezing an ""earlobe"" (that’s how we describe the tenderness for this type of mochi in Japanese).
Make the dough into a ball. Divide the dough into 8 equal pieces. Then divide each piece into 2 balls. Each ball should be 20 grams. You may have some extra dough, but that’s okay.
To make 2 yellow balls, prepare 30 gram of dough and mix in 2 tsp mashed kabocha.
Combine the kabocha and dough really well. Depending on kabocha, it may contain more moisture. If the dough gets too wet, mix in more Dangoko so the dough will be firmer and easy to make into a ball. If the yellow color is not strong, you can add more mashed kabocha, but you also need to add in more flour to firm up.
You will need 40 grams of yellow dough, and divide into two 20 gram yellow balls, just like the rest of white balls.
Shape into a nice smooth round ball. If the dough is cracking or has some wrinkle, tap your finger in water and apply the small amount of water on the cracked area to smooth out. I have 15 white balls and 2 yellow balls.
Once the water in the pot is boiling, gently drop in each ball into the pot with a continuous motion. We want to cook them all at once, but also keeping them in good shapes. Stir the balls occasionally so they don’t stick on the bottom of the pot.
Dango will stay on the bottom first but once they are cooked, they will float. Then cook an additional 1-2 minute. Transfer them into iced water.
Once the dango is cooled, drain well and transfer to a tray (if you wet the tray, the dumplings won’t stick).
In the boiling water, add the yellow balls. Once floating, transfer to iced water to let cool. Drain and transfer to the tray.
To Arrange Tsukimi Dango
Place 15 dango into a pyramid shape on a plate or tray. From bottom to top, you put 9, 4, and 2 balls.
To Eat Tsukimi Dango
After displaying Tsukimi Dango for hours or a day, the dumplings may have become hard to eat. Then you can cut and toast it in the oven toaster or frying pan. Then coat the dango with sweet soy glaze (mitarashi sauce) following this recipe.",en-US,{},4.25,,Just One Cookbook,60,15 serving(s)

Before we start
Make sure the eggs and butter are at room temperature. Sift the cake flour at least twice.
Place the cake pan on top of parchment paper, trace around the pan and cut out the circle. Grease one side of the parchment paper and also both the bottom and sides of the cake pan with butter. Then fit the parchment paper in the cake pan. (I avoid parchment paper on the side because sometimes it pulls the batter and affects the final result of the cake).
Preheat oven to 350ºF (180ºC). For a convection oven, reduce cooking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC). It’s always better to preheat longer, preferably 15-20 minutes extra. Tip: You preheat the oven so that all the surfaces inside your oven (walls, floor, door, racks) are the desired cooking temperature, which makes for more even temperatures throughout the oven and you won’t lose as much heat when you open the door for a few seconds. Depending on your oven, regular preheating might take 10 to 20 minutes.
Prepare a double boiler. If you have never done this before, please see Notes section below. Turn on the stove’s heat to high and bring the water in the saucepan (Pot A) to a rapid boil. When boiling, reduce heat to maintain a steady simmer. Put the 40g (3 Tbsp) of butter in the small bowl (Bowl #1) and set over the saucepan. Let the butter melt gently.
Once the butter is melted, remove the bowl from the saucepan. Then add 30 ml (2 Tbsp) whole milk and whisk to combine. Set aside to keep it around 104ºF (40ºC).
For the sponge cake
In the stand mixer bowl (Bowl #2), add 4 eggs and break the egg yolks and whites.
Add 120 g (½ cup + 2 Tbsp) sugar and whisk to combine.
In the large pot (Pot B), bring about 2 inches of water to 140ºF or 60ºC and maintain the temperature. Then set the stand mixer bowl (Bowl #2) directly in the pot and whisk constantly so the eggs don’t become scrambled eggs. This method is called bain marie (or water bath), where the bowl of food is set directly in a larger container of hot or simmering water. You can also use the double boiler method, where you set the egg mixture bowl (Bowl #2) over the Pot B. The bowl doesn’t touch the simmering water of the pot. In both cases, the water tempers the heat to permit gentle, even cooking.
Whisk until the temperature of the egg mixture reaches 104ºF (40ºC). Remove Bowl #2 from Pot B and set it up on the stand mixer with the whisk attachment.
Whisk on high speed (level 10) until the mixture is fluffy, for about 2 minutes. The batter should be loose yet thick and glossy.
When the batter is pale and fluffy and tripled in volume, slow down to low speed (level 4) for several seconds. Stop and lift up some of the mixture and fold it in, and if the batter stays on top of the mixture, that’s “ribbon stage” (see Notes). Remove from the stand mixer.
Add half of the flour. Using the whisk, fold gently but thoroughly. Do this by rotating your bowl slowly, and simultaneously moving your whisk in a downward-then-over motion.
Add the rest of the flour and fold gently to make sure all the flour is incorporated quickly so your mixture doesn’t deflate.
Take out 1 (spatula) scoop of the batter from the bowl and add to the butter & milk mixture.
Mix very well. We incorporate butter into batter first because fat in butter will deflate the batter if we add the butter directly.
Add the mixture back to the batter by pouring over the silicon spatula. This prevents the mixture from deflating the batter and helps disperse the mixture. Gently fold in. When you lift the spatula, the batter should fold down like ribbon.
Pour the batter into the center of the cake pan, from right above the cake pan. You want to avoid introducing extra air into the batter at this point. Collect the leftover batter in the bowl and pour around the edges of the cake pan, not the center.
Drop the cake pan on the counter to release air bubbles in the batter.
In the preheated oven, bake at 350ºF (180ºC) for 20-25 minutes. Check if the sponge cake is done by inserting a skewer in the middle and comes out clean. Meanwhile, move on to the cake assemble prepping stage.
As soon as you take out the cake pan from the oven, drop it on the counter to give shock to the cake (so it stops shrinking). Separate the cake from the pan by running a sharp knife or offset spatula around the pan.
Take the cake out of the pan by placing the wire rack on top and flipping it over.
Immediately remove the parchment paper.
Place another wire rack on top and flip it back. The top of the cake is now facing up.
Cover the cake with a damp towel until cooled (to keep moisture in the cake). Make sure the towel is thin (not heavy) and squeeze the water out VERY tightly so that it’s damp, not wet. I use IKEA’s thin dish towel. If you keep the sponge cake for later use, wrap with plastic wrap and keep it in the fridge (See Notes).
Preparation for cake assembly (while the cake is baking)
Divide the strawberries into 2 groups, for decoration and for filling. Keep the beautiful, same-sized strawberries for the decoration. Remove the husk and clean the strawberries with damp paper towel (do not wash, as we don’t want strawberries to have moisture and become moldy). Slice off the core for all the strawberries.
For the strawberries that we use for topping, cut in half. For the strawberries that we use for filling, slice them into ¼ inch (5 mm) slices.
To make syrup, in a small bowl (Bowl #3), combine 30 ml (2 Tbsp) water, 38 g (3 Tbsp) sugar, 1 Tbsp. liquor, and microwave for 1 minute to dissolve the sugar.
For whipping cream (while cake is cooling)
Prepare ice bath by placing ice cubes and water in a large bowl (Bowl #4). Place a clean and dry mixing bowl (Bowl #2) over and add 473 ml (1 Pint) heavy cream and 38 g (3 Tbsp) sugar to keep cool.
Once cooled, transfer the mixing bowl to the stand mixer and whisk on high speed. The cream will become thicker and smooth. When you lift the whisk out of the cream while it’s still liquid, but holds it shape as it drops, then it’s ready. Remove the bowl from the stand mixer and put it back in the ice bath.
The cake assembly
With a serrated knife, slice the middle of the cake horizontally into half. Now you have 2 layers (top and bottom).
Place the bottom of the cake on the cake circle. Brush the syrup on top and the sides of the bottom layer. This will keep the sponge cake stay moist.
Start to whisk the cream at one location by the edge of the bowl instead of whisking the entire cream. We will be making the whipped cream as we need. With this approach, we can also control the hardness of the cream.
When the cream reaches “soft peaks”, take out the cream and transfer to the bottom of the cake. Soft peaks means when you lift the whisk, the cream will hold its line but the top peaks will be soft and after a second or two will fall back on itself.
Spread the whipped cream evenly. If the whipped cream is not enough, whip more and add onto the cake.
Place the strawberries on top of the whipped cream as you see in the pictures. Keep the center area open by not covering with strawberries. This will be easier to cut the cake into slices.
Whip the cream again at the edge of the bowl.
Transfer the whipped cream to the top of the strawberry layer. Spread just enough cream to cover the strawberries, do not put too much.
Place the top layer of the sponge cake. Brush the syrup on the top and sides of the sponge cake.
Whip more cream and place on the top.
Place the tip of the offset spatula in the center at 30 degree angle, turn cake turntable toward you to create a smooth top. Lightly cover the sides of the cake with thin layer of the cream.
Now add more cream to the side little by little. Place the offset spatula at 90 degree angle and push the turning table away from you.
Remove the excess cream from the cake and put back into the bowl.
For cake decoration
For a basic decoration, I use Wilton 2A decoration tip. Put the tip in the piping bag and cut off the tip so the metal will show from the bag. Fold the top half of the bag outward as you see in the picture (over the hands).
Whip the cream to “stiff peaks”. When you lift the whisk, the peaks will hold firm. Put the cream into the piping bag. Once you fill out the bag half way, lift the bag and push the cream down to the tip.
Squeeze the pipe to test to make sure the cream comes out smoothly. When you’re ready, hold the piping bag at 90 degree angle and squeeze about 1 inch diameter of whipped cream around the edge of the cake. This will be the base for the strawberries.
Decorate and place the strawberries sideways on top of the whipped cream. Then squeeze more whipped cream in between strawberries, dropping small whipped cream all around. Place blueberries between the whipped cream dollops. Place the small mint leaves in some area to add colors.

In a large bowl, combine 1 large egg and ⅓ cup black sugar, and whisk together until sugar has dissolved.
Add 1 tsp oil and whisk together.
Sift 1 cup cake flour, 1 tsp baking powder, and ⅛ tsp kosher salt over the egg and sugar mixture.
Using a silicone spatula, start to combine the dry and wet ingredients. If the dough is too wet, you can add extra flour. Moisture in the air effects, so you have to decide how your dough is like. If you feel that it’s too soft and wet, add more flour 1 Tbsp at a time. The consistency is similar to cookie dough, but slightly softer. Let the dough rest for an hour.
Bring the oil in the deep fryer to 300-320ºF (150-160ºC) over medium-low heat. In order to cook inside the dough, we deep fry at low temperature. For a medium saucepan, you will need about 3 cups of oil. You can use less oil, but you will need to rotate the balls often as they won’t be covered by oil.
Prepare some oil (for rolling the dough) in a small bowl and rub it on your palms which will prevent the dough from sticking to your hands.
When the oil in the deep fryer reaches 300-320ºF (150-160ºC), scoop the dough with a cookie scooper and roll into a ball. To achieve the same portion size for whatever you're making, a cookie scooper is a great tool to have. The size should be slightly bigger than 1 inch (should be around 3 cm). We say the size should be Ping-Pong ball size (if that helps).
As soon as you are done with rolling, start putting the dough balls into the oil. They will expand so do not put too many.
Once the dough balls are cooked through, they start to float. They rotate themselves, but you can help them rotate to achieve even coloring.
When golden brown, about 7-8 minutes of deep frying, pick them up and drain excess oil on a paper towel or wire rack. Let cool for 5 minutes and enjoy!

Sift 1 ½ Tbsp green tea powder into a medium bowl. If you have a Chasen (bamboo tea whisk), you can whisk the sieve so there will be no green tea powder left inside. Set aside.
If you are using gelatin sheets, cut 2 gelatin sheets into thin ½ inch (1.3 cm) strips in a medium bowl. Please make sure to use a heat resistant bowl as we will need to melt the gelatin with a double boiler (Step 2). If you are using gelatin powder, put 5 g gelatin powder in a medium bowl. Once the gelatin sheet/powder is in the bowl, pour 2 Tbsp hot water and mix.
In a small saucepan, bring roughly ½ cup of water to simmer and place the bowl of gelatin mixture over the saucepan. The steam will immediately warm up the glass bowl and start dissolving the gelatin. Once dissolved, remove from the heat and set aside.
Pour 1 ¼ cup (300 ml) whole milk in a small saucepan and bring it to almost boil. When you see the small bubbles around the edge of the saucepan, turn off the heat.
Add ¼ cup (4 Tbsp, 50 g) granulated sugar and whisk well to dissolve the sugar.
Add 3 Tbsp of milk mixture into the green tea powder. Whisk with Chasen (or small whisk) until the mixture is silky smooth and you don’t see any lumps of dry green tea powder left (very important!).
Pour the green tea mixture into the milk mixture and whisk all together. If you dissolved all the powder at previous step, this step should be very easy and matcha powder should blend very well and easily.
Add the gelatin liquid into the green tea mixture and whisk well.
Put 3 Tbsp (40 g) anko (red bean paste) in a medium bowl and pour some of green tea mixture into red bean paste. Combine well. The green tea mixture will loosen up the red bean paste. Divide the red bean & green tea mixture into each serving cup.

My ice cream maker does not require freezing the bowl in advance but I need to run it for 15-20 minutes prior to making ice cream.

Finely chop ⅓-½ cup (40-60 g) raw walnuts and set aside.
Place the almonds in a single layer on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Almonds should be over an area measuring about 10"" x 7"" (25 x 18 cm). Optionally you could bake the almonds in the preheated oven at 300ºF (150ºC) for 10-15 minutes to bring out more flavors.
In a heavy 2-quart saucepan, add 1 cup (227 g) unsalted butter, 1 cup (200 g) granulated sugar, ¼ tsp kosher salt, and ½ tsp vanilla extract.
Cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally while with a clean, dry wooden spoon until butter is melted.
Once the butter is melted, set the timer for 5 minutes and continue cooking and stirring constantly until the toffee is the color of whole raw almonds. Depends on your heat, you will be stirring from 5 to 7 minutes (workout time!). If you use lower heat, it could take up to 10 minutes (hence I recommend a long wooden spoon so you can use stronger heat).
When the candy is color of raw almonds, turn off the heat.
Immediately pour the toffee over almonds, covering all nuts and smoothing into an even layer. Do not scrape the pan. Keep the pot for delicious hot caramel milk.
Melt 1 cup (170 g) semi-sweet or bittersweet chocolate chips over a double boiler until the chocolate is soft enough to stir smoothly. Alternatively, you can melt the chocolate in the microwave for about 1 to 1.5 minute to start with. Remove from the microwave and stir. Repeat heating at shorter intervals, 15 to 20 seconds, stirring in between, until the chocolate is completely melted and has a smooth consistency.
Spread the chocolate over cooled toffee.
Sprinkle with walnuts and let cool until chocolate is firm, about 2 hours (or once the toffee is cool down, refrigerate for 20 minutes to speed up the process).
Once set, cut with a sharp knife or break into bite-size pieces.

I've used a kitchen scale to measure my flours. Prepare 24 sheets of 4” x 4” (10 x 10 cm) parchment paper.
Melt the butter in the microwave or in a saucepan over the stove and let cool slightly. Crack 2 eggs in a bowl and beat them with a whisk. Set aside.
In the bowl of a stand mixer (or a large mixing bowl), combine whole milk (110ºF or 43ºC - slightly warmer than body temperature) and instant yeast, and then add ½ tsp sugar from the 50 g (¼ cup) sugar you prepared. Whisk the mixture well. Set aside for 5-10 minutes. NOTE: If you wonder why I hydrated instant yeast (even though it’s not Active Dry Yeast), please read the post.
Prepare a large mixing bowl and sift the tapioca flour and all-purpose flour through a fine-mesh sieve. Whisk to combine.
Set the stand mixer with a flat beater attachment. Add the rest of the sugar and beaten egg to the milk mixture.
Add the melted butter and vanilla.
Beat on low speed for 1 minute until combined (Or, stir with a wooden spoon).
Add roughly 2 cups flour mixture and beat on low speed until well combined.
With the stand mixer running on low speed, add the remaining flour mixture one scoop at a time and salt. Set aside the mixing bowl that flours were in for the next step. The dough mixture has thickened.
Now change to medium-high speed (Speed 6) and beat for 3-4 minutes, or until smooth and elastic. Note that this is a sticky dough, so do not add additional flours. Tip: Kneading develops the structure of the dough by folding and stretching strands of gluten. Hand Kneading: Because of the nature of this dough, it’s hard to knead the dough by hand. You can add 1-2 tablespoons of flour if it’s too wet to handle, but do not add any more flour than that. Hand-knead for 5-6 minutes.
Now bring back the large mixing bowl (that had flours in it earlier). Add a little bit of oil and grease it with a paper towel.
When you remove the flat beater from the stand mixer, you can see the stretchy, sticky dough.
Using the pastry card, transfer the dough into the greased bowl. Try to scrape down the dough from the sides, collect the dough into one big mass, then gently scrape it down to the greased bowl. The key here is to make sure the surface of the dough is mostly smooth (so that it will rise nicely). Loosely cover the bowl with plastic wrap (or a shower cap) and place it in a warm environment to rise until doubled, about 70-80 minutes. I use my “Proof” oven setting at 100ºF (38ºC). I put warm/hot water (away from the dough) to keep the inside of the oven moist. Tip: Make sure the proof temperature is not too high. If the dough gets too warm, it will ferment too quickly (or over ferment) and impair the flavor.
After 70-80 minutes, pour the oil into the Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot (See Notes for the amount of oil). If you have a thermometer, set up. I used Thermowork’s ChefAlarm. A probe clip attaches the probe right to the side of the dutch oven holding it securely in place, keeping it from flopping it around. Set your alarm thermometer to 325ºF (168ºC) as the lowest and 350ºF (177ºC) as the highest.
In a medium bowl, combine all the glaze ingredients except for matcha powder. Whisk really well to make sure there are no lumps of confectioners’ sugar. Keep the matcha powder on the side for now.
The picture below shows the dough doubled in size, after 75 minutes of proofing.
Prepare 1-2 Tbsp of all-purpose flour and put it at the corner of your work surface. Lightly flour the work surface and your hands.
Using the pastry card, remove the dough from the bowl and transfer to the lightly floured surface. Sprinkle some flour on top of the dough and press the dough down with your hands to release any air bubbles.
With the pastry card, shape the dough into a rough log shape and cut it in half.
Shape the half into a ball and cover with plastic wrap. Cut the other half into 4 pieces, and roll them into 4 balls. Keep 3 dough balls under the plastic wrap.
Each dough balls will make roughly 3 Pon de Ring donuts. Using the pastry card, cut the dough into small balls. Each ball size should be ½ - ¾ inches (1.5 cm) in length and width. Or if you have a digital kitchen scale, each ball should be 5 grams.
Roll the ball between your hands, but try not to spend too much time. Over-kneaded dough often ends up with hard crust and a dense, dry interior. Since the dough is very sticky, this pastry card is very helpful.
Use the pastry card to transfer each ball to a 4” x 4” parchment paper. You will need 8 balls to make a Pon de Ring shape.
The total weight of Pon de Ring should be roughly 40 grams (5 g each ball).
Continue with the rest of the dough.
To make sure the balls won’t separate in the hot oil, use a pastry brush to dab water on the dough where balls attach to neighboring ones. Cover the donuts with a damp paper towel or light cloth (make sure it’s not heavy) and allow to rest for 15-20 minutes. Continue with the rest of the dough. If you are taking a very long time, it’s very helpful to work with a partner so the dough won’t be over-proofed.
When you’re finishing up with the last batch of dough, start heating the oil in the Dutch oven to 350ºF (177ºC). Prepare the first baking sheet lined with a paper towel and a second baking sheet lined with parchment paper and put a wire rack on top.
Using your hands or fine-mesh skimmer (a kind that has a flat mesh), submerge the donut into the oil.
Let go of the donut and set the timer for 1 minute 15 seconds for the first side. Tip: Only add enough donuts for a 5-10 degree drop in temperature (I only add 2 donuts per batch). If the oil cools down too much, the donuts won’t fry properly.
When the 1 minute 15 seconds timer beeps, flip the donuts quickly using chopsticks or tongs. Fry the second side for 45 seconds.
When the 45-second timer beeps, scoop up the donut and drain well. Then transfer to the paper towel to drain excess oil. Repeat with remaining donuts, then turn off the heat.
While the donuts are still hot, dip each donut into the glaze, making sure to coat well.
Place it onto the prepared rack to allow excess glaze to drip down. The glaze will set and harden on the donuts after 30 minutes.
After making 12 glazed donuts, you can add the matcha to the leftover glaze. Whisk really well to combine.
Dip each donut into the matcha glaze, making sure to coat well. Place it onto the rack to allow excess glaze to drip down. The glaze will set and harden on the donuts after 30 minutes
Just like any other deep-fried foods, it’s best to eat the donuts when they are warm. Enjoy!

Preheat the oven to 375ºF (190ºC). For a convection oven, reduce cooking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC).
Wash the sweet potatoes carefully (the skin is edible and very nutritious) under running water. Pat dry with paper towel.
Wrap each sweet potato with a sheet of aluminum foil. Poke a few holes with a skewer (for steam to escape).
Put the sweet potatoes in the oven and bake for 50-60 minutes, or until the inserted skewer goes through all the way.
Carefully open the aluminum foil and cut the sweet potato in half lengthwise. Make sure not to tear the skin.
While it’s hot, using a spoon, scoop out the flesh leaving a 5 mm (¼ inch) wall around the edges to create a shell. We use the shells to stuff the sweet potato puree later on, so be careful not to break the wall. You will only use 5 best-looking shells out of 6.
Transfer the sweet potato flesh onto the fine-mesh sieve and strain the flesh by pressing it with a wooden spatula. Alternatively, you can put the flesh in a food processor and make a puree (you may need to add a tiny bit of water if the sweet potato flesh is too dense).
Continue with the rest of the sweet potatoes. Collect the strained pureed sweet potato in a bowl.
In a medium saucepan, heat 2 Tbsp unsalted butter over medium-low heat. Once the butter is completely melted, add the pureed sweet potato.
Add 5 Tbsp sugar and mix well together.
Then add egg yolks one at a time and quickly incorporate into the sweet potato mixture so the egg doesn’t become scrambled egg. Keep stirring.
Gradually add ⅓ cup heavy cream, stirring continuously, and combine well with the mixture.
Add ½ tsp vanilla extract and mix until the mixture is smooth and creamy. If the mixture turns into a big lump and not the silky texture, you can add more melted butter and/or heavy cream to loosen up. Turn off the heat.
Scoop the mixture into the sweet potato shells. I use a cookie dough scooper to make the job easier (this is great for portion control, too!).
Using a offset spatula (or a silicone spatula), smooth out the surface of the filling, creating a gentle slope in the center of the sweet potatoes.
Place the sweet potato shells on a baking sheet lined with a sheet of parchment paper.

Preheat the oven to 340ºF (170ºC). For a convection oven, reduce cooking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC0. You will also need a 17cm (7"") chiffon cake pan. If you have a different size chiffon cake pan, please read this post. Make sure you use the correct chiffon cake pan. The best types are the aluminum ones with a removable base (Do not use non-stick bakeware for chiffon cake – it will not work). Do not grease the mold because the cake needs to cling on the sides and center of the pan for support as it rises or it will collapse.
Put 2 tsp Earl Grey loose tea leaves in a food processor (I used a Nutribullet here) and grind them to fine powder. Alternatively, you can use a mortar and pestle to grind tea leaves, or put tea leaves in a bag and crush them.
Put 1 Tbsp. Earl Grey loose tea leaves in a fine sieve over a bowl and pour 6 Tbsp (90 ml) of hot water to seep a strong tea. After cooling down, remove the tea leaves and use ONLY 4 Tbsp (60 ml) Earl Grey tea and set aside.
Separate 3 eggs to whites and yolks. Keep the egg whites in the refrigerator (or freezer) until you're ready to use.
In a large bowl, whisk 3 egg yolks and roughly ⅓ of 85 g sugar.
Add 3 Tbsp vegetable oil, 4 Tbsp tea, and whisk all together until combined.
Add the powdered Earl Grey tea in the egg mixture and mix well.
Sift 75 g cake flour and 1 tsp baking powder into the egg mixture in 3 increments. Whisk until totally incorporated and make sure there are no lumps.
Using a stand mixer (make sure there is no trace of water or oil), whip the chilled egg whites on medium-low sped (speed 4) till opaque, foamy and bubbly. If you put the egg whites in the freezer, the surface and edges may be frozen already, but that's okay. You can add half-frozen egg whites into the bowl. Add ⅓ of the remaining sugar and continue whipping. After 30 seconds or so, increase the stand mixer speed to high (speed 10) and add the remaining sugar slowly in small increments. It takes about 2-3 minutes until stiff peaks form (from the moment you switched to speed 10, but this is just a rough guide and it will vary based on stand mixers.). To check on stiff peaks, pull up your whisk and see if the egg whites go straight up (stiff peak) and just the tip is soft enough that it folds over, like taking a bow.
Using a spatula, fold in ⅓ of the egg whites to the batter until the mixture is homogeneous.
Fold in the rest of egg whites in 2-3 increments and mix gently until the mixture is homogeneous.
Pour the batter into the ungreased 17 cm (7”) chiffon cake pan in same location to prevent from foaming more bubbles. To remove or prevent air pockets before baking, run a skewer (chopstick, knife or spatula) through the batter and then drop gently a few times.
Bake in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean and the top of the cake springs back when gently pressed. If the top gets burn too quickly, cover the top loosely with aluminum foil.
The cake must be cooled upside down in its pan so that it stretch down instead of collapsing. Stick the cake pan on a tall heavy bottle or invert the cake pan onto a cooling rack (if you use angel food cake pan). Let it cool completely. To extract the cake, run a thin sharp knife or thin offset spatula around both the outer and inner edge of the cake and then tap the cake out onto a serving plate.

Steam Kabocha in Instant Pot
Quickly rinse the kabocha under water and remove the seeds with a spoon.
Cut kabocha into wedges and then 2 inch pieces.
Fill the Instant Pot with 1 cup water and set a steamer basket inside.
Put the kabocha in a single layer.
Close the lid and set HIGH pressure for 2 minutes.
Make sure the steam release handle points at “sealing” and not “venting”. The float valve goes up when pressurized.
Make Caramel Sauce
While you’re waiting for Kabocha to finish (Keep in mind that after pressure cooking, you only let the pressure release naturally for 10 minutes), we can make the caramel sauce. Boil water in a kettle or saucepan and set aside (you will only need 2 Tbsp hot water). Put 4 Tbsp sugar and 1 Tbsp water in a small saucepan.
Gently shake the saucepan to evenly distribute sugar and do not touch until the mixture starts to turn golden brown. Gently shake the pan again to distribute the mixture to have even color.
When the caramel reaches amber color (I like a slightly darker color – which has a milder bitter), turn off the heat and quickly add 2 Tbsp hot water to loosen it. The caramel will splash, so use a lid to protect yourself from getting caramel splatter.
Swirl the saucepan to make even mixture and pour the caramel into 4 ramekins. Allow the caramel sauce to cool.
Make Kabocha Puree
When it’s finished cooking, the Instant Pot will switch automatically to the “Keep Warm” mode. Let the pressure release naturally for 10 minutes and then proceed with quick release (DO NOT EXCEED. I recommend to set a timer.) by turning the steam release handle to the “venting” position to let steam out until the float valve drops down. Hold a kitchen towel and do not place your hand or face over steam release valve. The steam should be left only a little bit after 10 minutes of natural release.
Open the lid and remove the steam rack from the Instant Pot.
Use a knife or spoon to remove the flesh. Discard the kabocha skin (but it’s edible!).
Use a flour sifter or fine mesh sieve (Uragoshiki in Japanese) or a food processor. Set the fine mesh sieve over a sheet of parchment paper and press the steamed kabocha into the mesh with a wooden spatula. Once it’s all done, flip the mesh sieve and take out the pureed kabocha onto the parchment paper. If you’re using a food processor, process the kabocha into a puree.
Measure ½ cup (120 g) kabocha puree from the pile. With almost 1 lb kabocha, you will have enough to make 4 ramekins, but you may not have enough puree for another batch. It’s hard to predict the real weight of kabocha with seeds included, so please adjust accordingly. You can also save the puree for up to 3 days in the fridge. I sometimes make Kabocha Soup with the leftover puree.
Make Custard Mixture
In a large bowl, combine 3 eggs and 3 Tbsp sugar and whisk well.
Add ½ cup milk, ½ cup heavy cream, and 1 tsp vanilla extract, and whisk to combine.
Add the kabocha puree and mix until thoroughly combined.
For the best texture, set a fine-mesh sieve over a large bowl (I use a 4-cup liquid measuring cup) and pass the custard mixture through the sieve. If you have a smaller fine mesh strainer, you can directly pour over the ramekins.
Divide the custard mixture into 4 ramekins.
Cover each ramekin tightly with a sheet of aluminum foil.
Pressure Cook
Add 1 cup water into the Instant Pot and place the steam rack inside.
Put the 4 ramekins on the rack and make sure they are not tilted.
Close the lid and set HIGH pressure for 6 minutes. Make sure the steam release handle points at “sealing” and not “venting”.
When it’s finished cooking, the Instant Pot will switch automatically to the “Keep Warm” mode. Let the pressure release naturally for 10 minutes and then proceed with quick release (DO NOT EXCEED. I recommend to set a timer.) by turning the steam release handle to the “venting” position to let steam out until the float valve drops down. Hold a kitchen towel and do not place your hand or face over steam release valve. The steam should be left only a little bit after 10 minutes of natural release.
Take out one ramekin and remove aluminum foil. Insert a skewer in the center of the flan to see if the custard is set and no liquid comes out. If it’s not cooked through, repeat the pressure cooking process (the cooking time varies depending on your result).
Let cool on the counter until the flan is room temperature. Then put the ramekins on a tray, cover with paper towel (to absorb condensation/moisture) and plastic, and transfer to the refrigerator to chill for at least 2 hours, or preferably overnight.
To Serve
Run a knife around the ramekins.
Hold the ramekin and plate together and shake vigorously a few times to invert onto a plate. Enjoy!

Next, melt the 20g of butter in a large frying pan and add in the chopped pears and 20g of Caster Sugar. Cook through for a couple of minutes until the pear juice starts to form a nice syrup with the sugar. At this point, pour in the brandy and allow to sizzle vigorously for a couple of seconds before setting it alight with a lighter or match. Allow to burn out, shaking the pan every few seconds.
Melt the remaining 30g of butter for the purses either in a pan or placing in the microwave on high power for a few seconds. Cut the filo pastry sheets in half width-ways, so you get 6 pieces. Layer them on top of each other, brushing the top of each bottom sheet with butter before placing a new sheet on top. Once all three sheets are in place, brush the top again with butter.
Preheat your oven to 220 degrees Celsius and meanwhile place half of the cooked pear mixture into the centre of the pastry sheets. Bring the corners together and press gently at the top to form a small pouch or bag shape. Brush liberally again with butter and place onto a lightly greased baking sheet. Repeat the process again for the second purse and then place into the preheated oven and bake for 15-20 minutes until a rich golden brown.
While the purses are baking place the sugar for the caramel sauce into a pan and melt over a medium heat, stirring all the time. When the sugar has completely melted down to a rich, brown sauce add in the cream. At this point the sauce will froth up a lot so watch out and stir well. When the bubbling has subsided add in the butter and stir until melted. Set aside and allow to cool.
Next, melt the chocolate in another pan over medium heat, stirring all the time until completely melted. When ready, pour in the cream and stir well to blend.

Instant Pot Kabocha Flan,Namiko Chen,https://www.justonecookbook.com/instant-pot-kabocha-flan/,Japanese,https://www.justonecookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Instant-Pot-Kabocha-Flan-I-1.jpg,"['3 large eggs (50 g each w/o shell)', '½ cup milk', '½ cup heavy (whipping) cream', '1 tsp pure vanilla extract', '3 Tbsp sugar', '15 oz kabocha (squash/pumpkin) ((with seeds))', '4 Tbsp sugar', '1 Tbsp water', '2 Tbsp hot water']","Gather all the ingredients.
Steam Kabocha in Instant Pot
Quickly rinse the kabocha under water and remove the seeds with a spoon.
Cut kabocha into wedges and then 2 inch pieces.
Fill the Instant Pot with 1 cup water and set a steamer basket inside.
Put the kabocha in a single layer.
Close the lid and set HIGH pressure for 2 minutes.
Make sure the steam release handle points at “sealing” and not “venting”. The float valve goes up when pressurized.
Make Caramel Sauce
While you’re waiting for Kabocha to finish (Keep in mind that after pressure cooking, you only let the pressure release naturally for 10 minutes), we can make the caramel sauce. Boil water in a kettle or saucepan and set aside (you will only need 2 Tbsp hot water). Put 4 Tbsp sugar and 1 Tbsp water in a small saucepan.
Gently shake the saucepan to evenly distribute sugar and do not touch until the mixture starts to turn golden brown. Gently shake the pan again to distribute the mixture to have even color.
When the caramel reaches amber color (I like a slightly darker color – which has a milder bitter), turn off the heat and quickly add 2 Tbsp hot water to loosen it. The caramel will splash, so use a lid to protect yourself from getting caramel splatter.
Swirl the saucepan to make even mixture and pour the caramel into 4 ramekins. Allow the caramel sauce to cool.
Make Kabocha Puree
When it’s finished cooking, the Instant Pot will switch automatically to the “Keep Warm” mode. Let the pressure release naturally for 10 minutes and then proceed with quick release (DO NOT EXCEED. I recommend to set a timer.) by turning the steam release handle to the “venting” position to let steam out until the float valve drops down. Hold a kitchen towel and do not place your hand or face over steam release valve. The steam should be left only a little bit after 10 minutes of natural release.
Open the lid and remove the steam rack from the Instant Pot.
Use a knife or spoon to remove the flesh. Discard the kabocha skin (but it’s edible!).
Use a flour sifter or fine mesh sieve (Uragoshiki in Japanese) or a food processor. Set the fine mesh sieve over a sheet of parchment paper and press the steamed kabocha into the mesh with a wooden spatula. Once it’s all done, flip the mesh sieve and take out the pureed kabocha onto the parchment paper. If you’re using a food processor, process the kabocha into a puree.
Measure ½ cup (120 g) kabocha puree from the pile. With almost 1 lb kabocha, you will have enough to make 4 ramekins, but you may not have enough puree for another batch. It’s hard to predict the real weight of kabocha with seeds included, so please adjust accordingly. You can also save the puree for up to 3 days in the fridge. I sometimes make Kabocha Soup with the leftover puree.
Make Custard Mixture
In a large bowl, combine 3 eggs and 3 Tbsp sugar and whisk well.
Add ½ cup milk, ½ cup heavy cream, and 1 tsp vanilla extract, and whisk to combine.
Add the kabocha puree and mix until thoroughly combined.
For the best texture, set a fine-mesh sieve over a large bowl (I use a 4-cup liquid measuring cup) and pass the custard mixture through the sieve. If you have a smaller fine mesh strainer, you can directly pour over the ramekins.
Divide the custard mixture into 4 ramekins.
Cover each ramekin tightly with a sheet of aluminum foil.
Pressure Cook
Add 1 cup water into the Instant Pot and place the steam rack inside.
Put the 4 ramekins on the rack and make sure they are not tilted.
Close the lid and set HIGH pressure for 6 minutes. Make sure the steam release handle points at “sealing” and not “venting”.
When it’s finished cooking, the Instant Pot will switch automatically to the “Keep Warm” mode. Let the pressure release naturally for 10 minutes and then proceed with quick release (DO NOT EXCEED. I recommend to set a timer.) by turning the steam release handle to the “venting” position to let steam out until the float valve drops down. Hold a kitchen towel and do not place your hand or face over steam release valve. The steam should be left only a little bit after 10 minutes of natural release.
Take out one ramekin and remove aluminum foil. Insert a skewer in the center of the flan to see if the custard is set and no liquid comes out. If it’s not cooked through, repeat the pressure cooking process (the cooking time varies depending on your result).
Let cool on the counter until the flan is room temperature. Then put the ramekins on a tray, cover with paper towel (to absorb condensation/moisture) and plastic, and transfer to the refrigerator to chill for at least 2 hours, or preferably overnight.
To Serve
Run a knife around the ramekins.
Hold the ramekin and plate together and shake vigorously a few times to invert onto a plate. Enjoy!

Rinse azuki beans and discard broken ones.
Transfer the drained azuki beans to a large pot. Add water till 1-2 inches above azuki beans. Turn the heat on high.
Bring the water to boil over medium high heat.
Once boiling, discard the water and put the azuki beans back into the same pot.
Add water till 1-2 inches above azuki beans.
Bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat. Once boiling, put an otoshibuta (drop lid) over the azuki beans (Otoshibuta will prevent the beans from dancing around too much). Turn down the heat to medium-low and keep it simmering for the next 1 to 1.5 hours.
Water will evaporate so you need to keep adding water so the beans are submerged. After 1 hour, pick one bean and mash it with your fingers. If it is mashed easily, it's done.
To Make Tsubuan (Chunky Red Bean Paste)
Drain the azuki beans over a sieve.
Put the beans in the same pot. Turn the heat to medium-low heat and add half of the sugar.
Mix well with the azuki beans. Once sugar is dissolved, add the rest of the sugar.
Mix, stirring constantly and add the salt.
If you plan to use red bean for Zenzai (Oshiruko), you can use it right away. If you prefer a thicker version, reduce the soup.
Let the moisture evaporate. When you can draw a line on the bottom of the pot, turn off the heat. Don't worry if it's still loose; Anko will continue to thicken as it cools. Transfer to a flat baking sheet to let cool completely. Tsubuan is ready to use. Scroll down to see how to store it.
To Make Koshian (Fine Red Bean Paste)
Drain the azuki beans over a sieve, reserving some cooking liquid.
Transfer the beans to a food processor. Add 1-2 Tbsp cooking liquid if necessary and run the food processor until the beans become a fine paste.
Transfer the fine paste back into the same pot. Turn the heat to medium-low heat and add half of the sugar.
Mix well with the bean paste. Once sugar is dissolved, add the rest of the sugar.

I shared more detailed info in the post, so please visit the blog post of this recipe.
Prepare Cake Pan
Cut parchment paper for the bottom and side of cake pan. You will need a 9” (23 cm) round paper for the bottom, one 4” x 30” (10 x 76 cm) paper for the side of cake pan, and two 2” x 30” (5 x 76 cm) paper strips which will be used for “transporting”.
Grease the cake pan and parchment paper (for bottom and sides) with butter (15 g). You don't need to use all of it.
Place the 2 “straps” criss-cross on the bottom of the cake pan. Then place the bottom and side parchment paper. The grease side of the 9” (23 cm) paper should face up, and face in on the 4” x 30” (10 x 76 cm) paper.
Preheat the Oven & Gather Ingredients
Preheat the oven to 350ºF (180ºC). You will be baking at 320ºF (160ºC) but when you open the oven to place the cheesecake you’ll lose some heat, so we’ll start off a bit higher.
Please note that it is very important that ingredients are all measured before starting. Separate the 6 eggs into egg yolks and egg whites. Refrigerate the egg whites.
Mix over Double Boiler
Set a medium saucepan filled with 2” (5 cm) water and bring to simmer. Add cream cheese (300 g), unsalted butter (60 g), heavy whipping cream (200 ml), and granulated sugar (60 g) in a large bowl. Put the bowl over the saucepan.
Using a silicone spatula, mash the cream cheese and butter. Once they are melted, use whisk to blend everything together. Remove from the heat.
Mix at the Counter
In the warm cream cheese mixture add 6 egg yolks, one yolk at a time while whisking. Make sure each egg yolk blended well with the mixing before adding the next one.
Using a fine-mesh strainer, sift cake flour (80 g) into the batter. Whisk and blend together.
Then pass the batter through the same fine mesh strainer to a clean large bowl, creating the silky texture for the batter.
Zest half of a lemon into the batter. Make sure you only zest the yellow part, not the bitter white part. Then squeeze half lemon into a small bowl. Measure lemon juice (30 ml) and add to the batter. Whisk well to blend and set aside.
Set Up Bain-Marie
Put the baking sheet inside the oven and pour hot water until half way or 1 inch deep. Close the oven.
Beat Egg Whites
Add cold egg whites into a large clean mixing bowl (of the stand mixer). Make sure there is no oil or water in the bowl. If you have space in your refrigerator, I highly recommend keeping the mixing bowl cold until you’re ready to use it. Start whisking on medium speed (speed 4) until the egg whites become opaque, foamy, and bubbly, about 2 minutes. Then slowly add 100 g granulated sugar, ⅓ portion at a time while the mixer runs.
Once all the sugar has been added, increase the mixer speed to high (speed 8-9) and beat the egg whites until “soft” to “medium” peaks. When lift the whisk, the egg whites shouldn’t fold ribbons (drizzle) anymore. When you turn your whisk upside down, the egg whites should cling to the whisk and hold their shape for a few seconds, but then start to flop over.
Fold in Egg Whites
Using a whisk, mix in ⅓ of egg whites into the cream cheese mixture until incorporated. Then gently fold in another ⅓ into the mixture.
Lastly, pour the mixture back into the mixer bowl (with ⅓ of egg whites still in it) and fold in very gently.
Pour the mixture into the baking pan in all at once, avoiding air pockets while pouring. Tap the cake pan a few times on the kitchen counter to release any air pockets in the batter.
Bake the Cheesecake
Place the cake pan into the baking sheet that’s already in the oven. Reduce the oven temperature to 320ºF (160ºC) and start baking for 70-75 minutes. Then, reduce the oven temperature to 300ºF (150ºC) and bake for another 10 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the skewer inserted comes out clean. For a convection oven, reduce cooking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC).
Let Cool
Turn off the oven and leave the oven door ajar for 15-20 minutes with the cake inside. If you take the cake out immediately, the sudden change of temperature could cause the cake to shrink or collapse. You want the cake to slowly shrink down to half the height, roughly from 4 inches to 2 inches. Remove the pan from the oven. Gently pull out the cake using the 2 parchment paper straps (with another set of hand).
Remove the parchment paper around the cake (leave the bottom one). Combine apricot jam (2 Tbsp) and hot water (2 tsp) in a small bowl. Brush the apricot mixture over the top of the cheesecake. Let cool to room temperature.
To Serve
You can serve the cake at room temperature (fluffiest!) or chill the cake for 1-2 hours before serving.
To Store
You can store the cake in the refrigerator for up to 3-4 days or in the freezer for 3-4 weeks. Defrost the cake overnight in the refrigerator. The cold cheesecake is dense, so leave it at the counter till chilled/room temperature before serving.",en-US,{},4.68,,Just One Cookbook,170,1 serving(s)

Preheat the oven to 390F (200C).
For the ramekins: Brush the ramekins with butter, using upward strokes. Put 1 tsp. sugar in each ramekin and rotate the ramekin to dust the insides with sugar. Remove excess sugar from the ramekin and chill in refrigerator to set (This gives the souffles something to grip on to as the batter climbs up the sides of the ramekins during baking.).
For the custard: In a large bowl, beat the egg yolks and sugar together.
Sift the flour into the egg mixture and mix well.
Heat the milk and heavy cream in a small saucepan until almost boiling.
Add a splash of hot milk mixture into the egg mixture and whisk well until the mixture is smooth.
Then gradually whisk in the rest of the milk mixture.
Pour the mixture back into the saucepan. Whisk the mixture ALL TIMES over a medium-low heat for 3-4 minutes until thickened and smooth. KEEP WHISKING during this process otherwise your custard will overcook and become clumpy.
When the custard has thickened, immediately transfer to a bowl (otherwise remaining heat from the saucepan will “overcook” the mixture). Cover with plastic wrap and cool to room temperature for about 30 minutes (or you can put in the fridge to make this process faster).
Once the custard has cool down, sift matcha green tea powder into the custard.
For the meringue: Whisk the egg whites in a clean bowl till bubbles start to form (Kitchen Aid mixer Level 3 for 2 minutes).
Start adding sugar gradually a spoonful at a time. Once you add all the sugar, increase the speed to Level 8 and whisk to make a firm, glossy meringue, about 3-4 minutes.
Whisk ⅓ of the meringue into the custard and mix until homogenous.
Very carefully fold in the rest of the meringue using a rubber spatula. Do not over mix.
Divide the souffle mix into 4 ramekins. Tap them on the work surface to level the mixture and run the thumb around the edge.
Place the ramekins on a baking tray and bake for 12-15 minutes until well risen and slightly golden on top. The souffle should wobble gently in the middle when it’s ready.

To Preheat the Oven
Preheat the convection oven (with fan) to 450ºF (230ºC). If you don’t have an oven with fan, preheat the conventional oven to 475ºF (245ºC). If your oven doesn’t get hot very well, you can preheat to the hottest oven temperature (mine is 550ºF (290ºC)) for 30-60 minutes. As for the oven rack, I used the middle rack for the convection oven (the fan circulates the air, so the middle rack is ideal). If you use the conventional oven, move the rack slightly higher as heat rises and the top of the oven is higher temperature. However, keep in mind that a 3-inch deep cake pan needs extra space for rising.
To Prepare the Cake Pan
Line a 6-inch (15-cm) round cake pan with 2 large sheets of parchment paper. When you cut 2 sheets of parchment papers, leave at least 2 inches (5 cm) of overhang around all edges. Fold the parchment paper twice to find the center of the paper.
Overlap 2 sheets of parchment paper so the cross/center matches and place them over in the middle of the pan. Make sure the longer side is against each other. Place the removable bottom on top.
Press down the removable bottom and the parchment paper, creasing against the bottom of the cake pan to fit snugly in the pan. Press the paper around the cake pan too.
Gently take out the removable bottom and the parchment-paper “mold”. Place the removable bottom back into the cake pan (as it should be). Then place the parchment-paper “mold” into the cake pan. Press the paper down to fit perfectly.
To Make the Batter
Make sure the cream cheese is at room temperature. If not, microwave the cold cream cheese at half power (50%) for 45 seconds, or microwave at 15 seconds incremental.
Press down the cream cheese and make it soft. Then add sugar.
Combine cream cheese with sugar by rubbing the mixture with the spatula against the bowl. The cream cheese will become fluffy and smooth as the sugar granules disappear. Scrape both bowl and spatula often to ensure that nothing sticks to them and that there are no lumps.
Out of the 3 eggs, you will only need 2 whole eggs and 1 egg yolk. Whisk them well in a bowl.
Slowly and gradually add the beaten egg 2-3 separate times. Don’t add more egg until the batter is smooth and no lumps, blending COMPLETELY and THOROUGHLY.
Frequently scrape off the batter from the bowl and spatula and make sure there are no lumps in the batter.
Add the rest of the eggs and blend well.
Take out a small portion of the batter to a clean bowl. I transferred about 2 scoops of batter.
Sift the matcha a little bit at a time as you stir and blend together. Then sift more and continue as you finish sifting and blending in all the matcha.
Mix all together and if it’s too thick, add more batter.
Blend again until smooth (no lumps). I added another scoop of batter.
Now transfer the matcha batter back into the main batter.
Blend the two batters very well until it has a smooth consistency.
Next, sift the cake flour and cornstarch into the batter as you stir and blend together. Then sift more and continue as you finish sifting and blending in all the flour. Take your time to do this. You don’t want any lumps.
Gradually add heavy cream while you stir. Mix until it’s all combined. Add salt and blend together.
Pour the cake batter into the prepared pan in one go (avoid stop-and-go) so the air pockets don’t go in.
Tap the cake pan on the countertop a few times. With a bamboo skewer or toothpick, pop the air bubbles if there are any, and then run the batter with it to remove any bubbles.
To Bake
As a prevention, you can bake the cheesecake on a baking sheet, just in case it overflows. Mine never did, but I use it as it’s easier to transfer the cake pan from and to the oven. Transfer the cake pan to the oven and bake at 450ºF (230ºC) (or 475ºF (245ºC) if conventional oven) until the top is dark amber/brown and the center is still very jiggly, about 30 minutes (please keep an eye on your cheesecake because every oven is different). My top doesn’t start becoming dark until close to a 30-minute mark. If you love the “gooey/ oozy” texture and bake for a less amount of time than I provided, then you must chill before serving. NEVER overcook the cake by extending the bake time, even though the top doesn't turn dark. You can't fix it when the texture of the filling curdles from overcooking. You probably need to adjust the oven temperature (or oven rack or preheating time) next time you make it.
To Cool
Take out the cake when the surface is dark, burnt color. The cake should wobble when you gently shake the pan. Let the cheesecake cool in the pan on a wire rack until it reaches room temperature, about 2-3 hours. Don’t put it on the countertop directly and make sure the air can go through under the cake pan. You can place it on top of the stovetop, if it's is not in use.
To Chill
You can skip chilling and serve at room temperature (which we like, too). If you prefer to serve chilled cheesecake or a firmer cheesecake, place the cheesecake, covered in cloth (don’t use plastic, as condensation may drop onto the cake), in the refrigerator for 4 hours.
To Serve
Remove the cheesecake from the cake pan and carefully peel back the parchment paper. If you have chilled the cake, let stand at room temperature for at least 30 minutes or up to 2 hours before serving.

You can store the cheesecake in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.",en-US,"{'calories': '2216 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '128 g', 'proteinContent': '42 g', 'fatContent': '173 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '99 g', 'transFatContent': '1 g', 'cholesterolContent': '1107 mg', 'sodiumContent': '1103 mg', 'fiberContent': '1 g', 'sugarContent': '108 g', 'servingSize': '1 serving'}",4.63,,Just One Cookbook,300,1 serving(s)

You will need 1 whole package AND empty space of the second package.
Before you start prepping, remember to keep cream cheese, butter, egg yolks, and heavy cream at room temperature.
Preheat oven to 320F (160C) degree. Start boiling water.
Cut the parchment paper and lightly grease the bottom and sides of a 9"" (23 cm) spring-form pan with cooking spray.
Spread the oil (acts like a glue) throughout the pan and line with parchment paper.
Again lightly grease with cooking spray on the parchment paper and dust with flour.
Tap the cake pan to spread the flour on the bottom. Wrap the base of the cake pan with aluminum foil (preferably with extra-large heavy duty foil) to prevent seepage. If you use regular size aluminum foil, make sure to seal the two sheets of foil very tightly by folding two edges and make one big foil.
In the bowl of the electric mixer, beat blueberry cream cheese and sugar on medium-high speed until smooth.
Add the softened butter and mix until thoroughly incorporated.
Add the beaten egg yolk and heavy cream and mix well.
Add lemon juice and rum and mix until the batter is very smooth.
Add the flour all at once and mix well.
Transfer the batter to a large bowl. Wash the mixer bowl and dry completely. Make sure there is no oil or water in the bowl (IMPORTANT).
To make meringue, beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form. In the bowl of electric mixer, whip the egg whites on medium low speed (speed 4) till opaque and foamy and bubbly. Then add 1/4 of the sugar at a time as the mixer runs. Once all of the sugar has been added, increase the mixer speed to high (speed 10) and whip for approximately 4 minutes, until the meringue has doubled in volume and is thick and glossy.
To test for stiff peaks, the peaks should stand straight up when you lift up the beaters. The whites should not slide around. If the meringue has not reached the desired consistency, continue whipping at high speed for another 30 seconds, then stop and test again. Once the egg whites are over beaten, they can't be used for the recipe.
Add 1/3 of the meringue to the batter and mix well.
Then add the rest of the meringue all at once and fold it in (not mix this time).
Pour the batter in the cake pan and then drop the pan from 2-3"" (5-7 cm) high a few times onto the countertop to remove any air bubbles. Smooth out the surface.
Place the cake pan in a large roasting pan and pour 1"" (2.5 cm) of boiling water in the roasting pan. Place the baking pan in the middle rack of the oven. (The reason why we put hot water in the pan is that steam will help making cake soft and moist and hot water around the cake will gradually cook inside the cake while baking in the oven.)
Bake at 320F (160C) for 60 minutes or until light golden brown. Then reduce temperature to 300F (150C) and bake for another 30 minutes.
When a wooden skewer inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean without wet batter, turn off the oven. Let the cake sit in the oven with the door slightly ajar for 15 minutes. Remove from the oven, take out the cake pan from the roasting pan, and then let cool to room temperature on a wire rack. Refrigerate at least 4 hours or overnight.
For blueberry topping, bring blueberries and water to a boil in a medium saucepan, stirring occasionally. In a small bowl, whisk together 1 Tbsp. water and 1 Tbsp. corn starch until combined.

Put Yomogi in a bowl and add hot water. Use a fork to combine yomogi and water well.
Set aside for 5 minutes. Then strain the yomogi using a fine mesh strainer. Discard the liquid.
Combine joshinko, shiratamako, and sugar in a large bowl and mix all together.
Add hot water in small increments to combine (NEVER pour water at once). Mix well before you add more water. When the texture of the dough is similar to an earlobe texture, it’s good to go. It’s a funny comparison but that’s the traditional way to check the consistency. If you put too much water and your dough is too soft, add more joshinko.
Divide the dough into thirds. Add the red food coloring to one third, the yomogi to another third, and keep the last one as it is.
Knead each dough until the color is even and well combined.
Roll the dough into 8 even-sized balls for each color. I used a #60 cookie scooper that holds 2 tsp. I have to say it’s a bit bigger than the actual dango, so you can probably use 1 to 1.5 tsp. would be the ideal size. You might be able to get 12 dango total.
Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook the white dango in boiling water until they start floating, about 8 minutes. Stir in the beginning so the dango won't stick at the bottom. Once floating, cook for another 1 minute.
Remove the white dango from the water and immediately let them cool in iced water for 1 minute. Then transfer to a plate.
Next, work on the pink dango, and repeat the same process. Then finish with the green dango. As you see, the boiling water changes color, so I recommend starting from light to dark color so the white dango doesn’t get stained.
Put one of each color dango onto a skewer, in the order of green, white, and pink. Serve at room temperature.
To Store
Put dango in an airtight container and keep at room temperature for up to 2 days. If you live in a hot climate, find a cool place to store, but not in the refrigerator as dango will become too tough. Enjoy in 2 days.",en-US,{},4.47,,Just One Cookbook,90,8 serving(s)

Please use cake flour only! It’s important not to use flour with a high gluten content such as bread flour or all-purpose/plain flour for this recipe. Otherwise, you will end up with a rubbery cake.
To make crepe batter
Add the milk and sugar in a small sauce pan and combine well. Heat on medium heat until the milk is warm to touch.
Beat the eggs in a large bowl. Then slowly add a small amount of warm milk while whisking. While whisking, slowly add the melted butter to the mixture.
Set up a fine-mesh sieve over the bowl and add cake flour, matcha powder, and baking powder. Sift half of the dry ingredients into the batter and whisk to combine the dry and wet ingredients together.
Sift the rest of dry ingredients and mix until there is no lump in the batter. IMPORTANT: Do not overmix; mixing and stirring increases gluten formation in the batter, which causes a rubbery texture.
Set the fine-mesh sieve over a large bowl and pour the batter. This will remove any lumps and get a smooth texture. Cover with plastic wrap to refrigerate for at least 1 hour (DO NOT SKIP!). Tip: If you overmix the batter, you may want to rest the batter for longer hours. Resting the batter is important because it allows the gluten to relax. If you don't rest long enough the crepes will be more rubbery due to gluten development.
To cook the crepes
Set a 12-inch non-stick frying pan on low heat. Once the pan is hot, brush the oil and remove excess oil with a paper towel (don’t worry, oil is applied thinly). Gently stir the batter right before scooping with a ladle (otherwise, the batter will be too thick toward the end). Pour the batter just enough to cover the bottom of the frying pan, about 1/3 cup for my pan. After trying the first crepe and if you want to make a thinner crepe, gradually add milk to adjust the batter.
Cook for 2 minutes without touching. By now you’d see the outside edge of the crepe gets a tiny bit crispier. Using a chopstick, spatula, or hand, flip the crepe.
Cook the other side for 30 seconds and transfer to a working surface lined with parchment paper.
Set a 10-inch non-stick frying pan on low heat. Once the pan is hot*, brush the oil and remove excess oil with a paper towel. Pour the batter just enough to cover the bottom of the frying pan, about ¼ cup (60 ml) for my pan. *The hot pan helps the water in eggs and milk turn into steam and the crepe will puff up and become softer. But it can't be too hot, which ends up cooking the crepe too fast and you can't swirl the batter into a thin layer.
Cook for 2 minutes without touching. By now you’d see the outside edge of the crepe gets a tiny bit crispier. Using a chopstick, spatula, or hand, flip the crepe.
Cook the other side for 30 seconds and transfer to a working surface lined with parchment paper.
Continue this process until all the batter is used. Make sure to stir the batter EVERY TIME before you make a new batch (otherwise, the batter will be too thick toward the end). With this batter, I could make 1 large one that goes on top, and 13 crepes.
To make whipped cream
Prepare an ice bath by adding ice cubes and water to a larger bowl and set a smaller bowl on top. Add the heavy whipping cream and start whisking at the lower speed. Once you see bubbles, slowly add granulated sugar.
Whip the cream until stiff, not hard stiff (like 90%).
To assemble the mille crepe cake
Prepare two long parchment paper strips on a working surface or a rotating cake stand (I used IKEA's lazy susan). These strips will go under the first layer of crepe (this is for easy transportation).
First place the larger crepe. This will be the top layer when we flip. Put the freshly whipped cream in the middle and spread evenly, leaving the outer 2"" (5 cm).
Place another crepe on top and spread whip cream evenly, leaving outer ½ inch.
Continue this process until the last crepe is placed on top.
Prepare a round curved shallow dish (mine is from IKEA) and place a large piece of plastic wrap on top. Make sure to remove any air pockets and smooth them out. Transfer the mille crepe to the shallow dish by holding the strips you made. Once you place nicely in the middle of the bowl, remove the strips.
Wrap the mille crepe with plastic wrap from one corner to clockwise. This will make the final cake evenly round, instead of wrap randomly. Secure the end with a clip (I use one from IKEA). Refrigerate for at least 2 hours until the cake is set.
To serve
Once chilled, remove the plastic wrap and flip onto the serving platter.

In a medium bowl, whisk together 1/2 cup sugar and the egg yolks, until well blended and the mixture becomes pale yellow.
Temper the egg and sugar mixture with the milk and cream, adding 1/2 cup at a time, whisking vigorously. You don't want to cook the egg by pouring the milk and cream too fast.
Place a sieve over a large bowl and strain the mixture through the sieve.
Divide the liquid between 6 medium ramekins. Place the ramekins into a large deep baking or roasting pan.
Carefully pour boiling water into the pan to come halfway up the sides of the ramekins.
