"Eight Treasure Rice (八宝饭, Chinese Rice Pudding)",Maggie Zhu,https://omnivorescookbook.com/eight-treasure-rice/,Chinese,https://omnivorescookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2001_Eight-Treasure-Rice_550.jpg,"['1 1/2 cups (360 ml) glutinous rice', '2 tablespoons coconut oil ((or shortening))', '1 tablespoon sugar', '4 tablespoons red bean paste', '3 jujubes', '1 tablespoon golden raisins', '1 tablespoon pumpkin seeds', '1/2 tablespoon goji berries', '1 walnut half', '1 cup water', '2 tablespoons sugar', '1 heaping tablespoon dried chrysanthemum buds', '1 teaspoon cornstarch']","Soak rice ahead
Cover the glutinous rice with 2” (5cm) cold water and soak it for a minimum of 3 hours, preferably overnight.
1st steam
Once soaked, drain off the water and rinse the rice a few times.
Prepare your steamer by bringing the water to a boil.
Add the soaked rice into a heat-proof bowl and place it on the steamer rack. Steam, covered, for 30 minutes for overnight-soaked rice, or for 45 minutes for 3-hour-soaked rice. Once done, the rice should be edible, but still quite tough.
Assemble
While steaming the rice, arrange the rice toppings in the base of a wide heat-proof bowl. (*Footnote 2)
Once the rice is steamed, add the coconut oil and sugar. Stir thoroughly until the sugar melts and the rice is evenly coated with oil.
Press the seasoned rice into the bowl with the toppings. Be careful not to disturb the pattern you’ve created. Fill two thirds of the bowl with rice while creating a dent in the middle for the red bean paste.
Add the red bean paste in the middle and use the back of a spoon to flatten it into a thin layer.
Add the rest of the rice and use a spoon to flatten it.
At this stage, you can store the rice, covered with plastic wrap, in the fridge for 1 to 2 days. Follow the rest of the instructions prior to serving.
2nd steam
Place the assembled rice back to the steamer and steam it for an additional 30 minutes.
Syrup
Prepare the syrup while steaming the assembled rice. Combine the water, sugar, and chrysanthemum buds in a small saucepan and heat it over medium heat until boiling. Turn to medium-low heat. Simmer for 10 minutes.
Mix the cornstarch with 1 teaspoon of water until the cornstarch has dissolved completely.
When the chrysanthemum mixture is cooked, pour in the cornstarch slurry. Keep cooking and stirring constantly, until the syrup slightly thickens. Pour the syrup over a strainer into a bowl and discard the chrysanthemum buds.
Serving
When the treasure rice is done steaming, drizzle a few spoons of syrup onto the rice. Let it sit for 10 minutes.
To plate the rice, put a plate over the bowl and flip it in one swift motion. Remove the bowl and pour the remaining syrup over top of it. Serve warm.
Store
The cooked treasure rice can be stored in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 2 days. You can reheat it in the microwave.",en-US,"{'servingSize': '1 serving', 'calories': '284 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '52.9 g', 'proteinContent': '5.6 g', 'fatContent': '5.7 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '4.1 g', 'sodiumContent': '4 mg', 'fiberContent': '2.1 g', 'sugarContent': '10.4 g'}",5.0,,Omnivore's Cookbook,65,6 serving(s)

Immediately strain the cooked tapioca pearls with a fine sieve and rinse them with tap water to stop the cooking. Submerge the sieve with the cooked tapioca into a bowl of tap water to prevent the pearls from drying out. Set aside.
Add half of the mango chunks (I use the ones with imperfect shapes), about 2 cups, into a blender. Add the evaporated milk. Mix at the highest speed until it forms a smooth paste. Taste the paste. Add the sugar (if using) and blend to mix again if it’s not sweet enough.
To assemble, divide and add the tapioca pearls into serving bowls. Top with the mango paste, then add the coconut milk. Top with the mango chunks. Garnish with grapefruit, if using.

Gently rinse the dried lily flower buds, wood ear mushrooms, and shiitake mushrooms with tap water and transfer them into three bowls. Add 1/2 cup hot water to each bowl to cover. Let soak until tender throughout, 30 minutes or so. Once done, squeeze out the marinating liquid back into the bowls and gently rinse them with tap water again to remove any dust on the surface. Slice the shitake mushrooms. Cut the lily flowers in half. And chop the wood ear mushrooms into small pieces. Reserve the marinating liquid from the shiitake mushrooms and lily flowers for the gravy.
Prepare gravy
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the Sichuan peppercorns. Cook, stirring occasionally, until you can smell a strong fragrance and the peppercorns turn darker (but not black). Scoop out the Sichuan peppercorns and discard them (*Footnote 1).
Add the rehydrated lily flowers, shiitake mushrooms, and wood ear mushrooms. Cook, stirring frequently, for 1 minute or so. Be careful, the rehydrated ingredients might cause oil splatter.
Add the white part of the green onion and the ginger. Cook and stir for 30 seconds to release the fragrance.
Move everything to one side of the pan and add the remaining 1/2 tablespoon oil to the other side. Add the ground pork on top of the oil, then use a spatula to spread it out. Let the pork cook for a minute without moving to brown the bottom, then cut it into small pieces.
When the pork is cooked through, pour in the Shaoxing wine and scrape the pan to release any brown bits.
Pour in the light soy sauce and dark soy sauce. Stir to coat well.
Add the water and the reserved 1 cup of soaking water. And the chicken bouillon powder. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally, and cook for 2 minutes.
Meanwhile, dissolve the cornstarch in 1 tablespoon of water in a small bowl. Pour the cornstarch slurry into the pan. Stir to mix well and let cook until the sauce thickens. Taste the gravy and adjust the seasoning by adding a pinch of salt, if needed.
Serve
To serve, scoop the tofu pudding using a large spoon (the larger and flatter, the better) into two serving bowls. If too much liquid is pooling in the bowl, tilt the bowl carefully to drain off the excess liquid (it’s OK to have some liquid in the bowl). Ladle the gravy on top of the tofu pudding.

Combine the strawberries and sugar in a saucepan. Smash the strawberries into the sugar using your hands to release the juices. Add the star anise.
Heat the strawberry mixture over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until bringing to a boil. Turn to medium-low heat. Let simmer, stirring and mashing regularly, until the strawberries are fully broken down and the jam is thick enough to not run back immediately when stirred, 20 to 30 minutes. You can skim with a spoon to remove the foam, if you want the end result to have an even, bright color.
Transfer the jam to a heat-proof container and let cool completely.
Prepare the cookie dough
Combine the butter and sugar in a big bowl. Whisk with a wooden spatula until the sugar is fully incorporated and fluffy, with a white color, 5 minutes or so. You can also use a handheld mixer for this process.
Add the egg and vanilla. Beat the egg until fully mixed.
Add the flour. Mix until it forms a smooth dough.
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Transfer 1 heaping teaspoon of dough into your palm. Roll it into a dough ball with your hands. Place it onto the lined baking sheet. Repeat the process, spacing out the dough balls with 2” (5cm) between them. You might need to bake the cookies in two batches.
Use your finger to gently press the cookie dough balls, one at a time, to form a bowl shape to hold the jam.
Once you form a batch of cookies, let it chill in the fridge for 10 minutes before baking.
Bake
Chill the dough in the fridge for 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 °F (176 °C).
Bake the cookies for 8 to 10 minutes, until fully cooked through and the edge of the bottom turns light golden. Let cool for 5 minutes. Transfer the cookies onto a cooling rack to cool until they firm up.

Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl. Stir to mix well.
Prepare an electric mixer and set it aside. Create a double boiler by choosing a medium and a small pot, so you can stack the small one into the medium pot. Add water to the medium pot to the height that covers the bottom of the small pot. Bring water to a simmer. Add white chocolate, butter, lemon juice, and milk to the small pot. Dip the bottom of the small pot into the simmering water. Whisk and cook until the ingredients are melted and combined. Remove the small pot from the water and place it on a working surface.

Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 C). Bring a kettle of water to a boil, keep covered and sit on lowest heat to keep warm. Place eight 2.7-oz. (80ml) or four 6-oz (177-ml) ramekins (or heatproof jars) into a deep baking tray.
Add milk, cream, and ginger into a small saucepan. Cook over medium heat until almost simmering. Immediately remove the pan from the stove. Let steep for 15 minutes to allow the ginger to infuse. Remove ginger using a slotted spoon and discard. Cook the mixture again until it almost reaches a simmer.
While heating the cream mixture (after you've done infused the ginger), combine egg yolks and sugar in a medium-sized mixing bowl. Mix until the sugar is just incorporated.
Slowly pour about 1/2 cup of the heated cream mixture into the egg yolks and whisk until fully mixed. This step will bring the egg yolk toward the temperature of the hot liquid, so it won’t be cooked into solid egg when you add the rest of the cream.
Add the rest of the cream mixture while whisking, until everything is fully mixed. Pour the mixture over a strainer into a milk pan to remove any extra bits of ginger. Use a spoon to remove the foam from the surface and discard.
Pour the custard mixture into the ramekins until each of them is 80% filled.
Place the baking tray into the preheated oven. Then pour the hot water into the baking tray, until it fills half way up the height of the ramekins.
Bake until the mixture is just set, about 25 to 30 minutes. (*Footnote 1)
Remove the ramekins from the water bath using a spatula and transfer them onto a cooling rack. Let cool to room temperature, for about 1 hour. Then seal the ramekins with plastic wrap (or cover the jars with lids) and store them in the fridge for at least 1 hour, up to overnight, before serving. The custard will stay good for 3 to 4 days in the fridge, but freshly made ones taste the best.
Sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon over each chilled custard. Shake the ramekin gently so the surface is evenly covered. Light up your kitchen torch, then cook the sugar by positioning the torch at a 45-degree angle, about 6 inches (15-cm) from the sugar. Move your torch back and forth slowly so it heats up the sugar evenly and does not create any burned spots. When the sugar starts bubbling and melting and some spots turn light brown, stop the torch. The sugar will continue to cook a bit more and then set, forming a uniform golden brown crust.

Once the nest is soaked, gently tear it into smaller long pieces along the threads.
Braised bird's nest in Asian pear
Cut each Asian pear into two pieces by cutting through the core about 1/3 of the way from the top. Use the larger piece as a bowl and the smaller piece as the lid. Use a spoon or melon scoop to scoop out the inner part of the bigger piece and make the pear into a small bowl. You can cut a zig-zag pattern if you like. It won’t affect the cooking.
Divide up the bird nest and fill 2/3 of each pear with the nest. Add filtered water to cover, a few pieces of goji berries, and 1 piece rock sugar. Cover the pear with the lid you cut off earlier.
Place the pear in a small bowl and transfer the bowl into a big skillet. Add water until it reaches halfway up the bowl.
Cover the skillet and cook over medium high heat, until water reaches a boil and steam comes from the skillet. Turn to medium heat and let braise for 40 minutes.
Once the bird nests are cooked, transfer the small bowls onto the kitchen counter with your oven mitts on. Let cool until it can be handled by hand.
You can further sweeten it with syrup or honey, if needed. Serve the bird nest warm or at room temperature as a dessert.
Braised bird nest with papaya in coconut milk
Add cubed papaya into 4 medium-sized bowls, about 1/2 cup papaya per bowl. Divide bird nest into 4 portions and add into the bowls on top of the papaya. Add filtered water to cover. Place a small plate on top of each bowl as a cover.
Transfer the bowls into a big skillet and add water until it reaches halfway up the bowls.
Cover the skillet and cook over medium high heat, until water reaches a boil and steam comes from the skillet. Turn to medium heat and let braise for 40 minutes.
Once the bird nests are cooked, transfer the small bowls onto the kitchen counter with your oven mitts on.

How to Make Red Bean Paste,Maggie Zhu,https://omnivorescookbook.com/recipes/how-to-make-red-bean-paste/,Chinese,https://omnivorescookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Red-Bean-Paste-550.jpg,"['300 grams (10 ounces) azuki beans', '200 to 250 grams (7 - 9 ounces) rock sugar ((or white sugar))', '1/8 teaspoon salt']","To Cook with pressure cooker
Combine red beans and 3 cups of water in pressure cooker. Lock the lid and heat over medium high heat until rated pressure has been reached. Turn to lowest heat and cook at high pressure for 20 minutes. Turn off heat and allow the pressure release naturally.
Remove the lid and stir the beans several times. Add rock sugar and turn back to medium high heat. Stir the beans constantly with a spatula and boil until the mixture has thickened. When you draw a line in the mixture with a spatula and can see the bottom of the pot for 1 or 2 seconds, the beans are finished. Remove from heat and transfer to a large bowl. The red bean “soup” is, at this point, still a thick liquid and not quite as thick as a paste. It will thicken quickly after cooking down, and transform into a paste after it has been chilled.
The paste will last about a week in an airtight container in the fridge, or about a month in the freezer.
To Cook without pressure cooker
Rinse azuki beans and pre-soak them in room temperature water overnight.
Discard the soaking water. Combine beans and 4 cups water in a large pot. Bring the water to a boil, then turn to lowest heat. Simmer, covered, for about 1 hour, until beans are soft and can be easily mashed with a spatula. Throughout the simmering, check the water level and make sure the water still covers the beans, so they won’t be burnt on the bottom. Add water in small amounts, if necessary. Stir beans gently (without mashing them), occasionally during simmering.

Easy Pie Crust (with Food Processor),Maggie Zhu,https://omnivorescookbook.com/easy-pie-crust/,American,https://omnivorescookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/1710_Easy-Pie-Crust-With-Food-Processor_550.jpg,"['2 sticks (230 grams) cold unsalted butter', '2 and 1/2 cup (325 grams) all-purpose flour', '1 teaspoon salt', '1 tablespoon sugar', '1 cup ice cubes', '1 large egg', 'turbinado sugar for pie decorations ((Optional))']","Make the dough
Cut butter into 1/2-inch (1-cm) cubes, transfer to a bowl and place in the freezer for 5 minutes while preparing the dry ingredients. I always do this step to make sure the butter is very cold.
Combine 1 1/2 cups of the flour, salt, and sugar in a food processor. Pulse 2 to 3 times to mix well.
Add the butter cubes. Mix until the butter is chopped to small pieces and well coated with flour, about 15 seconds.
Scrape the bowl and add the remaining 1 cup flour. Pulse 4 to 5 times until the mixture looks crumbly. Transfer everything into a large bowl.
Add ice cubes into 1 cup of water to make ice water. Swirl 6 to 12 tablespoons of the cold water into the flour mixture, 2 to 3 tablespoons at a time, and stir with a fork until the water is fully absorbed. Use your hand to feel the dough often. The dough should hold together when you pinch the flour. If not, continue adding 1 tablespoon of water at a time, until the dough starts to come together. (*Footnote 1)
Start to use your hand to press the flakes and bring the dough together. It is OK if there are some crumbles around.
Transfer the dough and all the crumbles onto a well-floured working surface. Press the dough until it just forms a ball. Divide the dough into two pieces (*Footnote 2).
Wrap and seal the dough with plastic wrap, shape it into a round ball with your hands. Roll the ball into a 1-inch thick disk with a rolling pin.
Transfer the dough into the fridge and chill for at least 1 hour, up to 2 days. To store the dough for a longer time, place it into a ziplock bag, squeeze out the air, and seal. Freeze for up to 3 months and thaw in the fridge overnight before using.
Roll the pie dough for pie crust
Remove one piece of dough from the fridge, unwrap it, and place it on a well-floured working surface for 5 to 10 minutes.
Sprinkle flour on the top of the dough and onto your rolling pin. Try to roll the dough gently. If the dough starts to crack, let it rest for another one or two minutes, until it becomes more pliable.
Roll the dough using a rolling pin and swirl the dough frequently to prevent it from sticking. Roll out the dough into a round sheet that is about 1/8-inch (3-mm) thick, and 1-inch larger than the rim of your pie pan. Rotate the dough frequently so it won’t stick to the surface. Dust with more flour if needed.
Roll the dough over your rolling pin and unroll it over the baking dish (*Footnote 3). Gently arrange the dough to fit the pan. Trim off the excess dough with scissors, leaving about 1/2 inch (1-cm) from the rim of the baking pan.
Tuck the edge of the dough underneath so it creates a thick border that rests on the rim of the baking dish. Crimp the edges by pressing the edge with your finger while holding the two sides with the knuckles of your other hand.
Cover the dough with plastic wrap and transfer to the fridge. Let rest for 30 minutes to 1 hour, until it’s completely cooled and turns solid.
(Optional) make pie decorations (*Footnote 3)
Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper.
Beat the egg with 1 tablespoon water in a small bowl to make an egg wash.
Take out the smaller piece of dough and roll it out according to the pie crust instructions above. I prefer to leave the dough slightly thicker, somewhere between 1/8-inch and 1/4-inch thick (3 to 4-mm), so it’s easier to work with. For the pie decorations, dust extra flour onto the bottom of the dough, so it won’t stick when you cut the dough.
Dust a cookie cutter or decoration mold with flour to cut the dough. If you use the mold like I did, move the cutter around so the piece is completely cut off. Then gently push the lever 3 to 4 few times to make the leaf impression. Do not push it too hard, which will cause the dough to stick to the mold.
Hold the mold on top of the parchment paper and eject the dough. The pie decoration should come off quite easily, in the perfect shape.
Work on the rest of the dough sheet using the same method. Transfer the cookie sheet into the freezer to chill for 5 to 10 minutes, until completely cooled and solid.
Transfer the dough onto your working surface again. Brush the pattern side of the dough with a thin layer of egg wash. Sprinkle with turbinado sugar (*Footnote 4).
Bake
Adjust oven racks so that one is in the middle and one is on the bottom. Place a pizza stone on the bottom rack (Optional). Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 C).
Beat the egg with 1 tablespoon water in a small bowl to make an egg wash.
When the pie is well chilled, transfer it to the kitchen counter. Crumple a piece of parchment paper and flatten it, cover the bottom of the pie and arrange it so it fits the shape. Add pie weights, beans, or rice onto the parchment paper. Transfer the pie onto the pizza stone. Turn the oven to 400 F (200 C). Bake for 30 minutes, or until the edges turn golden.
Place the cookie sheet with pie garnish on the middle rack and bake until the surface turns golden, 15 to 17 minutes.
Once the pie crust is ready, transfer it to the kitchen counter and remove the pie weights. Brush the entire pie crust surface with a thin layer of egg wash. Return it to the bottom of the oven and bake for another 5 to 7 minutes, until the egg wash has dried completely and the bottom of the pie crust turns solid. If you plan to make the pie in advance, you can pre-bake the pie crust one day in advance.
Let the pie crust cool completely. Turn the oven to 350 F (176 C).
Now you can fill the pie with any filling you like, such as this light and fluffy kabocha pumpkin filling. If you are making a double-crust pie, cover the pie with the other piece of dough.
Now continue baking the pie until the filling is cooked, and the top crust turns golden (if using).
If you made pie decorations, garnish the cooked pie with them right before you’re ready to serve so they won’t turn soggy.",en-US,"{'servingSize': '1 of the 16 servings', 'calories': '184 kcal', 'sugarContent': '0.8 g', 'sodiumContent': '235 mg', 'fatContent': '12.2 g', 'carbohydrateContent': '16.3 g', 'fiberContent': '0.6 g', 'proteinContent': '2.6 g', 'cholesterolContent': '43 mg'}",-1.0,,Omnivore's Cookbook,360,2 serving(s)

Add glutinous rice into a big bowl and water to cover. Let soak overnight.
If using dried bamboo leaves
Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add bamboo leaves and boil for 5 to 8 minutes, until the leaves turn soft but are still green in color. Transfer the bamboo leaves to a plate.
If using fresh bamboo leaves
Heat a large pot of water to just under boiling. Turn off heat. Dip bamboo leaves in the hot water and let them soak for 1 to 2 minutes, until soft.
To wrap zongzi
Place the bamboo leaves, cotton twine, red bean paste, glutinous rice (do not discard the water), and two spoons on the working surface.
If the bamboo leaves are less than 8 cm (3 inches) wide, use two at a time. Otherwise, you can use one leaf. Overlap the leaves by 50% to 60% if using more than one. Fold the leaves with both hands to shape them like a funnel, without leaving an opening at the bottom.
Hold the funnel with one hand. Start adding glutinous rice into it with a spoon with the other hand, until halfway filled. You should add water with the rice, so the rice fills the leaf nicely while the water drips away from the bottom. Scoop about 1 tablespoon of red bean paste (or more if the zongzi size is bigger) and place it on the rice. Continue to fill the funnel with rice, until almost level with the edge. Pat the rice a bit so the top is flat. You don’t need to compress the rice too hard, otherwise the rice will be squeezed into the red bean paste.
Continue to hold the funnel with the same hand. Use the other hand to fold the longer side of the leaf as a lid to cover the rice. Continue to fold the longer side of the leaf, until it wraps the funnel. Hold the zongzi with one hand and use the other hand to tie it up with the cotton twine. The finished zongzi should have edges that are 8 to 10 centimeters (3 to 4 inches) long. Work on the rest of zongzi using the same method. (refer to the video for how to tie zongzi)
Place the zongzi in a large pot and add water until it almost covers the zongzi. Place a heavy plate on top to keep the zongzi in the water while cooking. Cover the pot and bring to a boil over high heat. Turn to low (or lowest) heat and let the water continue boiling. Keep covered and simmer for 3 hours.
Transfer one zongzi to a plate to cool off until you can handle it. Untie and slice it in half to make sure it’s cooked through (if the zongzi is very large, it might require more cooking time, up to 4 hours). Transfer all the zongzi to a plate to cool off.
Untie the zongzi right before serving and discard the leaves. Serve warm or cold with honey or sugar. Dip the zongzi in honey or sugar while eating.
To store zongzi, place in a plastic bags after cooling off and seal the bag. Store in fridge up to 3 days or in freezer up to 2 months.
To serve leftover zongzi. Let thaw completely (if frozen). Steam or gently boil in a pot of water until warm. Or you can place the zongzi on the kitchen counter until they return to room temperature, then serve cold.

Mince apples into 3 to 4 millimeters (0.1 inch) cubes. The 2 apples should generate about 4 cups of minced apple (about 500 grams / 1 pound).
Place apple and orange peel in a small saucepan and heat over medium heat. Stir and cook until the juice starts to come out, about 5 minutes. Add sugar and cook for another 5 minutes. Add cinnamon powder, cloves and salt and cook over medium heat until the sauce thickens. Begin adding apple juice, 4 tablespoons at a time. Continue cooking over medium heat, until the color of the apple turns amber and the sauce can hold its shape. The amount of apple juice you need will depend on the type of apple. I used 150 milliliters apple juice and 15 minutes for cooking two very crisp and sweet fuji apples.
Transfer the apple sauce to a small bowl to let it cool. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the fridge.
To make cookies
When the apple sauce has cooled off completely, add flour into a large glass bowl and set aside.
Add butter, vegetable oil, water, sugar and salt to a medium-size sauce pan. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally.
The butter will start to bubble and rise. The bubbles should be tiny and have a pale yellow color. When the bubbles subside, the color darkens, and the tiny bubbles nearly disappear, turn off heat immediately and add the hot butter mixture to the flour. Stir immediately with a silicone spatula until dough forms.
Wait until the dough cools off a bit and can be handled by hand, about 3 minutes. Knead the dough by hand a few times. Break off a piece of dough by hand. The dough should be very soft and easy to to spread without feeling crumbly. If the dough is too dry, blend in 1 to 2 teaspoons water and try again. Work on the dough while it’s warm.
To assemble cookies
Preheat oven to 210 degrees C (410 F). Line a baking tray with parchment.
Divide the dough into 4 approximately even sized pieces, then further divide each piece to 5 small doughs. Work on the small doughs one by one.
Use both hands to shape the dough into a round ball. Flatten the ball to a round disc, about palm-sized. Place about 1 teaspoon of applesauce in the middle of the dough.
Use right hand to wrap the dough toward the center, while using left hand to push the filling inside, until it shapes a ball. Shape the dough with both hands until round and place on parchment, at least a finger’s width apart. Work on the cookies one by one in this way.
Use a fork to prick the top of each cookie.
Bake at 210 degrees C (410 F) until the top of the cookies turns golden brown, about 15 minutes. Transfer the cookies to a wooden board to cool off completely.

Drain the water to remove the excess starch. Repeat once, then add water to cover. Soak the sticky rice for a minimum of 1 hour, up to 5 hours. Rinse again and drain the water.
Transfer the rice to a heatproof bowl, add about 2 inches of water to your steamer (not into the rice), place the heatproof rice bowl on the steaming rack in the steamer, and cover the steamer. Turn to medium-high heat to bring the water to a boil. When the steam starts to come out of the pot, turn to medium heat. Steam for 20 to 25 minutes, until the rice is cooked through, with no hard raw bits in the middle. Remove the pot from the stove. Let sit, covered, while you prepare the sauce.

Combine the cornstarch and 4 tablespoons water in a small bowl. Stir to completely dissolve the cornstarch. Add half of the slurry to the sauce. Stir immediately to thicken the sauce. You can adjust the thickness of the sauce by slowly adding a bit more water or cornstarch slurry, if needed. The sauce shouldn’t be too thick, but should coat the back of a spoon.
Carefully remove the sticky rice bowl from the steamer with your oven mitts on. Pour half of the sauce into the bowl. Stir to mix well.

To serve, transfer the coconut rice into serving bowls or plates. Place the sliced mango on the side. Pour a few spoonful of the extra coconut sauce on top of the rice. Garnish with toasted sesame seeds, if using.
If you use refrigerated sticky rice, you can gently heat it in the microwave to bring it to room temperature before serving, for a better texture.

Place milk and butter into a small bowl, heat under medium low heat in microwave for 1 minute, mix a few times until butter is melt, set aside to chill down.
Preheat oven to 170 degrees C (338F). Grease butter on baking pan, then sprinkle with flour.
In a large bowl, add egg white and mix by medium speed with a electronic mixer until it shapes a very light, fluffy and even foam (left picture). Add half amount of sugar and keep mix by medium speed until sugar is cooperate, then add the rest of sugar, keep mix until the texture turns to creamy and firm. When you pull the mixer out off the mixture, the cream could shape a triangle and stand. Then it's ready. (right picture)

Switch from electronic mixer into rubber spatula. Whisk flour into the mixture and use spatula to mix gently, until flour is fully cooperate. Do not over mix. Slowly add milk and butter, and mix gently until the mixture turns to a even and medium thick batter. Pour batter into baking pan.
Place 2 layers of towel on table, drop the baking pan from 20 centimeters (0.6 feet) high, in order to get the surface of batter flat and get extra air out. Place in low level of oven and bake for around 30 minutes, until the surface turns brown. Put a toothpick into the cake and pull out, the toothpick should come out clear.
After the cake is cooked, take out from oven, and immediately drop the baking pan from 30 centimeters (1 feet) high.

Tang Yuan (Sweet Rice Balls with Peanut Butter Filling),Maggie Zhu,https://omnivorescookbook.com/tang-yuan/,Chinese,https://omnivorescookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/1701_Tang-Yuan_003.jpg,"['1/2 cup shelled peanut', '1/2 cup original peanut butter (, unsweetened)', '1 cup caster sugar', '1/4 cup (4 tablespoons) butter (, softened (or lard in room temperature, or melt coconut oil for a vegetarian option) (*footnote 1))', '2 cups (250 grams) glutinous rice flour ((*footnote 2))', '1 cup warm water']","Peanut butter filling
Spread peanuts in a pan and heat over medium heat on stove. When the pan turns warm, turn to medium low heat. Shake the pan occasionally for even cooking. Toast until the peanuts turn golden but not darkly browned. Alternatively, you can roast the peanuts in 350 F oven for 8 to 15 minutes, or until the surface turns golden. Shake the pan occasionally during baking.
Ground the peanuts in batches by using a coffee grinder, in a mini food processor, or by using a mortar and pestle until finely grounded, but not into powder. You can leave the pieces a bit larger if you want a chewy texture. Transfer to a bowl. Add peanut butter, sugar and coconut oil. Stir to mix well. Transfer to fridge to harden for about 30 minutes or longer, until it’s possible to scoop out the filling and shape it. If you leave the filling in the fridge for a longer time, it will harden even more and might be a bit difficult to shape. If this is the case, place the filling in room temperature for 5 minutes to let it soften a bit before shaping.
Use a small spoon to scoop about 1 teaspoon to 1 and 1/2 teaspoon of filling. Shape it quickly into a ball, and place on a small tray or in a container.
Transfer the peanut butter balls into the freezer while making the dough.
Dough
Add glutinous rice flour in a big bowl. Slowly add warm water and whisk with a pair of chopsticks (or a spatula). When the water is fully absorbed, use your hands to press and work it into a dough. If the dough is too sticky, add more glutinous rice flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, and keep kneading the dough. Unlike wheat flour dough, rice flour dough does not require a lot of kneading, so it is done once the dough is shaped. Transfer the dough to a big bowl and cover with plastic wrap or a clean wet towel, to prevent it from drying out.
Wrap
Divide the dough into 4 equal pieces. Shape each piece into a round ball. Work on one dough ball at a time and return the three dough balls back into the large bowl, then cover with plastic wrap.
Roll the dough ball into a long even strip. Cut to 8 pieces. Roll into small balls.
Work on the dough balls one by one. Flatten the dough into a round disk that has a dent in the center. Place the filling in the center of the dough. Seal the filling carefully by wrapping and spreading the dough. When you cannot see the filling anymore, roll the dough into a round ball by using both hands.
If you find the dumpling is too difficult to seal, knead the rest dough balls back together into one big dough ball again, cut into 5 pieces to 6 pieces and try again. It is very important to wrap and seal the dough tightly, so the dumplings won’t fall apart during cooking.
The filling will become soft if placed in room temperature for too long and become very difficult to wrap, especially if you’re using coconut oil. I suggest you to take out a few filling balls at a time to work with, and store the rest in the freezer.
Work on the rest of the dough balls using the same method.
Now you can cook the rice balls or freeze them for later.
Cook
Bring a pot of water to a boil. Carefully add the number of rice balls you plan to serve. Cook and stir occasionally until the rice balls float on top and the skins look translucent.
Immediately transfer the rice balls to small serving bowls with just enough boiling water to cover them. We usually eat the rice balls with some boiling water. If it’s not sweet enough for you, add a few drops of honey or osmanthus syrup into the boiling water to sweeten it.
Store
Place leftover filling in a ziplock bag, squeeze out as much as air as possible, and seal. Store in the fridge for 1 week or in the freezer for up to 3 months.
To store the raw tang yuan, place them on a tray, 1 finger apart, and cover with a plastic wrap. Freeze until completely frozen. Transfer to a ziplock bag or airtight container, store in the freezer for 2 to 3 months.
Note, you should always cook the amount of tang yuan you plan to serve and eat them while they’re warm, soon after cooking. Always store the extra tang yuan in the raw form in freezer.",en-US,{},5.0,,Omnivore's Cookbook,50,24 serving(s)

Measure out 1 cup of water (You will use slightly less than a cup). Slowly add water into the flour in 4 to 5 pours, and stir with a fork until the water is fully incorporated with the flour. There should be no dry flour left, and the flour should start to have the texture of dough - soft but not runny. If the dough gets too soft and becomes difficult to shape, add more rice flour, a tablespoon at a time. Use your hand to press and knead the dough a few times, until the texture becomes consistent (* see footnote). The dough should be soft and easy to shape. When you lift the dough from the bowl, it should slightly stick to the bottom of the bowl.
Dust a working surface with rice flour and transfer the dough onto it. Divide the dough in half. Roll the dough with both hands to shape it into a long, even rod. Divide the dough equally into 6 pieces. Shape each piece into a round ball and set aside.
To make the cake, place one rice dough ball in your palm and use the other hand to gently press it into a round, flat piece (it’s very easy to shape, so you won’t need a rolling pin), about 6 centimeters (2.5 inches) in diameter, 6 millimeters (1/4 inch) in thickness.
Scoop about 2 tablespoons of red bean paste and shape the paste into a ball. Place the ball of bean paste in the center of the round dough.

Mix the cornstarch, all-purpose flour, and half of the sugar together in a small bowl.
Place the egg yolks in a large bowl. Stir a few times to mix the yolks.
Add the milk and the remaining half of the sugar into a small saucepan. Heat over medium heat. Stir occasionally to dissolve the sugar completely. Cook until it reaches about 120 F/ 49 C (no more than 150 F / 65 C). You might see a few bubbles here and there. If the milk starts foaming, it’s too hot.
While the milk starts to get warm, add the dry ingredients (from step 1) into the bowl with the egg yolks. Whisk until it forms an even paste. Do not add the dry ingredients too early, because the sugar will change the texture of the eggs.
Add the warm milk into the egg yolk mixture, about 1/4 cup at a time. Whisk constantly until the milk is fully incorporated into the paste. Continue to add more milk a 1/4 cup at a time and keep stirring, until it forms a thin, smooth mixture and all the milk is added.
Return the mixture back into the pot (the one you used to heat the milk). Heat over medium heat and stir constantly, until the mixture thickens, 5 minutes or so. Keep cooking and stirring, until you can draw a line on the bottom of the pot using a spatula. (Note, the custard will start to thicken suddenly, like a switch was flipped. So you should keep a close eye on it.)
Remove the pot from the stove immediately. Add the butter and vanilla extract. Stir to mix well.
Line a large deep plate with plastic wrap. Place a large mesh strainer on top.
Pour the custard into the lined plate over the strainer to smooth out the texture. Use a spatula to press the strainer if any lumps remain.
Cover the custard with plastic wrap. Press the wrap against the custard, so it won’t form a skin once it’s chilled.
Chill the custard in the fridge until it’s cooled completely, 2 hours or so. Or in the freezer for 30 mins.
Prepare the mooncake dough
Prepare a large bowl that can fit into your steamer. Place a large strainer on top.
In another medium-sized bowl, add the glutinous rice flour, rice flour, and cornstarch. Mix well with a fork.
Line a large mesh strainer over the bowl and sift the confectioner's sugar through it. Use your fingers or a spoon to press the sugar through if any lumps exist.
Add the milk, oil, and vanilla extract into a small bowl. Stir to mix well.
Use your fork to form a hole in the middle of the flour. Add 2 to 3 tablespoons of the milk mixture at a time. Stir until the liquid is incorporated into the flour completely. Repeat the process until it forms a very runny batter.
Pour the mixture into the large bowl (you prepared in step 1) over the strainer. Press the lumps using a spoon. Once strained, the mixture will thicken a little bit.
Prepare a steamer by pouring 1 inch (2.5 cof water into the steamer pot. Cover and heat over medium-high heat until boiling. Place the bowl with the batter into the steamer rack. Place the rack over the boiling pot. Cover and steam until the batter is cooked completely, 15 to 20 minutes. After 15 minutes, examine the dough by inserting a spoon into the middle. The spoon should come out clean, and the dough should feel very stiff.
Once done, remove the lid, and transfer the steaming rack with the bowl onto your kitchen counter to cool off for a few minutes.
Fold a kitchen towel a few times and place it on your working surface. Remove the bowl with the dough wearing oven mitts, and transfer the bowl onto the towel.
Scrape the dough from the bowl and knead it using a spoon, until it forms a dough ball, 5 minutes or so.
Transfer the dough onto a clean surface. Note, do not add any flour onto the surface or dust your hands with it. Knead the dough using your hands until it’s smooth, 5 minutes or so. The dough will soften once done.
Wrap the dough with plastic wrap and chill it in the fridge for 30 minutes.
Ingredient storage
You can keep the dough and the custard filling refrigerated for a couple of hours, up to overnight, until ready to assemble. The dough will become a bit stiff if you chill it overnight. If you want the freshest taste, you should assemble the mooncakes the same day you make the dough and filling.
Assemble the mooncakes
Form the custard into balls - Measure 25 grams of filling (about 1 round tablespooand use your hands to press and roll, until it forms a ball. You can wear rubber gloves to help with this process.
Transfer the filling balls into a container and cover it with the lid. Chill for another 30 minutes.
Form the dough into balls - Measure 25 grams of dough (about 1 round tablespooand use your hands to roll it into a ball. Place the dough balls into a container and cover. Chill in the fridge until the custard is ready to use.
Place the dough ball on a clean working surface. Use a rolling pin to roll it into an even, thin, round disc that is about 4” (9 to 10 cin diameter. Carefully remove it from the surface onto your palm.
Place a custard ball in the center of the wrapper. Use your other hand to gather the wrapper onto the top of the custard filling. The dough sheet will start to form pleats and create a thicker layer. Try to pinch the extra dough together using your fingers, and pinch off the dough. The process will keep the mooncake skin even and thin, to create a better mouthfeel. Once done, place the mooncake onto a plate, pleated-side-down. Loosely cover it with plastic wrap to prevent them from drying out. Repeat the process to wrap the rest of the mooncakes.
To mold the mooncakes
Install the pattern plate into the mooncake mold, with the pattern side facing downward. If you’re using the round shape, you can twist the lever of the mold so the pattern plate will snap onto the lever. It’s not required but it makes the process a bit easier.
Dust the mooncake with a very thin layer of cornstarch. (*Footnote 1)
Carefully place the wrapped mooncake balls into the mold, smooth surface against the pattern plate.
Place the mold onto a clean, flat surface. Gently press the lever until the dough is against your table surface. Hold it for at least 30 seconds. It will help the pattern to form. Once done, push the lever to release the mooncake. Repeat the process to mold all the mooncakes.
The mooncakes are ready to eat!
Storage
Transfer the mooncakes into an airtight container. Store them in the fridge for 3 to 4 days. To enjoy the mooncakes with a better texture, transfer them to your kitchen counter and wait for them to return to room temperature. You can eat the chilled mooncakes, but the skin will be a bit stiff.
Note, do not freeze the mooncakes.

Microwave the kabocha squash for 2 to 3 minutes, so it’ll be much easier to cut. Halve the kabocha by tilting your knife to a 45-degree angle and slicing it down from the bottom of the squash (the softer part). Then cut to 1-inch thick slices.
Prepare a steamer with 2 inches of water in it. Top with steaming rack, and place the pumpkin on the rack. Cook covered over medium high heat until it reaches a boil and steam comes out from the lid. Steam until the squash turns tender throughout, about 15 minutes.
Transfer the kabocha to a plate and let cool for 15 minutes, until it can be handled by hand. Peel off the skin with a knife and discard. Measure 3 heaping cups (400 grams) of kabocha and transfer to a blender (I used Vitamix).
Add the butter, heavy cream, milk, brown sugar, eggs, butter, ginger, cinnamon, and salt into the blender. Turn on low spead and gradually increase to high. Blend until it forms a silky puree, 15 to 20 seconds. The puree should have a consistency thick enough to coat a spoon. You can add more milk if the texture is too thick, or add more squash if it’s too runny.
Layer a few dish towels on your kitchen counter. Drop the blender bowl from a 2-inch height onto the dish towels a few times, to release the bubbles that have formed in the puree. Transfer into a big bowl. The puree can be made a day earlier and stored in an airtight container in the fridge.
Bake
Sprinkle a thin layer of flour onto a clean working surface and place the pie dough on top. Let rest for 5 to 10 minutes, until it’s soft enough to roll out without cracking.
Dust the top of the pie dough and your rolling pin with flour. Roll out the dough into a round sheet that is about 1/8-inch (3-mm) thick, and 1-inch larger than the rim of your pie pan. Rotate the dough frequently so it won’t stick to the surface. Dust with more flour if needed.
Roll the dough over your rolling pin and unroll it over the baking dish. Gently arrange the dough to fit the pan. Trim off the excess dough with scissors, leaving about 1/2 inch (1-cm) from the rim of the baking pan.
Tuck the edge of the dough underneath so it creates a thick border that rests on the rim of the baking dish. Crimp the edges by pressing the edge with your finger while holding the two sides with the knuckles of your other hand.
Cover the dough with plastic wrap and transfer to the fridge. Let rest for 30 minutes to 1 hour, until it’s completely cooled and turns solid.
Adjust oven racks, so one is in the middle and one is on the bottom. Place a pizza stone on the bottom rack (Optional). Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 C).
Beat the egg with 1 tablespoon water in a small bowl to make an egg wash.
When the pie is well chilled, transfer to the kitchen counter. Crumple a piece of parchment paper and flatten it, cover the bottom of the pie and arrange it so it fits the shape. Add pie weights, beans, or rice onto the parchment paper. Transfer the pie onto the pizza stone. Turn the oven to 400 F (200 C). Bake for 30 minutes, or until the edges turn golden.
(Optional) If you made the pie garnish, you can now place them on the middle rack and bake until the surface turns golden, 15 to 17 minutes.
Transfer the pie crust to the kitchen counter and remove the pie weights. Brush the entire pie crust surface with a thin layer of egg wash. Return it to the bottom of the oven and bake for another 5 to 7 minutes, until the egg wash has dried completely and the bottom of the pie crust turns solid. If you plan to make the pie in advance, you can pre-bake the pie crust one day in advance.
Let the pie crust cool completely. Turn the oven to 350 F (176 C).
Fill the pie with the kabocha squash puree, up to 3/4 of the crust. Bake on the middle rack until the filling sets and the center jiggles slightly, about 40 minutes. Transfer the pie to a cooling rack and let cool completely before serving.

Combine the minced ginger and hot water in a small bowl. Stir to mix well and set aside.
Prepare the dough
In a large tall plate or a big bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, cornstarch, instant yeast and sugar. Stir to mix well.
Slowly pour in the warm water, a few tablespoons at a time, and mix with a pair of chopsticks (or a fork). Once all the water has been added, keep mixing and scrape off the dry flour on the side of the bowl, until it forms many small dough flakes.
Pour in the vegetable oil. Keep mixing with the chopsticks until the oil is absorbed.
Start kneading by hand while further incorporating the dry flour, until there’s no dry flour left in the bowl.
Transfer the dough onto a working surface. Knead for 15 to 20 minutes, until the dough is quite smooth and elastic and there’s no dry flour left in the bowl. It’s OK if there’s some unevenness in the dough, which will smooth out after resting. The dough should be quite tough and not sticky to the touch. Cover and seal the bowl with plastic wrap. Let rest until it doubles in size, 1 hour or so.
Prepare the filling
Add the ginger water, light and dark soy sauce, Shaoxing wine, salt, sugar, and white pepper to the ground pork in a large bowl. Beat with a pair of chopsticks or a wooden spatula in a circular motion, until all the liquid is absorbed and the meat is sticky. This process might take a few minutes. (*Footnote 4)
Add the green onions and sesame oil. Mix until they are incorporated. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Store in the fridge until ready to use.
Assemble the buns
When the dough has rested, transfer to a work surface and punch it down. Knead for 1 minute to deflate the air out completely, then form it back into a ball.
Cut the dough in half. Wrap half of the dough in plastic wrap and store in the fridge while working on the other half.
Poke a hole in the center of the dough you’re working with. Stretch the dough into a large oval by running your fingers along the inside of the hole in a circular motion. Once the diameter of the dough is about 1” (2.5 cm), tear apart the ring so it creates a long, thin strip.
Cut the dough strip into 12 even pieces by cutting it in half, then further cut each half into 6 pieces. Gently use a circular motion to round up each dough piece then flatten it with your palm. Cover them with plastic wrap to prevent drying out.
Work on one piece of dough at a time - take one dough piece and place in front of you. Roll it with a rolling pin in one hand, using the other hand to rotate the dough while rolling, until the diameter reaches 5” (13 cm). You should keep the edges thinner than the center, so the wrapper of the bun will be even once you make the pleats.
Place the rolled dough in your palm and add 1 tablespoon of filling in the center.
Start wrapping the bun by folding and pinching the edge over itself, in one direction, until it is almost sealed. Then rotate and pinch the top of the pleats to fully seal the bun. (View my video for more details)
Repeat with the remaining dough pieces to wrap all the buns. Keep the wrapped buns under a piece of plastic wrap to prevent drying out. Once done wrapping, let rest for 10 minutes. Once rested, you should cook the buns immediately. You can store the wrapped buns in a sealed container in the fridge for up to 1 hour before cooking.
Repeat the wrapping steps to wrap the other half of the dough.
To cook the buns:
Add 2 tablespoons of oil and carefully place 12 wrapped buns into a 9” or 10” skillet. Heat over medium-high heat until hot. Turn to medium heat. Cook, uncovered, for 3 minutes, until the bottoms are lightly browned.
Pour about 1/4 cup hot water into the pan, just enough to cover the buns halfway up. Cover the pan and cook over medium heat for about 8 minutes, until the water is completely evaporated.
Turn the heat to medium-low and cook for another 2 to 3 minutes. Turn the heat off and remove the pan from the stove. Let the buns rest with the lid on for an additional 2 minutes. Remove the lid and transfer to a plate. Repeat the steps to cook the rest of the buns.
Serve hot immediately. (*Footnote 5) Or you can store the cooked buns in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 4 days or in the freezer for up to 3 months.",en-US,"{'servingSize': '1 bun', 'calories': '74 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '10.8 g', 'proteinContent': '3.7 g', 'fatContent': '1.7 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '0.3 g', 'cholesterolContent': '7 mg', 'sodiumContent': '85 mg', 'fiberContent': '0.5 g', 'sugarContent': '0.4 g'}",4.5,,Omnivore's Cookbook,150,24 serving(s)
