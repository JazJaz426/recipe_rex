Char Siu Bao (Steamed BBQ Pork Buns),Maggie Zhu,https://omnivorescookbook.com/steamed-char-siu-bao/,Chinese,https://omnivorescookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/1911_Char-Siu-Bao_550.jpg,"['125 g (1/2 cup) water (, warm)', '7 g (1 packet / 2 teaspoons) active dry yeast', '60 g (4 tablespoons) sugar', '250 g (1 2/3 cup) low-gluten flour ((or cake flour))', '7 g (2 teaspoons) baking powder', '7 g (1 1/2 teaspoons) shortening', '1/4 cup low-sodium chicken stock', '2 tablespoons hoisin sauce', '2 tablespoons oyster sauce', '2 tablespoons Shaoxing wine ((or dry sherry))', '1 tablespoon sugar', '1 clove garlic (, grated)', '1/8 teaspoon five spice powder', '1 1/2 tablespoon cornstarch', '1 1/2 cups Char Siu (Chinese BBQ pork) (, chopped (*Footnote 1))']","Prepare the dough
Add the water into a small bowl and warm to approximately 100-110°F (38°C), about 30 seconds in the microwave. The water should be warm, just a bit above body temperature. Add the sugar and active dry yeast, stir to mix well. Let sit for 5 minutes so the yeast will activate.
While the yeast activates, add the cake flour and baking powder into your mixer bowl.
Once the yeast is activated, you should see bubbles on the surface of the mixture. Pour it into the mixer bowl. Mix it with a spatula a few times, until the liquid is just absorbed by the dry ingredients.
Install the dough hook on your mixer. Start at low speed, then gradually increase to speed setting to 6 out of 10. Knead for 10 minutes, until the dough is very smooth. Stop the mixer halfway through and scrape the dough from the sides of the bowl.
Add the shortening. Knead on level 6 for another 5 minutes. The dough should be soft, smooth, and easily lifted from the bowl without sticking to your hands.
Lightly grease a large bowl with butter or oil spray. Transfer the dough into the bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it rest in a warm part of your room, until the size triples, about 2 hours.
Prepare the char siu filling
Combine the stock, hoisin sauce, oyster sauce, Shaoxing wine, sugar, garlic, and five spice powder in a small saucepan. Cook over medium heat until boiling. Turn to medium-low heat and let simmer for 1 minute. Stir occasionally until everything is mixed. Once done, remove the pan from the stove and let the sauce cool for 3 to 5 minutes.
While cooling the sauce, add the cornstarch and 1 tablespoon of water into a small bowl. Stir to mix until the cornstarch is fully dissolved. Pour the cornstarch into the sauce. Stir to mix well. Turn the heat back on, to medium-low. Bring the sauce to a gentle simmer and stir constantly, until thickened. You should be able to draw lines on the bottom of the pan easily.
Transfer the sauce into a medium-sized bowl. Add the char siu meat. Stir to mix well.
Assemble and cook
Cut some parchment paper into 3” (7 cm) squares to hold the buns. You’ll need 16 squares.
Punch the air out of the dough. Transfer it onto a lightly oiled working surface. Knead a few times to make the dough into a round ball. Divide the dough into 16 even pieces by cutting it into 2 even strips, then further cutting each strip into 8 small pieces. Each piece of dough should weigh 27 grams. Use your hands to roll and shape the dough pieces into dough balls.
Wrap the buns one at a time. Flatten a dough ball using your palm. Use a rolling pin to roll the dough ball into a round disc that is thick in the middle and thin on the edges, about 2.5 to 3” (6 to 7 cm) in diameter. Carefully remove it from the surface and place it onto your palm.
Place about a heaping tablespoon of the char siu mixture onto the center of the wrapper. Wrap the bun by pinching two ends of the dough together, then pinching the other two ends together. Press the dough edges together so it forms a square bun with a cross on top. Pinch the two opposite edges together, then repeat with the remaining two edges. Now the bun will be round. Check my blog post above to see the step-by-step wrapping pictures.
Once done, place the char siu bun onto one of the cut parchment squares, pleated-side-down, then place it on a plate. Loosely cover it with plastic wrap to prevent drying out. Repeat the process to wrap the rest of the buns.
Set a stopwatch (or timer) after wrapping the first bun, to keep track of the resting time. You need to rest the buns for 20 to 30 minutes before steaming them.
Steaming
Depending on the size of your steamer, you might need to steam the buns in batches. What I usually do is prepare the steamer after wrapping half of the buns, so some of them are ready to be cooked as I work on the rest.
To prepare the steamer, add about 3” (7 cm) of water to the pot and heat it over medium-high heat until the water starts to boil. Place the rested buns onto the steamer rack, leaving at least 2” (5 cm) between them, because the buns will expand a lot as they cook.
Cover and steam for 10 minutes. Once done, remove the steamer rack and place it onto a trivet. Uncover the steamer rack carefully. Let the steam out and then transfer the buns onto a serving plate. Let the buns cool for 5 minutes before eating.
Cook the rest of the buns using the same method.
Serve and store
The char siu buns taste best when they are hot or warm. If you made them in advance, you can warm them up in the microwave or in a steamer.
Once the buns have cooled completely, place them in a sealed container in the fridge for up to 3 days.
You can store the cooked buns in the freezer for up to a month. To cook the frozen buns, thaw them completely in the fridge. Then heat them up in the microwave or in a steamer until heated through.",en-US,"{'servingSize': '1 serving', 'calories': '125 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '20 g', 'proteinContent': '9.1 g', 'fatContent': '1.8 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '0.5 g', 'cholesterolContent': '18 mg', 'sodiumContent': '180 mg', 'fiberContent': '0.7 g', 'sugarContent': '7.5 g'}",4.43,,Omnivore's Cookbook,210,16 serving(s)
Addictive Kimchi Pork Steamed Buns,Maggie Zhu,https://omnivorescookbook.com/recipes/addictive-kimchi-pork-steamed-bun/,Chinese,https://omnivorescookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Kimchi-Pork-Steamed-Bun-550.jpg,"['250 grams (9 ounces) all-purpose flour ((plus extra to dust the working surface))', '1 teaspoon instant dry yeast ((or 1 and 1/2 active dry yeast))', '170 milliliters (6 ounces) water', '200 grams (7 ounces) ground pork ((lean-fat ratio 7:3))', '2 tablespoons Shaoxing wine', '1 and 1/2 tablespoons light soy sauce', '300 grams (10 ounces) kimchi ((*see footnote 1))']","Combine flour and dry yeast in a large bowl and mix well. Prepare a small bowl with extra flour on the side.
Slowly pour the water into the bowl with the flour and yeast, mixing them with a pair of chopsticks. When the water is mixed with the flour, dust both hands with flour and start kneading to form dough. The dough should be quite soft and sticky. When dough has formed, dust the working surface with flour and dust hands again. Transfer the dough to the working surface and continue to knead the dough until the surface of the dough becomes smooth and its texture springy, about 5 minutes. Dust hands and the working surface with extra flour whenever the dough starts to feel sticky during the process.
Rinse a clean dish towel with water. Dust the bottom of a large bowl with flour and transfer the dough to it. Cover bowl with the damp dish towel and a lid (or plastic wrap). Let the dough rest until its size doubles, 2.5 to 3 hours (depending on room temperature) (*see footnote 2).
When the dough is almost ready, combine ground pork, Shaoxing wine, and soy sauce in a medium-sized bowl and mix well.
Mince kimchi into small pieces. Add it to the ground pork and mix them well.
The dough should be very fluffy and sticky now. Dust the working surface and your hands with extra flour and transfer the dough onto the surface. Use a rubber spatula if the dough is too sticky and difficult to handle. Knead the dough repeatedly and add more flour if necessary, until the dough has shrunk almost to its original size and has become smooth and springy again, 3 to 5 minutes. The purpose of this step is to squeeze the air bubbles from the dough, so the bun will have a smooth texture once cooked.
To make the bun wrappers, divide the dough into two equal pieces. Roll each piece of dough a few times into a long stick, then further divide to make 12 to 14 small doughs in total (see footnote 3).
Dust the working surface again. Take one dough and roll it a few times, until shaped into a ball. Press the dough to a round disc and roll it with a rolling pin into a round sheet. Try to roll so that that the edge is thinner than the center. The edge should be 2 to 3 millimeters (about 0.1 inch) and the center 4 to 5 millimeters (0.2 inch) in thickness (*see footnote 4).
Scoop about 2 of tablespoons pork and kimchi filling and place it in the center of the wrapper. Hold the bun with one hand and start sealing the bun with the other hand (refer to the video to see how to fold a bun). Place the bun on the working surface and work on the rest of the doughs in the same manner.
Place a large container or a bowl upside down to cover the buns. Let them rest for 15 minutes.
Add water into a large pot and place the steaming rack on or in the pot, as the case may be. The water should be at least 3 centimeters (1 inch) below the steaming rack. Wet a clean kitchen towel and place it on the steaming rack (or you could cut baking parchment into a round shape to fit the steaming rack. Cut a few round holes in the parchment so the steam can go through). Carefully transfer the buns to the steaming rack, at least one finger’s width apart. Cook the buns in two to three batches if the steaming rack cannot fit all the buns. Add more water to the pot after each batch if the water level is running low.
Cover and cook over high heat (or highest heat for electric stove). When water starts to boil, turn to medium high heat and continue to cook for 10 minutes (12 minutes if you make 12 bigger buns), until the buns are cooked through. Stop heat and let the steam release for a few minutes. Carefully transfer the buns to a plate. Cook the remainder of the buns in the same way.
Serve warm as main course or snack.",en-US,"{'servingSize': '67 g', 'calories': '110 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '17.1 g', 'proteinContent': '6.8 g', 'fatContent': '0.8 g', 'cholesterolContent': '12 mg', 'sodiumContent': '275 mg', 'fiberContent': '0.7 g'}",4.89,,Omnivore's Cookbook,210,12 serving(s)
Candied Walnuts with Spice,Maggie Zhu,https://omnivorescookbook.com/candied-walnut/,chinese american,https://omnivorescookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/1911_Candied-Walnuts-with-Chinese-Spice_550.jpg,"['2 cups (6 oz / 180 g) skinless raw walnuts halves', '2/3 cup sugar', '3 cups water', '2 cups vegetable oil (, for frying (skip if using the baking method))', '1 teaspoon salt', '1/2 teaspoon nutmeg', '1/2 teaspoon ground ginger', '1/2 teaspoon paprika', '1/4 teaspoon ground Sichuan peppercorn', '1/4 teaspoon cumin']","Combine the ingredients for the spice mix in a small bowl. Stir to mix well.
Add the walnuts, sugar, and water into a saucepan or large nonstick skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until bringing to a boil. Turn to medium heat. Let cook, stirring occasionally, until the water has mostly evaporated. Turn to medium low heat and continue cooking until the walnuts are glazed. There will be some syrup left on the bottom of the pan, and the nuts should look shiny without any crystalized sugar on them. The whole process should take anywhere from 15 to 25 minutes, depending on the heat setting.
If the sugar on the walnuts crystalizes, add another 1/4 cup water. Cook and stir until the crystals disappear. Set the heat to low when the nuts are ready to fry.
Deep frying method (recommended)
Once the nuts have cooked for 10 minutes, heat another medium-sized saucepan with 2” (5 cm) oil over medium heat until it reaches 350 °F (176 °C).
As soon as the walnuts are properly glazed, begin frying them in batches. Use a slotted spoon or spider skimmer to drain the nuts of any excess syrup and carefully lower them into the oil. Do not fry too many nuts at a time, only enough to barely form one layer in the frying pot. Remove the nuts from the oil when the nuts begin to float and turn dark amber, 30 seconds to a minute. Drain the excess oil from the nuts and transfer them to a heatproof bowl such as a ceramic one.
Add a few pinches of the spice mix to the bowl and toss them together while the nuts are still hot, to evenly coat the nuts with spice mix. Taste one of the coated nuts (be careful when it’s still hot), and adjust the seasoning according to your taste.
Spread the spice-coated nuts onto a tray lined with a cooling rack. Let cool completely before serving. Repeat the process to fry the rest of the nuts.
The nuts will be very tasty now, but will crisp up a lot more once cooled.
Baking method
While the nuts are cooking, preheat the oven to 350 °F (176 °C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Once the nuts are glazed, transfer them to a big bowl, add the spice mix, and toss to cover evenly. Transfer onto the lined baking sheet and spread into one layer.
Bake until golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Check on the nuts after 10 minutes. If they haven’t turned dark amber, let them bake a bit longer.
Once done, transfer the walnuts onto a tray to cool before serving. The nuts will crisp up once cooled completely.
Serve & Store
These candied walnuts are perfect for holiday gifting, topping on your salad, or simply serving as a snack.
Once completely cooled, store the candied walnuts in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 weeks. They taste the best when fresh (the first 3 to 5 days) and will remain crispy throughout the storage. If you plan to store the walnuts for longer, put a few layers of paper towel on the bottom of the container to collect any extra oil and moisture.",en-US,"{'servingSize': '1 serving', 'calories': '249 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '16.8 g', 'proteinContent': '5.1 g', 'fatContent': '20.1 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '2 g', 'sodiumContent': '291 mg', 'fiberContent': '2.1 g', 'sugarContent': '12.6 g'}",-1.0,,Omnivore's Cookbook,60,8 serving(s)

Warm milk to approximately 100-110°F (38°C), about 30 seconds in the microwave. The milk should be warm, just a bit above body temperature. Add 1 teaspoon of sugar and the active dry yeast. Let sit for 5 minutes so the yeast will activate.
While the yeast activates, combine the flour, salt, and remaining sugar in the bowl of your mixer.
Once the yeast is activated, you should see bubbles on the surface of the mixture. Pour it onto the flour mixture. Add the heavy cream, egg, butter, and sesame paste. Stir with a spatula until everything just comes together (do not over stir). Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let rest for 20 minutes.
Install the dough hook on your mixer (I used a KitchenAid). Start at low speed, then gradually increase to setting 6 out of 10. Knead for 10 to 12 minutes, until the dough is very smooth. Test the dough by pulling a piece of it using both of your hands. It should stretch into a very thin and translucent sheet. The dough should be soft, a bit sticky, but not stick to your fingers.
Grease a big bowl with a thin layer of oil. Place the dough in the bowl. Cover with plastic wrap. Let rise until the dough doubles in size, 50 to 70 minutes.
Prepare the filling
Prepare the filling while resting the dough. Combine the softened butter with the sesame paste in a small bowl. Stir until it forms a smooth mixture.
In a separate bowl, combine the brown sugar, cinnamon powder, and salt. Stir to mix well.
Assemble
Line a 13” x 9” (33cm x 23 cm) baking pan with parchment paper.
Punch the air out of the dough. Transfer it onto a lightly floured working surface. Use your hands to form the dough into a rectangle so it’s easy to roll.
Roll the dough with a rolling pin until it forms a 17”x13” (43cm x 33cm) rectangular sheet. Use a dough cutter or a knife to slice off the irregular edges and discard.
Add the butter sesame paste mixture onto the dough. Use the back of a spoon to spread it out into a thin, even layer. Make sure to leave a thin gap on the top of the long edge without the paste, so it won't spill when you roll up the dough.
Sprinkle the cinnamon sugar mixture evenly over the sesame paste.
Starting at the top of the long side (17” / 43cm), tightly roll the dough towards yourself into a long log. Once fully rolled, make sure the seam is tableside down. Press gently to seal.
Use a sharp knife to cut the dough. Slice off the irregular part on both edges and discard the dough. Score the roll, once in the center, then in the center of the two halves, then 3 times between each quarter. Slice along the scored lines, making 12 cinnamon rolls. Transfer the cinnamon rolls onto the parchment paper, evenly spaced, in a 4 by 3 array.
Cover the baking pan with plastic wrap. Let rise again for 30 minutes.
Bake & garnish
Preheat the oven to 350° F (176° C). Bake the cinnamon rolls on the middle rack for 25 minutes. The top of the cinnamon rolls should turn golden brown, and the inside fully cooked.
Prepare the glaze while the rolls are baking. Whisk together the confectioners sugar, milk, and sesame paste in a small bowl, until it forms a runny glaze.
Once the cinnamon rolls are baked, let rest for 5 minutes. Drizzle the glaze on top of the rolls.
Serve and store
I highly recommend serving the cinnamon rolls when they’re fresh out of the oven and still warm. At this point, they’re super soft inside and crispy on the outside.
Once cooled completely, you can store them in an airtight container on your kitchen counter for 1 to 2 days. Due to the very soft and moist dough, the cinnamon rolls will have dried out a bit by the second day. I usually microwave a roll for 10 seconds or leave it in a 350° F (176° C) oven to warm up before serving.
For longer storage, place the cinnamon rolls in a ziplock bag, squeeze out as much air as possible, and store them in the freezer for up to a month. To reheat, bake the cinnamon rolls at 350° F (176° C) without thawing, until warm throughout, 10 minutes or so.",en-US,"{'servingSize': '12 g', 'calories': '271 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '40.3 g', 'proteinContent': '5.3 g', 'fatContent': '11.7 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '5.4 g', 'cholesterolContent': '37 mg', 'sodiumContent': '151 mg', 'fiberContent': '8.4 g', 'sugarContent': '9.5 g'}",5.0,,Omnivore's Cookbook,160,12 serving(s)

While the dough rises, add the soaked jujubes and soaking water to a blender or an immersion blender cup. Blend until a smooth paste forms. If the mixture is too thick to blend, add water, 1 teaspoon at a time, until it’s workable.
Combine the 4 tablespoons of butter with the jujube paste in a small pot and light brown sugar. Heat over medium-low heat. Cook and stir until the sugar is melted and the syrup is smooth. Remove the pot from the heat and set it aside.
Make the coating
Combine the coating sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl, mix well. Pour into a medium-sized tray or a big dish.
Assemble & bake
Smear a thin layer of butter onto a 10"" bundt pan.
Preheat the oven to 350°F (176°C).
Once the dough has risen, punch it down, gently knead it a few times, and divide it into 4 even pieces.
Roll each piece into 4 long logs, about 1 ft (30 cm) long. Slice each long log into 15 pieces of dough, for a total of 60 doughs.
Grease your hands with a small amount of melted butter. Roll each piece of dough into a ball between your palms. Place each dough ball in the tray of sugar once formed.
Once the sugar tray is mostly filled, about half way through the rolling process, shimmy the tray to coat the dough balls with the cinnamon sugar. Roll the doughs with your hands to help coat evenly.
Distribute the dough balls throughout the greased pan. Sprinkle over a few pieces chopped nuts if using, and then drizzle a small amount of syrup.
Repeat steps 12 to 14 to fill the pan with coated dough balls, without pouring the syrup. Once all the dough balls are in the pan, cover with plastic wrap and rest for 20 minutes.
Just before baking, pour the rest of the syrup evenly over the dough (you can also reserve 1 to 2 tablespoons syrup to brush onto the crispy side of the bread if you wish).
Bake for 35 to 45 minutes. Check the bread after 25 minutes, and then at the 35-minute mark. If the surface of the bread starts to brown too much, cover the pan with a foil tent. Once done, the bread should be fluffy and golden brown on top. You can test the doneness by inserting a bamboo skewer and the skewer should come out clean.
Let the monkey bread cool for 10 minutes. Cover the pan with a large flat plate. Use one hand to hold the plate and the other hand to flip the pan. Remove the pan and now you can serve the bread.
(Optional) If you like the crispy side of the bread, you can flip the bread again and brush the reserved syrup onto the crispy side.

Matcha Cake,Maggie Zhu,https://omnivorescookbook.com/recipes/matcha-cake/,Japanese,https://omnivorescookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Matcha-Cake-1.jpg,"['2 teaspoons matcha powder', '4 egg yolks', '10 grams 0.35 ounces (about 2 and 1/2 teaspoons) sugar', '30 grams 1 ounce (about 2 tablespoons and 1 teaspoon) grapeseed oil (*see footnote 1)', '40 grams 1.4 ounces cake flour', '4 egg whites', '1 teaspoon lemon juice', '45 grams 1.6 ounces (about 3 and 3/4 tablespoons) sugar', '200 grams whipping cream (contains 35% butterfat)', '1 teaspoon matcha powder', '6 tablespoons red bean paste']","To cook the cake
Preheat oven to 160 degrees C (320 F). Line the bottom of each cake pan with two layers of parchment (see footnote 2). Grease the walls of each cake pan with grapeseed oil. Set aside.
Combine matcha powder, 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon of hot water in a small bowl, stir with a spoon until matcha powder is fully dissolved in the water. Add 2 tablespoons of cool water and whisk until matcha is thoroughly mixed.
In a large bowl, combine egg yolks and sugar. Whisk until the sugar is fully dissolved and incorporated into the egg yolk.
Add oil and whisk until fully combined.
Use a spoon to stir the matcha mixture several times, then add it into the large bowl. Whisk several times until matcha is mixed evenly.
Add cake flour and whisk until fully incorporated. It’s OK if there are some lumps in the mixture.
In another clean medium sized bowl, add the egg whites. Whisk with an electric mixer at low speed until the egg white starts foaming, about 1 minute. Stop mixer and add lemon juice (see footnote 3).
Mix at medium speed until the foam bubbles become tiny, firm and even, about 3 minutes. Add sugar slowly and mix at high speed until the mixture has a firm peak when you lift the mixer from the mixture. From here, you should move as quickly as you can in the following steps.
Add half of the egg white mixture into the egg yolk mixture. Use a whisk to mix gently, until the egg white is just mixed.
Add the rest of the egg white mixture and continue to mix, until fully incorporated.
Use a rubber spatula to fold the batter gently, until the batter becomes a consistent, pale green color without any obvious dark green spots.
Pour the batter into the cake pans. The batter should almost fill the pans. Bake on the middle oven rack for 20 minutes. Check the cake. If the surface turns brown, move the cake pans to the bottom rack and continue to bake until cooked through, about 10 minutes. Use a toothpick to pierce the middle of the cake. The cake is done when the toothpick comes out clean.
Remove cake pans from oven. Place two layers of wet towels or a trivet on the table. Drop each cake pan from 30 centimeters (12 inches) high onto the cushion two to three times. Doing this helps prevent the cake from shrinking significantly. Flip the cake pans and allow the cakes to cool upside down on a cooling rack.
When the cakes have cooled down, use a knife to separate each cake from the pan first. The cake should then come out easily when you flip the pan. Peel off and discard the parchment.
To prepare whipped cream
Add whipping cream into a large bowl and mix with an electric mixer, until it just becomes thick and can hold its shape. Add matcha powder. Use a whisk to mix by hand until the matcha powder is incorporated evenly. The cream should become thicker and not any obvious lumps.
To assemble the cake
Wait until the cakes have cooled down completely.
Add about 3 tablespoons red bean paste onto a piece of parchment and place another piece of parchment on top. Use your hand to spread the paste into a round shape, large enough to cover the cake. Uncover the paste and place the cake pan on top, to be used as a stencil. Use a knife to carve the red bean paste to the exact shape of the cake pan.
Place one layer of the cake on a working surface, upside down. Place the layer of red bean paste on top of the cake and carefully peel off the parchment.
Spread a layer of matcha cream onto the red bean paste layer. Place another layer of cake, upside down, on top of the first layer. Repeat the process, adding one layer of red bean paste and one of cream. Place the third cake layer on top, upside down. Use the rest of the matcha cream to frost the cake. Sprinkle matcha powder on top of the cake for decoration.
Serve the cake immediately after frosting.
For storage, cover the cake and store at room temperature after frosting. If you cannot find a container that is tall enough, you can store the cake separately and make the frosting immediately before you intend to serve it. Store leftover cake in an airtight container in the fridge, for up to 3 days. You can refer to these tips on storing a cake for longer periods of time, but I always prefer to serve the cake the same day I make it, for the freshest flavor.",en-US,{},5.0,,Omnivore's Cookbook,60,6 serving(s)

Gently rinse the dried lily flower buds, wood ear mushrooms, and shiitake mushrooms with tap water and transfer them into three bowls. Add 1/2 cup hot water to each bowl to cover. Let soak until tender throughout, 30 minutes or so. Once done, squeeze out the marinating liquid back into the bowls and gently rinse them with tap water again to remove any dust on the surface. Slice the shitake mushrooms. Cut the lily flowers in half. And chop the wood ear mushrooms into small pieces. Reserve the marinating liquid from the shiitake mushrooms and lily flowers for the gravy.
Prepare gravy
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the Sichuan peppercorns. Cook, stirring occasionally, until you can smell a strong fragrance and the peppercorns turn darker (but not black). Scoop out the Sichuan peppercorns and discard them (*Footnote 1).
Add the rehydrated lily flowers, shiitake mushrooms, and wood ear mushrooms. Cook, stirring frequently, for 1 minute or so. Be careful, the rehydrated ingredients might cause oil splatter.
Add the white part of the green onion and the ginger. Cook and stir for 30 seconds to release the fragrance.
Move everything to one side of the pan and add the remaining 1/2 tablespoon oil to the other side. Add the ground pork on top of the oil, then use a spatula to spread it out. Let the pork cook for a minute without moving to brown the bottom, then cut it into small pieces.
When the pork is cooked through, pour in the Shaoxing wine and scrape the pan to release any brown bits.
Pour in the light soy sauce and dark soy sauce. Stir to coat well.
Add the water and the reserved 1 cup of soaking water. And the chicken bouillon powder. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally, and cook for 2 minutes.
Meanwhile, dissolve the cornstarch in 1 tablespoon of water in a small bowl. Pour the cornstarch slurry into the pan. Stir to mix well and let cook until the sauce thickens. Taste the gravy and adjust the seasoning by adding a pinch of salt, if needed.
Serve
To serve, scoop the tofu pudding using a large spoon (the larger and flatter, the better) into two serving bowls. If too much liquid is pooling in the bowl, tilt the bowl carefully to drain off the excess liquid (it’s OK to have some liquid in the bowl). Ladle the gravy on top of the tofu pudding.

Heat the butter in the microwave until it melts completely. Once the melted butter is slightly cooled, add the milk, egg yolk, vanila, and sugar. Mix with a spatula until smooth.
Combine the flour, baking powder, and baking soda in another medium-sized bowl. Stir to mix a few times, then transfer it to the bowl with the wet ingredients.
Mix with a spoon or fork until a dough forms. The dough should be very crumbly. Use your hand to press the crumbs together until a thick dough log is formed (see picture in the blog post).
Transfer the dough onto a large piece of plastic wrap and wrap the dough. Continue shaping the dough once wrapped, so it forms a thick cylindrical log, about 2” (5 cm) in diameter.
Transfer the dough to the fridge until ready to use.
Make the bread dough
Add the milk into a small bowl and warm it to approximately 100-110°F (38°C), about 30 seconds in the microwave. The milk should be warm, just a bit above body temperature. Pour it into the KitchenAid mixing bowl. Add the sugar and yeast. Stir it slightly and let it sit for 5 minutes to activate the yeast. You can tell the yeast has activated when there are bubbles forming in the liquid and a strong yeasty smell.
Add the heavy cream, egg, bread flour, all-purpose flour, and salt into the bowl (add the salt at the end to prevent it from directly touching the yeast).
Install the dough hook on your KitchenAid. Mix at setting 2, until a dough forms, about 2 minutes.
Turn off the mixer. Add the butter to the dough. Use a spatula to smear the butter into the dough to prevent it from splashing. Turn the mixer to setting 6. Knead for another 14 minutes, until the dough is smooth and stretchable. During mixing, turn off the mixer and scrape the sides as needed to make sure all the butter is incorporated. Test the dough by pulling a piece of it using both of your hands. It should stretch into a very thin and translucent sheet.
Form the dough into a tight ball by pulling its sides to the bottom, then place back in the mixing bowl. Cover the top of the bowl loosely with plastic wrap and place it in a warm and humid part of your home. Allow to rise until it double in size, about 1 hour.
Shape the bread dough
Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.
Once the dough is rested, punch the dough softly to push the air out. Place the dough onto an unfloured working surface and knead it a few times. Use a bench scraper or a knife to cut the dough in half, then halve it again into four pieces, and cut each piece into four even pieces, so you get 16 pieces in total. For a more accurate result, you can weigh the dough so each piece is 62 to 63 g (2.1 to 2.2 oz).
Loosely cover all the dough pieces with plastic wrap and work on the dough pieces one at a time.
Pinch the ends of a dough ball into its bottom and place the pinched side down. Place your hand over the ball, forming a cage with your fingers and working the ball in a circular motion, applying light pressure with all of your fingers, until the ball is well rounded.
Place the dough ball onto the lined baking sheet. Repeat with the rest of the dough balls. Make sure there is 2” (5 cm) of space between each ball. Cover the dough balls with plastic wrap while you form the rest, to prevent the dough from drying out.
Once done, make sure the whole tray is loosely covered with plastic wrap. Place it in a warm and humid place. Let it rise for another 30 to 45 minutes, until the size doubles again.
Egg wash
Make the egg wash by combining the yolk, milk, and sugar in a small bowl. Whisk together until everything is combined.
Cover with plastic and place in the fridge. Chilling the egg wash will make it slightly thicker so it will stick better when brushed on the dough.
Shape the topping
Once the topping is chilled, unwrap it. Use a knife to slice off the uneven ends and discard them. Carve marks on the dough so you can slice the log into 16 even pieces (see the blog post for instructional pictures). Then slice the dough accordingly. If the dough is too hard to slice, rest it on the kitchen counter for 10 to 15 minutes to let it soften before cutting.
Place each piece between two pieces of plastic wrap. Use a rolling pin to flatten the dough without cracking it, until it forms a round disk that is about 2.5” (6 cm) in diameter and 1/4” (5 mm) thick. The dough will be very crumbly and the ends might crack a bit (it’s totally OK!). If you find the dough too difficult to roll out without cracking, you can use your hand to lightly flatten it instead of rolling it. (*Footnote 1)
Place the rolled/pressed topping disks onto a large sheet of plastic wrap using a thin spatula (you can also stack them together by placing plastic wrap or parchment paper between each piece of dough). Cover with plastic wrap until you’re ready to assemble the buns. (*Footnote 2)
Assemble and bake
Preheat the oven to 350° F (176° C).
Once the bread dough has risen again, remove the plastic wrap. Gently place the topping dough disks onto the bread dough rolls.
Brush all the buns with egg wash. Allow the egg to dry slightly. Then brush them again for a second time to get the beautiful yellow color.
Bake for 15 to 17 minutes, until the top is golden yellow and the bottom is slightly browned.
Let the buns rest in the pan for 5 minutes, then transfer them onto a cooling rack.
Serve warm or at room temperature.
Store
Once the pineapple buns have cooled completely, you can store them in an airtight container on your kitchen counter for up to 2 days. The rolls will stay delicious at room temperature. You can also warm them up in the microwave for 10 seconds or leave them in a 350° F (176° C) oven to warm before serving.
For longer storage, place the dinner rolls in a ziplock bag, squeeze out as much air as possible, and store them in the freezer for up to a month. To reheat, bake the rolls at 350° F (176° C) without thawing, until warm throughout, 10 minutes or so.",en-US,"{'servingSize': '1 bun', 'calories': '240 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '32.1 g', 'proteinContent': '4 g', 'fatContent': '11 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '6.5 g', 'cholesterolContent': '81 mg', 'sodiumContent': '213 mg', 'fiberContent': '0.6 g', 'sugarContent': '13.9 g'}",4.96,,Omnivore's Cookbook,150,16 serving(s)

Place pumpkin on steaming rack, skin side down. Cover pot and bring to a boil over medium high heat. Turn to low heat and steam until you the pumpkin can easily be pierced with a fork, about 15 minutes. Transfer pumpkin to a plate to cool.
Scoop the pumpkin flesh from the skin and add it into a large bowl. Smash into paste. The pumpkin yielded 340 grams (12 ounces) of paste in my case.
Slowly blend glutinous rice flour into pumpkin paste, about 2 tablespoons at a time. Whisk with a pair of chopsticks (or a fork), until flour is fully cooperated. Add more flour and keep mixing, until the flour becomes difficult to blend. Dust both hands with rice flour. Knead the dough together with one hand, until it forms a consistent and soft dough. The dough should be easily picked up by hand and should stick to the bottom of the bowl a bit. Pick up the dough and use both hands to press and knead the dough for another 5 minutes to blend the rice flour in well. The surface of the dough should be smooth and you shouldn't notice any stray flour on or inside the dough.
Put bread crumbs in a small bowl and set aside.
Blend peanuts and brown sugar in a medium sized bowl. Slowly add 1 tablespoon water and mix with a fork.
Divide the dough into 4 equal parts, then divide each part into 4 small pieces. Shape each small piece into a dough ball with both hands.
To make pumpkin buns: Hold a dough ball in one hand and use the other hand to press it into a flat, round shape, about 5 centimeters (2 inches) in diameter. Add about 1 teaspoon of peanut filling in the center of the dough. Wrap the dough around the filling and pinch the edges together, forming a ball again. Gently press the ball until it is shaped like a mini pancake, 1 - 1.5 centimeters (0.5 inch) in thickness.
(optional) You can use red bean paste instead of brown sugar and peanuts as filling for the buns.
Toss the buns in bread crumbs, and shake off any extra.

Add the milk into a small bowl and warm to approximately 100-110°F (38°C), about 30 seconds in the microwave. The milk should be warm, just a bit above body temperature. Add a pinch of sugar and the active dry yeast. Let sit for 5 minutes so the yeast will activate.
While the yeast activates, add the rest of the ingredients into your mixer bowl.
Once the yeast is activated, you should see bubbles on the surface of the mixture. Pour it into the mixer bowl. Mix with a spatula until the dough just comes together. Cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 20 minutes.
Install the dough hook on your mixer (I used a KitchenAid). Start at low speed, then gradually increase to setting 8 out of 10. Knead for 10 to 12 minutes, until the dough is very smooth. Stop the mixer in the middle and scrape the dough from the sides of the bowl. Test the dough by pulling a piece of it using both of your hands. It should stretch into a very thin and translucent sheet. The dough should be wet and a bit sticky.
Grease a big bowl with a thin layer of oil. Place the dough into the bowl. Cover with plastic wrap. Let rise until the dough doubles in size, about 1 hour.
2nd rise
Line a 9” x 9” (23cm x 23 cm) baking pan with parchment paper.
Punch the air out of the dough. Transfer it onto a lightly oiled working surface. Divide the dough into 9 even pieces by cutting it into 3 even strips, then further cutting each strip into 3 small pieces. Each piece of dough should weigh 68 to 70 grams.
Shape the dough one piece at a time. Tuck the dough onto itself by pinching the dough from all sides into the center using your fingers, creating a round shape. Then roll the dough in a circular motion with your palm against the table, until it forms a round ball. Place the dough balls onto the parchment paper, evenly spaced, in a 3-by-3 array.
Cover the baking pan with plastic wrap. Let rest again for another 35 to 45 minutes, until the size has doubled.
Bake
Preheat the oven to 350° F (176° C) while resting the shaped bread rolls.
Right before baking, gently brush a thin layer of milk onto the tops of the bread rolls.
Bake the milk bread rolls on the middle rack for 20 to 25 minutes, until the top turns golden brown. You can also test the doneness by inserting an instant-read thermometer into the middle of the center bun. It should register at least 190°F.
Let the bread rest in the pan for 5 minutes, then transfer it onto a cooling rack.

Add the water into a small bowl and warm to approximately 100-110°F (38°C), about 30 seconds in the microwave. The water should be warm, just a bit above body temperature. Add the sugar and active dry yeast. Let sit for 5 minutes so the yeast will activate.
While the yeast activates, add the cake flour and baking powder into your mixer bowl.
Once the yeast is activated, you should see bubbles on the surface of the mixture. Pour it into the mixer bowl. Mix with a spatula a few times, until the liquid is just absorbed by the dry ingredients.
Install the dough hook on your mixer. Start at low speed, then gradually increase to speed setting to 6 out of 10. Knead for 10 minutes, until the dough is very smooth. Stop the mixer in the middle and scrape the dough from the sides of the bowl.
Add the shortening. Knead on level 6 for another 5 minutes. The dough should be soft, smooth, and easily lift from the bowl without sticking to your hands.
Lightly grease a large bowl with butter or oil spray. Transfer the dough into the bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it rest in a warm part of your room, until the size triples, about 2 hours.
Prepare the custard
Prepare the custard while the dough is resting. Mix the cornstarch, all-purpose flour, and half of the sugar together in a small bowl.
Place the egg yolks in a large bowl. Stir a few times to mix the yolks.
Add the milk and the remaining half of the sugar into a small saucepan. Heat over medium heat. Stir occasionally to dissolve the sugar completely. Cook until it reaches about 120 °F/ 49 °C (no more than 150 °F / 65 °C). You might see a few bubbles here and there. If the milk starts foaming, it’s too hot.
While the milk starts to get warm, add the dry ingredients (from step 1 of the custard) into the bowl with the egg yolks. Whisk until it forms an even paste. Do not add the dry ingredients too early, because the sugar will change the texture of the eggs.
Add the warm milk into the egg yolk mixture, about 1/4 cup at a time. Whisk constantly until the milk is fully incorporated into the paste. Continue to add more milk, a 1/4 cup at a time and continuously stirring, until it forms a thin, smooth mixture and all the milk is added.
Return the mixture back to the pot (the one you used to heat the milk). Heat over medium low heat and stir constantly, until the mixture thickens, 5 minutes or so. Keep cooking and stirring, until you can draw a line on the bottom of the pot using a spatula. (Note, the custard will start to thicken suddenly, like a switch was flipped. So you should keep a close eye on it.)
Remove the pot from the stove immediately. Add the butter and vanilla extract. Stir to mix well.
Line a large, deep plate with plastic wrap. Place a large mesh strainer on top.
Pour the custard into the lined plate through the strainer to smooth out the texture. Use a spatula to press the custard through the strainer if any lumps remain.
Cover the custard with plastic wrap. Press the wrap against the custard, so it won’t form a skin once it’s chilled.
Chill the custard in the fridge until it’s cooled, 2 hours or so. Or in the freezer for 30 mins.
Assemble
Cut some parchment paper into 3” (7 cm) squares to hold the buns. You’ll need 16 squares.
Punch the air out of the dough. Transfer it onto a lightly oiled working surface. Knead a few times to make the dough into a round ball. Divide the dough into 16 even pieces by cutting it into 2 even strips, then further cutting each strip into 4 small pieces. Each piece of dough should weigh 27 grams. Use your hands to roll and shape the dough pieces into dough balls.
Wrap the buns one at a time.
Flatten the dough ball using your palm. Use a rolling pin to roll a dough ball into a round disc that is thick in the middle and thin on the edges, about 2.5 to 3” (6 to 7 cm) in diameter. Carefully remove it from the surface and place it onto your palm.
Place about a heaping tablespoon of custard onto the center of the wrapper. Press the custard into the dough to release any air bubbles within the custard. Use your other hand to gather the wrapper onto the top of the custard filling. The dough sheet will start to form pleats and retain its round shape.
Once done, place the custard bun onto one of the cut parchment squares, pleated-side-down, then place it on a plate. Loosely cover it with plastic wrap to prevent them from drying out. Repeat the process to wrap the rest of the buns.
Set a stopwatch (or timer) after wrapping the first bun, to keep track of the resting time. You need to rest the buns for 20 to 30 minutes before steaming.
Steaming
Depending on the size of your steamer, you might need to steam the buns in batches. What I usually do is prepare the steamer after wrapping half of the buns, so some of them are ready to be cooked as you work on the rest.
To prepare the steamer, add about 3” (7 cm) of water to the pot and heat over medium-high heat until the water starts to boil. Place the rested buns onto the steamer rack, leaving at least 2” (5 cm) in between, because the buns will expand a lot as they cook.
Cover and let steam for 10 minutes. Once done, remove the steamer rack and place it onto a trivet. Uncover the steamer rack carefully. Let the steam out and then transfer the buns onto a serving plate. Let the buns cool for 5 minutes before eating.
Cook the rest of the buns using the same method.
Serve and store
The custard buns taste best when they are still warm, but you can serve them at room temperature, as well.
Once the buns have cooled completely, place them in a sealed container at room temperature, if serving the same day.
You can store the buns for 2 to 3 days in the fridge. To serve, heat up the buns until warm using the microwave.",en-US,"{'servingSize': '1 serving', 'calories': '121 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '21.5 g', 'proteinContent': '2.8 g', 'fatContent': '2.7 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '1.2 g', 'cholesterolContent': '43 mg', 'sodiumContent': '14 mg', 'fiberContent': '0.5 g', 'sugarContent': '8.1 g'}",5.0,,Omnivore's Cookbook,230,16 serving(s)
Homemade Lotus Seed Paste (莲蓉馅),Maggie Zhu,https://omnivorescookbook.com/homemade-lotus-seed-paste/,Chinese,https://omnivorescookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/200820_Lotus-Seed-Paste_550.jpg,"['100 g (1 cup) dried lotus seeds', '70 g (1/4 cup + 2 teaspoons) sugar', '50 g (1/4 cup) vegetable oil', '25 g (1 tablespoon) maltose']","Prep
Rinse the lotus seeds, then cover them with 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water. Soak overnight (or at least 3 hours).
Once rehydrated, drain and discard the water. Split each seed open with your hands, then remove and discard the green core if it has one.
Cook the lotus seeds
Option 1 - Cook on the stove: Add the split seeds to a pot and cover with an inch (2.5 cm) of water. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce to a simmer. Cook, covered with the lid slightly ajar (to prevent it boiling over), for 1 hour. The seeds are done when you can mash them with a fork and the water is milky. Keep an eye on the water level, as you may need to add more during the simmering.
Option 2 - Cook in Instant Pot or a pressure cooker: Add the split seeds to the Instant Pot and cover with an inch (2.5 cm) of water. Cook at high pressure for 15 minutes. Let release naturally for 8 minutes, then use fast release.
Drain the cooked seeds and add them to a food processor or blender. Add 1/3 to 1/2 cup boiling water. Blend until very even and smooth. Transfer to a bowl. (*Footnote 1)
Cook the lotus seed paste
Add a quarter of the sugar and a quarter of the oil to a medium-sized stainless pan (*Footnote 2). Shake the pan so the sugar and oil spread out. Turn the heat to low and cook, swirling the pan occasionally, until the sugar turns a light amber color. Do NOT stir, which will cause the sugar to crystalize.
Add the lotus seed puree and remaining sugar to the pan. Stir until the sugars and oil are incorporated into the puree.
Raise the heat to medium-low and cook, stirring constantly, until the paste begins to dry, about 5 minutes.
Begin incorporating the oil, a quarter at a time. Keep cooking and stirring until the oil is fully absorbed into the paste.
Add the maltose (*Footnote 3). Stir and cook to dissolve it into the paste.
Continue cooking until the mixture is pulling away from the pan and comes together as one piece, 6 to 10 minutes. The cooking time depends on your heat level and how much water you added while blending the lotus seeds.
Remove the pan from the heat and let cool before using. The paste will thicken quite a bit after cooling down, which will make it easy to handle when you make mooncakes or other Chinese pastries.
Store
Store the fully cooled lotus seed paste in a sealed container in the fridge for up to 1 week or in the freezer for up to 3 weeks.",en-US,"{'servingSize': '1 serving', 'calories': '67 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '9 g', 'proteinContent': '1 g', 'fatContent': '3.3 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '0.6 g', 'sugarContent': '5 g'}",5.0,,Omnivore's Cookbook,590,400 serving(s)
Baked BBQ Pork Buns (Char Siu Bao),Maggie Zhu,https://omnivorescookbook.com/baked-bbq-pork-buns/,Chinese,https://omnivorescookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/200730_Baked-BBQ-Pork-Buns_550.jpg,"['250 ml (1 cup + 2 teaspoons) milk (, warm (~110°F) (plus 1 tablespoon to wash the buns))', '7 g (1 packet, 2 1/4 teaspoons) active dry yeast', '40 g (3 tablespoons) sugar', '5 g (1 teaspoon) salt', '400 g (3 cups) bread flour', '60 g (3 tablespoons) butter (, melted & cooled)', '1 egg', '4 tablespoons chicken stock', '2 tablespoons hoisin sauce', '1 tablespoon oyster sauce', '1 tablespoon sugar', '1 tablespoon Shaoxing wine ((or dry sherry))', '1 clove garlic (, grated)', '1/8 teaspoon five spice powder', '2 tablespoons cornstarch', '1 heaping cup (180 g / 6.5 oz) homemade char siu (, diced (or store-bought char siu))', 'Sesame seeds ((optional))']","Make the dough
Pour the milk into a small bowl and warm it to approximately 100 to 110°F (38°C), about 30 seconds in the microwave. The milk should be warm, just a bit above body temperature.
Add the yeast and a pinch of the sugar to the warm milk. Let the yeast activate for 5 to 10 minutes, until the mixture is bubbling and frothy.
Add the remaining dough ingredients into your stand mixer bowl. Pour the activated yeast and milk over everything. Stir a few times with a spatula to make a rough dough. Knead with the hook attachment on setting 6 for 15 to 17 minutes, until the dough is smooth and stretchable. Test the dough by pulling a piece of it using both hands. It should stretch into a very thin and translucent sheet. (This dough can be kneaded by hand, but it is a wet dough, so having a dough scraper for the process will be very helpful. Knead it for 20 to 30 minutes in this case.)
While kneading the dough, grease the inside of a large bowl with a thin layer of butter or oil.
Pull the dough into a tight ball using your hands and place it into the greased bowl. Flip the dough ball a couple of times so that it is fully coated in the butter. Cover with plastic wrap. Let it proof until the size has doubled, about 1 hour in the winter, or 30 to 45 minutes in summer. (*Footnote 1)
Make the filling
While the dough is resting, combine all the filling ingredients in a small pot except for the diced char siu. Mix until the cornstarch is dissolved fully.
Bring the mixture to a boil and cook until thickened, so you can draw a line on the bottom of the pot with a spatula, about 1 minute. Take the pot off the heat and let the mixture cool off. Once cooled, add the diced char siu and mix until it is evenly distributed.
Shape the buns
Once the dough has doubled, punch it down using your hand and form it into a tight ball. Cut the ball into 12 even pieces (approximately 62 g per piece). Cover the pieces you aren’t working on with plastic wrap to prevent them from drying out.
One piece at a time, pull and pinch the edges of the dough to the top until the dough is round. Flip the piece so that the pinched part of the dough is on the work surface. Place your palm and fingers over the ball forming a domed cage, move the dough in small circular motions while applying light pressure to seal it.
Once all the pieces are formed, you can begin filling them. One at a time, use your palm to flatten the ball, then gently spread the edges until the dough has a 4 to 5” (10 to 13 cm) diameter. You should keep the center a bit thicker than the edges so the buns will be shaped evenly once wrapped.
Place a tablespoon of filling in the center. Gather the edges over the filling and pinch them together to seal it on top. Flip over the bun and roll it in the same circular motion as before to seal, but be gentle so the filling doesn’t tear through the dough. (If a piece of pork starts to poke out or looks like it’s about to you can pinch the dough over the trouble area and smooth it out with your finger.)
Place the buns on a parchment-lined baking tray, at least 1” (2.5 cm) apart, and cover them with plastic wrap. Let the buns rise until they grow 1.5 to 2x in size, about 30 to 45 minutes in winter, or 15 to 20 minutes in summer.
Bake
Preheat the oven to 350°F (176°C). (*Footnote 2)
Gently brush a thin layer of milk onto the top of each bun. Sprinkle with some sesame seeds to garnish, if using.
Bake for 12 to 15 minutes, or until the buns are golden brown.
Let the buns rest until slightly cooled. Serve warm or at room temperature.
Store and reheat
Once the buns have fully cooled, you can place them in a large ziplock bag. It’s OK to leave the buns at room temperature for a day. Store them in the fridge for up to 3 days or in the freezer for up to 3 months.
To reheat the refrigerated buns, heat them in a microwave or a 350°F (176°C) oven until warmed throughout.

In a small saucepan, heat the sesame oil over low heat until it becomes fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the ginger to the pan. Cook and stir for another minute.
Add the Shaoxing wine, soy sauce, and sugar. Raise the heat to medium-low and let the mixture simmer for 1 to 2 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and set aside.
Cut a piece of parchment paper that is approximately 12x15” (30x38 cm) and fold the longer side in half. Cut the folded paper into a wide half-heart shape. Unfold the paper and now it should look like a heart shape.
You will need to arrange all the ingredients on one side of the heart, leaving enough space on the edges to seal the paper - place the Chinese broccoli in the center of one half of the heart, slightly closer to the fold crease and the rounded top. Drizzle half of the sauce and ginger over the Chinese broccoli.
Lay the fish on top of the Chinese broccoli. Drizzle the remaining sauce and ginger over the fish. Place the sprigs of cilantro on both sides of the fish.
Fold the other half of the heart over the fish side. Starting at the top of the heart where it is rounded into a point, begin folding 1” (2.5 cm) sections towards the center of the package, pressing down well with each fold to seal it.

Chinese Egg Cake (鸡蛋糕),Maggie Zhu,https://omnivorescookbook.com/chinese-egg-cake/,Chinese,https://omnivorescookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/201218_Chinese-Egg-Cake_550.jpg,"['4 large or extra large Pete and Gerry’s Organic Eggs (cold)', '65 g (1/4 cup + 2 tablespoons) fine granulated sugar (, separated to 25 g and 40 g)', '40 g (3 tablespoons) milk', '30 g (3 tablespoons) vegetable oil ((or other type of neutral oil))', '1/4 teaspoon vanilla', '65 g (1/2 cup + 1 teaspoon) cake flour', '9 g (1 tablespoon) cornstarch', '1 teaspoon lemon juice (or 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar (Optional) (*Footnote 1))', '6 ” (15 cm) Parchment paper ((*Footnote 2))', 'Electric Mixer']","Prepare the parchment paper
Prepare the parchment paper by cutting it into 6x6” (15cmx15cm) squares. Fold the square in half, fold again, and then unfold it, so it shows a cross in the center. Cut four 2.5” (6.5 cm) slits along the fold lines. This will help the parchment paper easily fit into the muffin tin to form a tall cup.
Prepare the egg yolk mixture
Preheat the oven to 325°F (163°C).
Prepare one large bowl and one medium sized bowl. Separate the eggs, placing the egg yolks into the medium bowl and the whites into the large bowl. Store the bowl with the egg whites in the fridge while preparing the rest of the ingredients.
Measure out the sugar and transfer 3 tablespoons of it into a separate small bowl. If you’re using a scale, measure out 25 g and 40 g sugar separately.
Beat the egg yolks with an electric mixer, and slowly add the 25 g (3 tablespoons) sugar. Mix until silky and lighter in color.
Add the milk, oil, and vanilla. Mix again until it’s evenly incorporated.
Set a mesh colander over the bowl. Sift the cake flour and cornstarch into the egg yolk mixture. Beat until just combined. Set aside.
Prepare the egg white mixture
Transfer the bowl with the egg whites to your working station. Add the lemon juice. Beat with the electric mixer, starting at low speed and gradually turning to high. Slowly add the sugar and whip until it forms stiff peaks when you pull out the mixer.
Add 1/3 of the whipped egg whites to the yolk mixture. Gently fold them in with a spatula. Once fully combined (it’s OK to have a few lumps), add the folded mixture back to the big bowl with the egg whites. Fold them in using the spatula.
Assemble the cake and bake
For ease of process, you can add the mixture to a piping bag. To do this, line a 1-gallon ziplock over a tall bowl or large measuring cup. Pour the egg cake mixture into the bag. Carefully cut off the tip of the bag when you’re ready to pour the mixture.
One at a time, place a parchment square in a muffin tin and press it down to fill the muffin cup. Pour in the batter until it just reaches the top of the muffin tin. Repeat with the remaining papers and batter.
Bake for 18 to 20 minutes, until the tops are golden brown. To test doneness, insert a toothpick to the center of the cake and it should come out clean.
Once done baking, carefully remove the cakes from the muffin tin and lay them on the side on a wire rack. This step will help the cakes cool without deflating too much. (*Footnote 3)
The cakes will weep, but to avoid full sinkage it is recommended that you take them out of the muffin tin and lay them on their side to cool.
Enjoy the cakes once cooled.
Storage
To store the leftovers, wait until the cakes cool completely, then transfer them to an airtight container. Store them in the fridge for up to 3 days. The cakes taste best freshly baked, but they will retain a very good texture for the first 1 to 2 days in the fridge, then they will gradually lose moisture.",en-US,"{'servingSize': '1 serving', 'calories': '88 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '10.5 g', 'proteinContent': '2.5 g', 'fatContent': '4.1 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '1 g', 'cholesterolContent': '55 mg', 'sodiumContent': '22 mg', 'fiberContent': '0.2 g', 'sugarContent': '5.7 g'}",4.5,,Omnivore's Cookbook,48,9 serving(s)

Combine the minced ginger and hot water in a small bowl. Stir to mix well and set aside.
Prepare the dough
In a large tall plate or a big bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, cornstarch, instant yeast and sugar. Stir to mix well.
Slowly pour in the warm water, a few tablespoons at a time, and mix with a pair of chopsticks (or a fork). Once all the water has been added, keep mixing and scrape off the dry flour on the side of the bowl, until it forms many small dough flakes.
Pour in the vegetable oil. Keep mixing with the chopsticks until the oil is absorbed.
Start kneading by hand while further incorporating the dry flour, until there’s no dry flour left in the bowl.
Transfer the dough onto a working surface. Knead for 15 to 20 minutes, until the dough is quite smooth and elastic and there’s no dry flour left in the bowl. It’s OK if there’s some unevenness in the dough, which will smooth out after resting. The dough should be quite tough and not sticky to the touch. Cover and seal the bowl with plastic wrap. Let rest until it doubles in size, 1 hour or so.
Prepare the filling
Add the ginger water, light and dark soy sauce, Shaoxing wine, salt, sugar, and white pepper to the ground pork in a large bowl. Beat with a pair of chopsticks or a wooden spatula in a circular motion, until all the liquid is absorbed and the meat is sticky. This process might take a few minutes. (*Footnote 4)
Add the green onions and sesame oil. Mix until they are incorporated. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Store in the fridge until ready to use.
Assemble the buns
When the dough has rested, transfer to a work surface and punch it down. Knead for 1 minute to deflate the air out completely, then form it back into a ball.
Cut the dough in half. Wrap half of the dough in plastic wrap and store in the fridge while working on the other half.
Poke a hole in the center of the dough you’re working with. Stretch the dough into a large oval by running your fingers along the inside of the hole in a circular motion. Once the diameter of the dough is about 1” (2.5 cm), tear apart the ring so it creates a long, thin strip.
Cut the dough strip into 12 even pieces by cutting it in half, then further cut each half into 6 pieces. Gently use a circular motion to round up each dough piece then flatten it with your palm. Cover them with plastic wrap to prevent drying out.
Work on one piece of dough at a time - take one dough piece and place in front of you. Roll it with a rolling pin in one hand, using the other hand to rotate the dough while rolling, until the diameter reaches 5” (13 cm). You should keep the edges thinner than the center, so the wrapper of the bun will be even once you make the pleats.
Place the rolled dough in your palm and add 1 tablespoon of filling in the center.
Start wrapping the bun by folding and pinching the edge over itself, in one direction, until it is almost sealed. Then rotate and pinch the top of the pleats to fully seal the bun. (View my video for more details)
Repeat with the remaining dough pieces to wrap all the buns. Keep the wrapped buns under a piece of plastic wrap to prevent drying out. Once done wrapping, let rest for 10 minutes. Once rested, you should cook the buns immediately. You can store the wrapped buns in a sealed container in the fridge for up to 1 hour before cooking.
Repeat the wrapping steps to wrap the other half of the dough.
To cook the buns:
Add 2 tablespoons of oil and carefully place 12 wrapped buns into a 9” or 10” skillet. Heat over medium-high heat until hot. Turn to medium heat. Cook, uncovered, for 3 minutes, until the bottoms are lightly browned.
Pour about 1/4 cup hot water into the pan, just enough to cover the buns halfway up. Cover the pan and cook over medium heat for about 8 minutes, until the water is completely evaporated.
Turn the heat to medium-low and cook for another 2 to 3 minutes. Turn the heat off and remove the pan from the stove. Let the buns rest with the lid on for an additional 2 minutes. Remove the lid and transfer to a plate. Repeat the steps to cook the rest of the buns.

Sift the water dough flours, sugar, and salt into the bowl of a stand mixer. Add the butter and ice water. Mix with a spatula until a rough dough forms. Place the bowl in the mixer with the dough hook attachment. Drape a piece of the dough over the hook. Turn the mixer to setting 4 and knead until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. Depending on the size of your mixer, it may be necessary to stop the kneading occasionally and lift the dough over the hook (*Footnote 3). To test the dough, stretch it into a thin semi transparent sheet and it should hold well. Knead in the mixer for a bit longer, if needed. Once done, cover the dough and rest for 10 minutes.
Make the oil dough
Combine the low-gluten flour and shortening in a medium-sized bowl. Mix and press it together using your hands, until dough shapes. Further shape and knead it on a working surface until uniform and smooth. Cover and rest for 5 minutes.
Make the filling
Divide your choice of filling paste into 25g balls. Flatten each ball into a 2.5”(6.5 cm) disc and place a yolk in the center. Gently press the paste around the yolk to cover the yolk completely. Try to press out any air bubbles and prevent from damaging the yolk. Once the yolk is fully covered, roll it between your hands to smooth it out until it forms a smooth ball.
Prepare the pastry dough (*Footnote 4)
Divide the water dough into 16 even pieces, 10 g per piece. Work on one dough at a time, use your hands to pull the dough towards the center, until it forms a ball. Pinch to seal the end and set aside. Always cover the dough with plastic wrap.
Divide the oil dough into 16 even pieces, 10 g per piece. Form each piece into dough balls using your hands and cover them.
Flatten a ball of water dough with your palm and spread it with your fingers so that the center is thicker than the edges, about 2.5” (6.5 cm) wide. Place a ball of oil dough in the center. Lift the edges of the water dough over the oil dough to wrap it and pinch at the top to seal it. Set it aside and cover it. Repeat with all pieces of dough.
Assemble
Preheat the oven to 350°F (176°C).
Take a formed ball, sealed-side down, and flatten it with your palm. Gently roll it into a 5” (12.5 cm) long strip. Flip it over so it’s seam-side up. Starting from the short side, roll it into a thick jelly roll. Turn the roll 90° and flatten it with your hand. Again roll it into a 5”(12.5 cm) strip and then into a jelly roll. Cover and set aside. Repeat with the remaining balls.
Beginning with the first roll you made, take a roll and press into the middle so the swirled ends are pressed out. Then fold the swirled ends into the center and press them down so that a flat disc is formed. Roll this disc out so that it is 5” (12.5 cm) in diameter. Place the filling in the center. Lift and stretch the dough over the paste ball to cover completely, and pinch to seal. Roll between your palms to smooth it out. Repeat with all the dough and cover all the dough pieces with plastic wrap as you do so. (*Footnote 5)
Line a baking tray with parchment paper. Place the pastries on it, at least 1” (2.5) apart.
Lightly beat the yolk. Brush a thin layer of the egg wash onto the tops of the pastries. Wait 5 minutes and brush with a second layer of yolk.
Wet your fingertip with water and dip it into the sesame seeds so the seeds stick to your finger. Tap the top of each pastry to decorate.
Bake at 350°F (176°C) for 15 to 20 minutes, until the egg wash turns golden and the pastries are cooked through and flaky. Once done, remove from the baking sheet from the oven and let cool for 15 minutes before serving.

Add butter and sugar into a big bowl. Use a hand-blender set on low speed or a wooden spatula to mix for 2 to 3 minutes, until it forms an even, white, and fluffy mixture.
Add the honey. Stir until it is incorporated completely.
Gather the mixture into a ball shape and use your spatula to divide it into two even pieces. Transfer one piece to another big bowl.
Add the black sesame paste into one bowl and add the Chinese sesame paste (or tahini) into the other bowl. Stir separately to mix well.
Add the flour and 1/8 teaspoon of salt into each bowl. Stir with a spatula until it forms a dough. The dough should be soft but maintain its shape. If your dough is too wet, add more flour, one tablespoon at a time, and mix with a spatula until incorporated. If your dough is too dry, add a few drops of vegetable oil and mix again.
Place a piece of parchment paper onto your working surface. Transfer one dough ball onto the paper. Use your hands to gently shape it into a rectangular block, about 5.5” (14cm) x 3” (7.5 cm) x 1” (2.5 cm). Wrap the parchment paper around the block so it’s completely covered while maintaining the shape. Transfer it to the freezer to chill for at least 20 minutes or in the fridge for 2 hours, until firm. Repeat the process to chill the other dough.
Assemble the cookies
Once the doughs are chilled, work on them one at a time to cut them into rectangular sticks. To cut the dough, slice it into 1/2” (1 cm) pieces, then evenly divide the pieces into long strips that are 1/2” (1 cm) tall and 1/2” (1 cm) thick.
To assemble, place three strips together, alternating the colors. Then place another three strips on top of the bottom ones, alternating the colors again. Gently press them together to form the checkerboard log.
(Optional) Spread the roasted sesame seeds onto a piece of parchment paper. Place the checkerboard log onto the seeds, one side at a time, and press gently so the sesame seeds stick the surface.
Wrap the checkerboard log with parchment paper again and chill for another 20 minutes in the freezer, until the dough doesn’t feel soft when you touch the surface. Or you can leave the dough in the freezer until you’re ready to bake. In this case, place the parchment wrapped cookie dough in a ziplock bag to prevent the dough from drying out. If the cookie dough is too hard to cut, let it rest on the kitchen counter for 5 to 10 minutes to soften before cutting.
Baking
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C). Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.
Transfer the fully chilled checkerboard log onto a cutting board. Slice it into 1/4” (0.6 cm) pieces, and place it on the lined baking sheet. Make sure to leave about 1” (2 cm) of space between the cookies. You might need to bake the cookies in two batches. Bake for 15 minutes, until the bottom is browned and the center sets.
Leave the cookies on the baking sheet to chill for 10 to 15 minutes, until they firm up and don’t fall apart when you lift them. Use a spatula to carefully transfer the cookies onto a cooling rack or a large plate without overlapping. Let cool completely. The cookies will firm up once they reach room temperature.
The cookies are ready now. You can also store them in a sealed jar or ziplock bag at room temperature for 5 days. If you plan to store them longer, layer the cookies on parchment paper without overlapping in an airtight container, placing parchment paper between layers. Freeze for up to 6 months. Thaw the cookies in the fridge overnight, then on your kitchen counter until they warm to room temperature before serving.
Enjoy the cookies with coffee or tea!",en-US,"{'servingSize': '1 cookie', 'calories': '79 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '8.3 g', 'proteinContent': '1.1 g', 'fatContent': '4.7 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '2.3 g', 'cholesterolContent': '12 mg', 'sodiumContent': '42 mg', 'fiberContent': '0.3 g', 'sugarContent': '3.9 g'}",-1.0,,Omnivore's Cookbook,120,40 serving(s)
