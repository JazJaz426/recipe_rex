Hokkien Prawn Mee Noodle Soup (Hae Mee),Maggie Zhu,https://omnivorescookbook.com/hae-mee/,Chinese,https://omnivorescookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/1901_Hae-Mee-Hokkien-Prawn-Mee-Noodle-Soup_800.jpg,"['4 tablespoons peanut oil ((or vegetable oil))', '3 lbs (1.4 kg) pork meat and bone for braising ((I used feet and shank), coarsely chopped (*Footnote 1))', '1 lb (450 g) head-on shrimp ((* Footnote 2))', '1/2 cup (40 g) dried shrimp', '4 cloves garlic (, peeled)', '1 onion (, coarsely sliced)', '2 tablespoons fish sauce', '1 star anise pod', '1 cinnamon stick', '3 dried chili peppers', '1 teaspoon white peppercorns', '2 tablespoons sugar', '1 lb yellow noodles ((or rice noodle sticks, or rice vermicelli))', '4 cups (4 oz) water spinach ((or spinach))', '2 cups (4 oz) bean sprouts', '4 fishcakes', '1 tablespoon soy sauce, or to taste ((Optional))', 'Fried shallots, for garnish ((Optional))', 'Sambal oelek sauce ((Optional))']","Prepare the stock
Add 2 tablespoons oil to a large nonstick pan (or cast iron pan) and heat over medium heat until hot. Add the pork parts. Let cook for 4 to 5 minutes without touching, until the bottom is browned. Flip to brown the other side. It will take 10 to 15 minutes for the whole browning process.
Transfer the browned pork to a 6-quart (5.5-liter) dutch oven (or a heavy-duty pot). Add 10 cups cold tap water to the pot. Cook covered until boiling. Use a fine sieve to skim the brown bits from the top of the soup and discard them.
While boiling the broth, prepare the rest of the ingredients. Combine the dried shrimp with 1 cup warm water. Let rehydrate for 15 minutes or until soft.
Separate the heads of the fresh shrimp from the bodies and peel the shrimp. Reserve the brown bits coming from the heads when you seperate them. This is the best part and adds tons of flavor to the soup. Transfer the shrimp heads to a small bowl, and the rest of the shrimp meat to a container. Store the shrimp meat in the fridge until ready to use (or in the freezer if you plan to serve the noodle soup more than a day from now).
Add 1 tablespoon oil to the same nonstick pan you used to brown the pork. Heat over medium heat until hot. Add the shrimp heads. Cook until both sides turn a deep red color. Transfer heads to the stock pot. Add a ladle of water to the pan you cooked the shrimp in. Scrape off any brown bits stuck on the bottom and pour that water into the stock pot.
Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil, onion, and garlic to the same nonstick pan. Stir and cook until the edges turns golden brown. Transfer the onion and garlic to the stock pot.
Add the rehydrated shrimp to the nonstick pan. Add a bit more oil if the pan looks too dry. Stir and cook until slightly browned. Transfer the shrimp to the stock pot.
Add the fish sauce, star anise, cinnamon stick, dried chili peppers, white peppercorns, and sugar to the pot. Turn to low heat, cover, and simmer for 2 hours.
Once done, strain the soup by setting up a big bowl (or container) with a fine sieve on the top. Ladle the soup into the bowl through the sieve, a few cups at a time. Use the back of your ladle or a pair of tongs to press the solid ingredients in the sieve, to extract any residual liquid trapped in the veggies and shrimp heads. Discard the all the solid ingredients once done straining.
Taste the soup and adjust the flavor by adding soy sauce or salt. The soup should taste a bit salty by itself, because most of the ingredients in the noodle bowl will be boiled and not seasoned.
Now you can use the soup base to make noodle soup, or store it in the fridge or freezer until read to use. Set the stove on lowest heat to keep the soup hot if you’re going to assemble and serve the bowls immediately.
To prepare the noodle bowls
Bring a big pot of water to a boil. Blanch spinach for just 20 to 30 seconds, until tender. Transfer the spinach to a plate using a slotted ladle. Set aside.
Blanch the bean sprouts the same way, until slightly tender and still crunchly. Drain and set aside with the spinach.
Add the noodles into the same pot of water. Cook according to the instructions. Transfer to a colander, rinse with tap water and drain. Set aside.
Add the peeled shrimp to the boiling water. Cook until the shrimp begin to curl and are just cooked through, 1 to 2 minutes, depending on the size. Drain and set aside.
If you stored the soup base in the fridge, heat it until hot in the microwave or a pot on the stovetop.
Assemble the bowls
Divide noodles into 4 big bowls. Ladle the soup to cover the noodles. Add the boiled shrimp, fish cakes, bean sprouts, and spinach on top. Garnish with fried shallots, if using.
Serve the noodles hot with sambal sauce (or any other hot sauce you prefer), more fried shallots, soy sauce, and salt all on the side. This way your guests can season their noodle bowls according to their individual preferences.

Transfer the whole tomatoes into a colander placed on a large bowl to drain the extra liquid. You can save the liquid to use later (see the last paragraph in the post to make a sweet and sour soup base, in a dish such as this tomato sauce fried noodles, or use it in various dishes). While draining the tomatoes, you can start to prepare the dumpling filling.
Remove the seeds from the tomatoes. Gently squeeze them to remove extra moisture. This process is very important, so the wontons won’t end up watery.
Finely dice 5 of the tomatoes to 2/3-cm (1/4-inch) pieces. Coarsely chop the rest of the tomatoes, and transfer them into another bowl for the egg drop soup later.
Make wontons
Combine ground beef, green onion, light soy sauce, Sichuan peppercorns, ginger, and sugar in a large bowl. Stir to mix well. Let marinate for 5 to 10 minutes.
When you’re ready to wrap the wontons, add the 5 diced whole peeled tomatoes, salt, and sesame oil into the bowl with the beef (*see footnote 3). Mix well with a spatula.
Prepare a small bowl of water. Prepare a tray or a large airtight container (one you can store in the freezer), and spray a thin layer of oil onto it. This will prevent wontons from sticking to the bottom.
Work on the wontons one by one.
Place 1 teaspoon of filling onto the center of the wonton wrapper (*see footnote 4). Wet the edge of the wrapper with your finger. Fold the wonton so it forms a triangle. Squeeze as much air as possible from the wonton, and press the edge to seal. Place completed wonton onto the tray (or container).
When you’ve finished wrapping 20 wontons, seal the tray and store it in the freezer. This process keeps the wontons fresh and prevents drying out.
Tomato egg drop soup
Add chicken stock into a pot and bring to a boil. Add the chopped whole tomatoes.
When the stock starts to simmer again, turn to low heat. Put a spatula (or a fork) against one end of the bowl with the egg in it. Slowly drizzle egg into the soup in a swirling motion. Mix the soup and taste it with a small spoon (be careful, the soup is very hot!). Add salt to adjust seasoning, if necessary.
Turn to lowest heat to keep the soup warm.
Cook wontons
Now, you should have two batches of wontons, 20 frozen and the rest fresh. Cook them separately, fresh first.
(Option 1) Wonton soup (*see footnote 5) - Bring a large pot of water to a boil over medium high heat. Add wontons one by one. Gently stir with a ladle to prevent sticking. Cook until the wontons are floating on top and start to inflate like balloons. Remove a wonton and carefully taste it to see whether it’s cooked through. If yes, transfer wontons to each serving bowl. Add the tomato egg drop soup. Garnish with cilantro, if using. Serve immediately.
(Option 2) Pan-fried wontons - Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large nonstick pan over medium high heat until hot. Place wontons into the pan. Add 2 to 3 tablespoons water and cover immediately. Turn to medium heat. Let steam for 2 to 3 minutes (you will need more time if you made larger dumplings, or if you’re cooking with frozen wontons), or until the bottom turns golden. Remove a wonton and carefully taste it to see whether it’s cooked through. If yes, transfer the wontons to a large plate.

Gently rinse the dried lily flower buds, wood ear mushrooms, and shiitake mushrooms with tap water and transfer them into three bowls. Add 1/2 cup hot water to each bowl to cover. Let soak until tender throughout, 30 minutes or so. Once done, squeeze out the marinating liquid back into the bowls and gently rinse them with tap water again to remove any dust on the surface. Slice the shitake mushrooms. Cut the lily flowers in half. And chop the wood ear mushrooms into small pieces. Reserve the marinating liquid from the shiitake mushrooms and lily flowers for the gravy.
Prepare gravy
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the Sichuan peppercorns. Cook, stirring occasionally, until you can smell a strong fragrance and the peppercorns turn darker (but not black). Scoop out the Sichuan peppercorns and discard them (*Footnote 1).
Add the rehydrated lily flowers, shiitake mushrooms, and wood ear mushrooms. Cook, stirring frequently, for 1 minute or so. Be careful, the rehydrated ingredients might cause oil splatter.
Add the white part of the green onion and the ginger. Cook and stir for 30 seconds to release the fragrance.
Move everything to one side of the pan and add the remaining 1/2 tablespoon oil to the other side. Add the ground pork on top of the oil, then use a spatula to spread it out. Let the pork cook for a minute without moving to brown the bottom, then cut it into small pieces.
When the pork is cooked through, pour in the Shaoxing wine and scrape the pan to release any brown bits.
Pour in the light soy sauce and dark soy sauce. Stir to coat well.

Add bones, Shaoxing wine, and ginger into a large pot (or dutch oven). Add water until the pot is 4/5 full. Cover and bring to a boil. Stir the bones a few times during cooking to keep them from sticking to the bottom. Skim the foam from the surface until the soup turns clear, about 5 minutes.
(Optional) Turn off heat. Use a pair of chopsticks (or tongs) to transfer the bones to a plate. Place a strainer over a large bowl. Strain the broth and discard bones and other fragments. Rinse the pot to get rid of any extra foam. Transfer the broth and bone backs to the pot. (*see footnote 2)
Bring the broth to a boil again. Cover and cook over low heat (medium heat if using an electric stove) for 3.5 to 4 hours. The broth should continue boiling throughout the cooking. You don’t need to add water during the cooking, but remember to check the broth every 20 to 30 minutes. If the water runs too low and no longer covers the bones, add boiling water, 2 cups at a time. Don’t add any water during the final hour of cooking.
At the end of cooking, the broth should be reduced to about 1/3 (or less) of the original volume. Transfer the pork stock to a bowl to cool off.
(Optional) If the bones have any meat attached, you can separate the meat from the bones and eat it with a dipping sauce. To making the dipping sauce, combine 1 tablespoon light soy sauce with 1 teaspoon sugar. The meat will still be tender and moist and should be consumed as soon as possible. Or, you can store the meat and use it to cook fried rice later on.
(Optional) Leave the bones in the pot and cook another batch of stock. Add water until the pot is 1/2 full. Bring the water to a boil. Cover and cook for another 2 hours to get more stock. The broth should get quite concentrated again, but won’t be as thick as the first time. You can use this broth to cook soup directly, without adding water. To store, transfer the second batch of broth to a bowl to cool off. Discard ginger and pork bones.
You can use the stock to make soup and noodle broth and add it to stews and stir-fry dishes to enhance the flavor.

While simmering the beef tendon, prepare beef plate. Add beef plate into a large pot and add water to cover the meat. Bring to a boil over high heat. Turn to medium-low heat and keep a gentle boil going for 10 to 15 minutes. While boiling, skim the foam from the top of the broth and discard it. Turn off heat. Use a colander to transfer beef to a wok (or a large dutch oven). Let the soup sit about 10 minutes, then pour the soup into the wok until it covers the beef completely. (There may be some clotted blood on the bottom of pot. Try to avoid pouring it into wok.) Save the rest of the soup in the pot and set it aside for later use.
Heat the wok over medium heat. Add Shaoxing wine, chili pepper, ginger, scallion, bay leaves and black pepper (* see footnote) into wok and simmer, covered, for about 40 minutes. The beef tendon should be ready at that point.
Transfer beef tendon from the pressure cooker to the wok, and discard the broth.
Add curry powder, sugar and tomato paste into wok and mix well. Simmer, covered, for about 30 minutes, until beef starts to become more tender.
Add dark soy sauce, light soy sauce and salt into the wok. Mix well and simmer, covered, for one hour to one hour and a half (simmer time varies depending on the cut of beef). While simmering, stir the beef several times. Scoop the beef from the bottom with a spatula, to avoid burning it on the bottom of the pot.
After 20 minutes, watch the beef more closely and adjust the seasoning. If the liquid is becoming thick, but the beef is still tough, add more broth (from step 2), half a cup at a time. The liquid should be able to cover half of the beef. However, do not add too much water at the end of simmering, when beef is already soft.
When simmering has finished, adjust the seasoning again. The beef should be very tender and the soup quite thick. If the soup is not thick enough, boil uncovered over medium heat. Stand near the wok and stir constantly until soup thickens.
Serve warm with steamed rice.
The beef stew will stay good in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week, or in the freezer for up to a month.
To store the beef stew for your lunchbox or dinner during the next two weeks, place stew in a small bowl (2 to 4 servings per bowl) and set aside. After the stew has cooled down to room temperature, cover with plastic wrap and place in refrigerator, until stew has congealed and can easily be easily taken from the bowl. Store the blocks of stew in individual ziplock bags in the freezer.
To make a one-dish meal, you could add beans, potato, tomato, carrot or broccoli into the stew and boil them together, until the vegetables are cooked through.",en-US,"{'servingSize': '169 g', 'calories': '299 kcal', 'sugarContent': '1.2 g', 'sodiumContent': '691 mg', 'fatContent': '13.2 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '4.9 g', 'carbohydrateContent': '2.5 g', 'fiberContent': '0.6 g', 'proteinContent': '42.3 g', 'cholesterolContent': '111 mg'}",5.0,,Omnivore's Cookbook,240,18 serving(s)

Add 2 tablespoons water, mix until water is fully incorporated. Blend in cornstarch and mix until the ground pork becomes pasty.
Prepare winter melon. Use a knife to slice the rind off and discard it. Divide melon into 4 equal parts, then further into 8 parts. Cut off the inner soft part and discard it. Flip the winter melon so that it’s skin side down, and slice along the cut side to make evenly thick pieces.
Add pork broth to a medium-sized pot and bring to a boil. Turn to low heat. Use a spoon to scoop about 1 tablespoon of the ground pork mixture to shape it into a ball, and add it to the soup. Make the meatballs one at a time. After the last meatball is added, stir the soup gently 2 to 3 times. Immediately transfer all the meatballs to a plate and set aside. The meatballs should be cooked on the outside but still raw inside.
Transfer the winter melon to the pot. Bring the soup to a boil over high heat. Turn to medium heat and boil until the winter melon is almost cooked through, 5 to 8 minutes. You can try a piece of winter melon; if the texture has begun to turn soft, it’s cooked.
Add meatballs back into the soup. Bring the soup back to a boil and cook for 1 minute. Turn off heat, cover, and allow soup to sit for another 5 minutes. Add the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt or to taste, and mix well.

Place butternut squash cut side up on a baking tray. Drizzle with oil, sprinkle with salt and pepper. Bake for 70 to 90 minutes, or until it is very tender and the surface is caramelized. You can test this by inserting a skewer to the thickest part, if there is no resistance it’s done. It is better to slightly overcook the squash instead of undercook.
Make pumpkin puree in two batches. Scoop out seeds and discard. Scoop out squash meat from half of the squash, transfer to a food processor or a blender. You can use a pot and a immersion blender as well.
Add half of the ginger and 1/3 can of coconut milk. Blend until smooth. Adjust consistency and flavor with water and/or coconut milk until desired texture. (*footnote 1)
Puree the other half of squash by using the same method.
You can serve the soup hot or cold. Either way is tasty.
To reheat the soup, pour in a small pot and cook over low heat. Stir occasionally to prevent from scorching the bottom. You might need to add a bit water from time to time.
To save the soup and serve later, transfer the puree to a container to cool.

Without a food processor: Combine ground pork, shrimp, ginger, green onion, soy sauce, Shaoxing wine, salt and sesame oil in a big bowl. Mix well with a fork until everything combines well together and the mixture feels a bit sticky.
With a food processor or a blender: coarsely chop the ginger and green onion. Add all the filling ingredients except the shrimp. Mix until it forms a silky paste. Add the shrimp and blend again, until the shrimp are finely chopped but don’t become a paste.
Wrap the wonton
To make wontons, place a wonton wrapper in one hand, scoop a teaspoon of wonton filling and place it near the narrow side of the wonton wrapper (you can add more filling to the wonton if you like, as long as you can still wrap it). Fold the narrow side over the filling, then roll the filling all the way through the other side of the wrapper. Bind both ends and press together to lock the filling inside the wrapper. Brush a thin layer of water onto the wonton wrapper and press the ends together.
Make one wonton at a time, and line up all the wontons on a big wooden cutting board. If you aren’t going to boil the wontons immediately, use a damp paper towel (or cheesecloth) to cover the wontons to prevent them from drying out.
If you aren’t going to boil the wontons the same day, place them in an airtight container with several layers of wet paper towels on the bottom. This way, they can be stored in the fridge for up to 2 days.
(Option 1) Make the chicken soup base
Combine the chicken stock, ginger, and soy sauce in a pot. Bring to a boil. Let boil for 10 minutes. Turn to lowest heat to keep warm and start cooking wontons (see below).
Prepare 8 medium-sized bowls. Add the cooked wontons and bok choy. Add 2 tablespoons green onion, 1 tablespoon soy sauce and 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil into each bowl. Pour in 1 and 1/2 cups hot broth. Garnish with cilantro and chili oil, if using.
Serve hot.
(Option 2) Make the street vendor style soup base
To prepare 1 serving of wonton soup base, add a big spoon of cilantro, 1 tablespoon papery dried shrimps, a generous piece of dried seaweed, 1/4 teaspoon chicken bouillon, and some baby bok choy into a big bowl. Repeat the process to prepare the rest of the soup base in the other serving bowls. Cook wontons (see below).
To make 1 serving of wonton soup, use a ladle to transfer cooked wontons, bok choy, and the hot soup into a serving bowl with all the ingredients from the previous step. Drizzle 1 teaspoon soy sauce and 1 teaspoon sesame oil into the bowl and give it a gentle stir. The soup should be amber-colored. Add extra soy sauce or salt if the soup is not salty enough. Scatter green onion on top. Garnish with cilantro and chili oil, if using.
Serve hot.
Boiled the wonton
To boil the wontons, heat a big pot of water until boiling. Add 10 to 20 wontons at a time and boil over medium heat until wontons are floating on the surface of the water. Continue to boil until the wrappers are swollen, around 1 to 2 minutes for small wontons and 2 to 3 minutes for bigger ones. Take a wonton out with a slotted spoon and split it with a chopstick or fork. If the wonton is cooked through, stop heat immediately and transfer the wontons to individual serving bowls. If not, continue to boil until cooked through.
Once you’ve cooked the wontons, add the bok choy. Let cook until tender. Remove from the pot, drain well, and set aside.
To cook frozen wontons
Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat. Add wontons. Stir gently to prevent from sticking. Cook until bringing the water to a boil again. Turn to medium-low heat. Cover the pot with a small gap on one side, to prevent spilling. Continue boiling for 2 minutes (3 minutes for larger wontons). Stand beside the pot the whole time to monitor the broth. If the broth starts to spill, uncover and stir, and replace the cover. Uncover and continue cooking for another minute, or until the wontons are cooked through.",en-US,"{'servingSize': '1 serving', 'calories': '259 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '22.9 g', 'proteinContent': '21.6 g', 'fatContent': '9 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '0.8 g', 'cholesterolContent': '111 mg', 'sodiumContent': '1526 mg', 'fiberContent': '0.9 g', 'sugarContent': '2.2 g'}",5.0,,Omnivore's Cookbook,65,8 serving(s)

Thoroughly rinse the chicken with tap water.
In a large dutch oven (or pot), add chicken and fill 3/4 of the way with water. Add scallion, ginger, jujubes, and ginseng. Cover and bring to a boil over high heat. Uncover and use a ladle to skim the foam from the surface, if any has accumulated. Turn to low heat and simmer, covered, for about 3 hours. If the water level gets so low that the chicken is no longer covered, add 1 to 2 cups boiling water. Do not add water during the final hour of simmering. The broth will have a pale brownish yellow color with a thick layer of oil on top.
When the stock is done, transfer chicken to a working surface to cool down. Use a mesh ladle or slotted spoon to scoop out the spices, and discard them.
You can use the stock immediately or store it.
To use the chicken
After the chicken has cooled enough to handle, separate the meat from the bones with a knife or by hand. You can use the chicken in soups or stir fried dishes.
*Tip - To use the chicken meat: Season with salt and pepper. Coat with a thin layer of all-purpose flour. Grill in a greased skillet until crispy.
To store the broth
Transfer the broth to an air-tight container and allow to cool, uncovered. Do not skim the oil from the top. The oil will protect the broth from bacteria when cooling off. It also adds great flavor to dishes, whether used along with the broth or as a cooking oil. You can easily remove the solid fat when the broth has cooled down completely. Store the broth in the fridge for 2 to 3 days, or in the freezer for up to 3 months.

Sprinkle with 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt and mix well with your hand. Let sit for 10 minutes. Once done, use your hands to squeeze the water out of the watercress, as much as you can, then drain it thoroughly and mince it into very small pieces.

Work on the wontons one at a time. Place a wonton wrapper on your palm with a pointed end facing up. Add about 1 teaspoon of filling onto the lower third of the wrapper. Fold the bottom point onto the filling, and roll the filling upward. Use your fingers to press the dough on both sides of the filling, squeezing out as much air as possible. Dip your finger into a bowl of water, wet the wrapper on both sides of the filling, bend the two ends toward the middle so they overlap, then press them together to seal the wonton.
Place the wrapped wontons onto a tray and cover them with plastic wrap or a few layers of wet paper towel to prevent drying out.
Cook
Combine the chicken stock, green onions, light soy sauce, and garlic in a pot. Cook until bringing to a boil. Let simmer for at least 5 minutes.
While the wonton soup is cooking, heat another pot of water over medium-high heat until bringing to a boil. Add the number of wontons you plan to serve and make sure the wontons do not crowd the pot (the wontons should form a single layer in the pot without too much overlap).

Seal the lid and be sure to close the valve.

Use a ladle to skim and discard the oil floating on top. If you plan to store the soup for later, I highly recommend you fridge (or freeze) the soup at this point. It’s so much easier to skim the oil completely once the soup is chilled because the oil will clot into a white layer, separate from the soup.

Prepare a large tray or a plate, and a small bowl of water. Work on the wontons one at a time. Place about half a teaspoon of filling (or 1 teaspoon of filling for bigger wontons) on the lower third of the wrapper. Fold the bottom side over the filling, then roll the filling all the way across to the other side of the wrapper. Brush a thin layer of water on one end of the wonton wrapper using your finger. Bend both ends and press together to lock the filling inside the wrapper. Place on a big plate, a finger's width apart.
When you finish 10 to 15 wontons, cover them with a damp, clean cheesecloth or a few layers of damp paper towel to prevent them from drying out.
If you are not going to cook and serve the wontons immediately, you can keep them covered at room temperature for 2 to 3 hours.

Combine the minced ginger and hot water in a small bowl. Stir to mix well and set aside.
Prepare the dough
In a large tall plate or a big bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, cornstarch, instant yeast and sugar. Stir to mix well.
Slowly pour in the warm water, a few tablespoons at a time, and mix with a pair of chopsticks (or a fork). Once all the water has been added, keep mixing and scrape off the dry flour on the side of the bowl, until it forms many small dough flakes.
Pour in the vegetable oil. Keep mixing with the chopsticks until the oil is absorbed.
Start kneading by hand while further incorporating the dry flour, until there’s no dry flour left in the bowl.
Transfer the dough onto a working surface. Knead for 15 to 20 minutes, until the dough is quite smooth and elastic and there’s no dry flour left in the bowl. It’s OK if there’s some unevenness in the dough, which will smooth out after resting. The dough should be quite tough and not sticky to the touch. Cover and seal the bowl with plastic wrap. Let rest until it doubles in size, 1 hour or so.
Prepare the filling
Add the ginger water, light and dark soy sauce, Shaoxing wine, salt, sugar, and white pepper to the ground pork in a large bowl. Beat with a pair of chopsticks or a wooden spatula in a circular motion, until all the liquid is absorbed and the meat is sticky. This process might take a few minutes. (*Footnote 4)
Add the green onions and sesame oil. Mix until they are incorporated. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Store in the fridge until ready to use.
Assemble the buns
When the dough has rested, transfer to a work surface and punch it down. Knead for 1 minute to deflate the air out completely, then form it back into a ball.
Cut the dough in half. Wrap half of the dough in plastic wrap and store in the fridge while working on the other half.
Poke a hole in the center of the dough you’re working with. Stretch the dough into a large oval by running your fingers along the inside of the hole in a circular motion. Once the diameter of the dough is about 1” (2.5 cm), tear apart the ring so it creates a long, thin strip.
Cut the dough strip into 12 even pieces by cutting it in half, then further cut each half into 6 pieces. Gently use a circular motion to round up each dough piece then flatten it with your palm. Cover them with plastic wrap to prevent drying out.
Work on one piece of dough at a time - take one dough piece and place in front of you. Roll it with a rolling pin in one hand, using the other hand to rotate the dough while rolling, until the diameter reaches 5” (13 cm). You should keep the edges thinner than the center, so the wrapper of the bun will be even once you make the pleats.
Place the rolled dough in your palm and add 1 tablespoon of filling in the center.
Start wrapping the bun by folding and pinching the edge over itself, in one direction, until it is almost sealed. Then rotate and pinch the top of the pleats to fully seal the bun. (View my video for more details)
Repeat with the remaining dough pieces to wrap all the buns. Keep the wrapped buns under a piece of plastic wrap to prevent drying out. Once done wrapping, let rest for 10 minutes. Once rested, you should cook the buns immediately. You can store the wrapped buns in a sealed container in the fridge for up to 1 hour before cooking.
Repeat the wrapping steps to wrap the other half of the dough.
To cook the buns:
Add 2 tablespoons of oil and carefully place 12 wrapped buns into a 9” or 10” skillet. Heat over medium-high heat until hot. Turn to medium heat. Cook, uncovered, for 3 minutes, until the bottoms are lightly browned.
Pour about 1/4 cup hot water into the pan, just enough to cover the buns halfway up. Cover the pan and cook over medium heat for about 8 minutes, until the water is completely evaporated.
Turn the heat to medium-low and cook for another 2 to 3 minutes. Turn the heat off and remove the pan from the stove. Let the buns rest with the lid on for an additional 2 minutes. Remove the lid and transfer to a plate. Repeat the steps to cook the rest of the buns.
