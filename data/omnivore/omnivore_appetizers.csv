Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Turn to medium low heat and boil for 10 minutes. Skim the broth with a fine mesh strainer to get rid of the foam.
Add chili peppers, cloves, nutmeg, star anise, cinnamon, ginger, green onion, and Shaoxing wine. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then turn to lowest heat and simmer, covered, for 30 minutes.
Add light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, sugar, and salt into the pot and stir to mix well. Continue to simmer, covered, for an additional 1 hour. Skim off the oil from the top by using a fine mesh strainer.
Uncover, and continue to simmer for another hour or so, until the broth is reduced to about one fourth and has thickened slightly. Keep an eye on the pork during the last 30 minutes, because the broth can reduce very fast at the end and burn the bottom. You should have at least 1 cup of broth in the pot after reducing, in order to assemble the pork buns.
Assemble
Option 1 the modified style - Transfer one piece of pork belly onto a cutting board and slice it into bite-size pieces. Use a spoon to stuff the pork mixture, cilantro, and peppers into the bun. Drizzle a spoonful of broth onto the pork and add Sriracha sauce (if needed). Serve immediately.
Option 2 authentic street food style - Transfer one piece of pork belly onto a cutting board, cut it coarsely into small chunks. Place a handful of cilantro and a handful of peppers on top of the pork. Use a knife to chop and mix everything together. Use a spoon to stuff the pork mixture into the bun, drizzle a spoonful broth onto the pork and add a few drops of homemade chili oil.

Easy Sticky Wings with Hot Sauce,Maggie Zhu,https://omnivorescookbook.com/sticky-wings-with-hot-sauce/,Chinese,https://omnivorescookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/201015_201015-The-Eesiest-Sticky-Wings-with-Hot-Sauce_550.jpg,"['1 3/4 lbs (800 g) chicken wings ((12 to 16 wings))', '1/2 teaspoon salt', '1 tablespoon Sriracha ((or other hot sauce))', '1 tablespoon hoisin sauce', '1 tablespoon dark soy sauce ((or regular soy sauce))', '2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar', '2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil']","Arrange the chicken wings in one layer in a 12” nonstick skillet, skin side up. (Use two skillets if necessary.) Sprinkle the wings with half of the salt. Flip the wings over and sprinkle the other half of the salt onto them.
Cook the wings skin side down over medium-high heat, uncovered, until the bottoms are browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Shake the pan occasionally so the wings don’t stick. Check on the bottom of the wings every few minutes, to prevent them from overcooking.
Meanwhile, prepare the sauce by mixing all the sauce ingredients in a bowl.
Turn the chicken wings. They should be nicely browned on the first side. Cover the skillet, reduce the heat to medium-low, and cook the wings for another 12 minutes, or until they are browned on the second side and tender.
If the chicken wings have rendered a lot of fat, use a few layers of paper towel attached in front of a pair of tongs. Pat the pans between the wings to absorb any excess oil, and discard it.

Add flour to a large bowl and slowly blend in water. Use a pair of chopsticks to whisk the flour until the water is fully absorbed. Dust both hands with dry flour and start kneading, until dough forms.
Dust a working surface with flour and transfer the dough onto it. Knead the dough until the surface turns smooth, about 10 minutes.
Transfer the dough to a large bowl. Cover with a damp dish towel or plastic wrap. Allow to rest at room temperature for 30 to 40 minutes.
To make pie filling
While resting the dough, prepare the filling.
Cube lamb meat into 0.8 to 1 centimeter (0.3 to 0.4 inch) pieces and add them into a large bowl.
Add ginger, soy sauce, cumin powder, salt, and peppercorn powder. Mix well. Add peanut oil and mix again. Add cornstarch in 2 batches and mix by hand until the lamb is evenly coated.
Add onion and mix well.
To wrap the meat pies
Preheat oven to 220 degree C (430 F). Line a baking tray with aluminum foil. Spray (or brush) a thin layer of oil.
Add 2 tablespoons of oil to a small bowl and set aside.
Dust the working surface with flour again and transfer the dough onto it. Divide the dough into two equal pieces and put one piece back into the bowl. Cover well.
Dust both hands with flour and knead the dough several times. Roll the dough into a long stick and further divide into 5 equal parts.
Knead a piece of dough a few times to shape a ball. Press it into a round disc. Roll the dough with a rolling pin to flatten the disc to about 18 centimeters (7 inches) across and 2 millimeters (1/12 inch, like the thickness of a 1 dollar coin) thick.
Place 4 to 5 tablespoons of filling in the center of the dough disc. Brush a thin layer of oil onto the edge. Fold the upper and lower edges of the dough until they overlap each other. Fold the left and right ends so the dough seals the filling inside. Press gently and place onto the baking sheet.
Work on the rest of the dough in the same manner.
Spray (brush) each meat pie with a thin layer of oil on top and sprinkle sesame seeds to garnish.
Bake on the middle rack and bake at 220 degree C (430 F) for about 15 minutes, until the surface turns golden brown.
Let the meat pies cool for 5 minutes, then transfer a plate.
Serve warm as a snack or main dish.
To make pie filling
Follow the way above of cooking traditional meat pie. You could replace the cubed lamb leg meat with ground lamb. It’s easier to wrap with ground lamb.
To wrap the rolls
Place a sheet of egg roll wrapper on a cutting board (or working surface). If you are using a 15x15 cm sheet, use 2 layers at a time. Place 2 to 3 tablespoons of filling on the lower end of the sheet. Fold the sheet like folding a spring roll: fold the bottom first; then fold both sides to seal the filling; roll and tuck the filling; place it seam side down. (see footnote)
If you plan to freeze the rolls, place a baking sheet in an air-tight container and put the rolls on top. Do not overlap the rolls. Store in the freezer for up to 2 months.
To cook the rolls
Preheat oven to 220 degree C (430 F).
Line a baking tray with aluminum foil. Spray (or brush) a thin layer of oil on the foil.
Place the rolls on the aluminum foil. The side with more layers of wrapper should face down. (Otherwise the rolls will easily break apart during baking, after the juice seeps into the dough sheet)
Spray a thin layer of oil onto the rolls.
Bake on the middle rack at 220 degree C (430 F) for 10 minutes, until the surface turns golden. To cook frozen rolls, bake for about 14 minutes, until the surface turns golden.

Gently rinse the dried lily flower buds, wood ear mushrooms, and shiitake mushrooms with tap water and transfer them into three bowls. Add 1/2 cup hot water to each bowl to cover. Let soak until tender throughout, 30 minutes or so. Once done, squeeze out the marinating liquid back into the bowls and gently rinse them with tap water again to remove any dust on the surface. Slice the shitake mushrooms. Cut the lily flowers in half. And chop the wood ear mushrooms into small pieces. Reserve the marinating liquid from the shiitake mushrooms and lily flowers for the gravy.
Prepare gravy
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the Sichuan peppercorns. Cook, stirring occasionally, until you can smell a strong fragrance and the peppercorns turn darker (but not black). Scoop out the Sichuan peppercorns and discard them (*Footnote 1).
Add the rehydrated lily flowers, shiitake mushrooms, and wood ear mushrooms. Cook, stirring frequently, for 1 minute or so. Be careful, the rehydrated ingredients might cause oil splatter.
Add the white part of the green onion and the ginger. Cook and stir for 30 seconds to release the fragrance.
Move everything to one side of the pan and add the remaining 1/2 tablespoon oil to the other side. Add the ground pork on top of the oil, then use a spatula to spread it out. Let the pork cook for a minute without moving to brown the bottom, then cut it into small pieces.
When the pork is cooked through, pour in the Shaoxing wine and scrape the pan to release any brown bits.
Pour in the light soy sauce and dark soy sauce. Stir to coat well.
Add the water and the reserved 1 cup of soaking water. And the chicken bouillon powder. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally, and cook for 2 minutes.
Meanwhile, dissolve the cornstarch in 1 tablespoon of water in a small bowl. Pour the cornstarch slurry into the pan. Stir to mix well and let cook until the sauce thickens. Taste the gravy and adjust the seasoning by adding a pinch of salt, if needed.

Wrap dumplings
Prepare your working station by placing the dumpling filling, wrappers, and a large tray on your table. Fill a small bowl with water and set it aside.
Scoop about 1 tablespoon of dumpling filling and place it in the center of the wrapper. Dip your finger into the bowl of water and use it to wet the edge of the wrapper. Hold the dumpling with one hand and start sealing the edges with the other hand. After folding, press the edges again to seal well. You can use any method to fold the dumplings as long as you’re comfortable with it.
(Note, If you’re wrapping dumplings using homemade wrappers, you can add more filling, as much as you can handle, when you fold the dumplings. You also won’t need the water to wet the wrapper edge if you’re using homemade wrappers.)
Storage
Now you can freeze these dumplings if you don’t cook them immediately. Place them onto a baking tray and seal them in with a plastic wrap. You can store the dumplings in the freezer for up to 1 month. Once the dumplings are completely frozen, after about a day, you can transfer them to a gallon zipper bag to save freezer space.
Cook the dumplings
Cook the dumplings in batches.
Option 1 - Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a nonstick skillet over medium heat until hot. Add dumplings in a single layer. Cook until the bottom side turns golden. Add 2 tablespoons water and cover. Cook until the dumplings are cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes.
Option 2 - To get a crispier result, heat 2 to 3 tablespoons oil in a nonstick skillet over medium heat until hot. Add the dumplings in a single layer. Cook until the bottom side turns golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip the dumplings, add 2 tablespoons water, and cover. Cook for another 1 to 2 minutes, until the bottom turns golden brown.
Immediately transfer the dumplings to a plate. Cook the rest of the dumplings according to the same method.
You can serve the dumplings immediately with dumpling dipping sauce or a simple drizzle of Chinkiang vinegar.
Reheating
The best way I’ve found to heat up cooked dumplings, by far, is to use an air fryer. It crisps up the dumplings well without using any more oil. Alternatively, you can reheat the dumplings on the stovetop, using a nonstick pan with a thin layer of oil, covered.
Cooking frozen dumplings
The method is almost the same as cooking freshly made dumplings. But you will need to cook them covered for 2 to 3 minutes longer. I also add a bit more water, about 1/4 cup, to make sure it generates enough steam to heat the filling through.",en-US,"{'servingSize': '1 dumpling', 'calories': '44 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '6.8 g', 'proteinContent': '1.4 g', 'fatContent': '1.4 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '0.2 g', 'sodiumContent': '82 mg', 'fiberContent': '0.5 g', 'sugarContent': '0.6 g'}",5.0,,Omnivore's Cookbook,60,50 serving(s)

Place the dried shiitake mushrooms in a small bowl and cover them with hot water. Let them rehydrate until soft throughout. Gently rinse the mushrooms in the rehydrating water then squeeze out the excess liquid. Reserve the soaking liquid. Finely mince the mushrooms.
In a large bowl, add the ground chicken, green onions, garlic, shiitake mushrooms, 1 tablespoon of soaking liquid, shaoxing wine, salt, and sugar. Mix in a circular motion until it forms a paste that feels sticky, 5 minutes or so.
Add the panko and the egg, and mix again until everything comes together in one firm ball.
Roll balls of the mixture with the palm of your hand, about 1-2 tablespoons each. Set the rolled meatballs aside on a separate plate.
Combine all the sauce ingredients in a medium-size bowl and set aside.
Cook
Turn your Instant Pot to the “Saute” function and add oil. Wait until the indicator shows “HOT”.
Add the meatballs into the Instant Pot. Leave a small amount of space between each of them. Let them cook without moving, until the bottom side is browned. Flip to brown the other side. It will take a total of about 5 minutes. You may need to do two rounds of browning. In that case, take the browned meatballs out of the Instant Pot, allow the pot to get hot again, and add the next round.
Once all the meatballs are browned, turn off the saute function and put any meatballs you may have taken out of the pot back in. Stir the sauce to dissolve the cornstarch completely and pour it over the meatballs.
Seal the Instant Pot and make sure the valve is locked. Set to “Manual”, “High pressure”, and cook for 5 minutes. Once done cooking, press the “Quick Release” on the lid or switch the valve to unlock using a spatula (depending on your Instant Pod model).

Drain water from tofu. Place tofu on a strainer or a pair of chopsticks over a small bowl, set aside, and allow to drain for 1 hour. To save time, you can slice the tofu without straining and press each slice with a paper towel, trying to get as much water out as you can, in the process.
Slice tofu into 5 millimeter-thick (1/2 inch) squares. Place a piece of paper towel on top of tofu and gently press to drain extra moisture. Lightly season one side of tofu with salt and pepper.

Combine ground lamb meat, Shaoxing wine, light soy sauce, and dark soy sauce in a large bowl. Mix well until the mixture becomes a sticky paste. Add ginger. Sprinkle evenly with Sichuan peppercorn powder and salt (if you’re using it). Mix thoroughly. Add peanut oil and mix well. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside (or in the fridge if you’re not planning to make dumplings within an hour).
(option) If you are making your own dumpling wrappers, mix the ground lamb with the seasonings first, and set aside at room temperature for up to 1 hour (or in the fridge for up to a day). Do not add any vegetables to the meat at this point, because the veggies will be dehydrated by the salt, and the filling will become watery.
Right before you wrap the dumplings, prepare the vegetables. To mince the carrot and zucchini, you can use a mandoline to slice them into strips first, then chop them into small bits. You can also use a food processor to mince them.
Cook carrot. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a wok (or a nonstick skillet) over medium high heat until warm. Add carrot, stir, and saute until cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a plate.
When you’re ready to start wrapping dumplings, add green onion, zucchini, and carrot into the ground lamb. Mix well.
To wrap dumplings
{If you are using fresh homemade wrappers} Scoop about 1 tablespoon (or slightly less) of the dumpling filling and place it in the center of the wrapper. Hold the dumpling with one hand and start sealing the edges with the other hand (refer to the video or this post to see detailed information on how to fold a dumpling).
{If you are using pre-made wrappers from the store} Scoop about 2 teaspoons (or 1 tablespoon, depending on the size of the wrapper) of the lamb filling and place it in the center of the wrapper. Gently press the mixture into a round shape, so it will be easier to wrap. Wet your finger or a pair of chopsticks with water and gently brush water onto the edge of the wrapper. Fold the wrapper into a half moon shape. (*see footnote 2)
If you have trouble sealing the dumplings, reduce the amount of filling until you can seal it easily.
Place the dumplings on the working surface, one finger’s width apart. Work with the rest of the wrappers in the same manner.
You should wrap the dumplings in small batches, 20 to 25 at a time. After the dumplings are wrapped, cook or freeze them within 30 minutes. Otherwise, the dumplings will start to lose moisture. For more information on cooking frozen dumplings, refer to this post.
To boil dumplings
Bring a large pot of water to a boil.
Carefully add dumplings into the water, one at a time. Use a big ladle to stir the water gently and continuously, until the water starts to boil again, so the dumplings won’t stick to the bottom, for about 1 minute. Adjust the heat so the water is at boiling point, but isn’t bubbling too fiercely.
When the dumplings float to the surface, continue boiling until the dumplings are filled with air and swollen, and the dough starts to become transparent, about 1 minutes. Immediately transfer all the dumplings to a plate.
Be careful, the dumplings cook quickly and you should always stand beside the pot throughout the boiling process. When the dumplings are cooked, they will start to fall apart within seconds, so transfer them as soon as possible.
To cook potstickers
Heat a tablespoon of oil in a nonstick skillet over medium high heat. When oil is hot, place potstickers in the skillet, pleat side up.
Swirl 2 tablespoons water in the skillet, cover immediately, and turn the heat to medium. Cook covered until the water is evaporated and potstickers are cooked through, about 3 minutes.
Remove the cover and flip one potsticker to see whether the bottom side is charred. If not, turn to medium high heat and cook until the bottom side turns golden brown.
Transfer the potstickers to a plate.
To serve dumplings
Option 1: Serve with Chinese black vinegar and a few ginger slices.
Option 2: Serve with Chinese black vinegar and a few drops fresh Chili oil.
To freeze dumplings
If you plan to store dumplings or won't serve them immediately, always freeze them uncooked. It won’t affect the texture or flavor of the dumplings.

In a large bowl, combine ground pork, shaoxing wine and light soy sauce. Mix well with a pair of chopsticks (or a fork).

To wrap potstickers
Prepare a small bowl of water. Place a piece of parchment paper on a working surface or dust a wooden board with flour.
To wrap a potsticker, scoop about 2 teaspoons of the pork mixture and place in the center of the dumpling wrapper. Gently press the mixture into a round shape, so it will be easier to wrap. Wet your finger or a pair of chopsticks with water and gently brush water onto the edge of the wrapper (this will help the wrapper stick to itself when pressed together).
Fold the wrapper into a half moon shape, using fingers to pinch the middle and press the two layers together. Use your left hand to hold the dumpling and your right hand to fold 2 to 3 pleats in the outer layer towards the midpoint, and press it well to seal the filling inside.
Switch so that you're holding the dumpling in your right hand, and use your left hand to form more pleats in the same manner. Press the pleats again to seal the filling tightly. If you have trouble sealing the dumplings, reduce the amount of filling inside until you can seal it easily.
Place potsticker on the parchment paper. Continue forming the rest of the potstickers in the same manner. Leave about a finger’s width between any two dumplings, so they won’t stick together.
To mix dipping sauce
In a small bowl, drizzle vinegar over ginger slices. If the dipping sauce is not salty enough to your liking, you can add soy sauce to adjust the flavor, 1 teaspoon at a time.

Crispy Marinated Tofu,Maggie Zhu,https://omnivorescookbook.com/crispy-marinated-tofu/,Chinese,https://omnivorescookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/1911_Crispy-Marinated-Tofu_550.jpg,"['1 block (14 oz / 400 g) extra-firm or firm tofu', 'Optional 3 to 4 green onions, coarsely sliced to fill the marinade (*Footnote 1), reserve green parts for garnish', 'Vegetable oil for pan frying', '1/3 cup soy sauce', '1/4 cup shaoxing wine ((or dry sherry))', '2 tablespoons sugar', '3 tablespoons chili paste ((or hot sauce you like) (*Footnote 2))', '1 tablespoon hoisin sauce', '1 teaspoon lemon juice', '4 cloves garlic (, grated)', '1 inch ginger (, grated)', '1/2 cup cornstarch', '1/2 teaspoon salt (Skip the salt if using doubanjiang in the marinade)', '1/2 teaspoon cumin']","Marinate (4 hr to overnight)
(Optional) Press the tofu gently using your hands or a few layers of paper towel to get rid of excess water. Use this step if you’re short on time and need to use less time to marinate the tofu. You can skip this step if you’re going to marinate the tofu overnight.
Prepare a container that’s slightly bigger than the block of tofu. Combine all the sauce ingredients in the container. Stir to mix well. Transfer 2 to 3 tablespoons of the marinade into a separate small bowl to use as a dipping sauce later.
Cut the tofu in half lengthwise, then into half-inch-thick squares. Transfer the pieces into the container by making them “stand”, so it helps the marinade to disperse evenly (see the blog post above to see how to arrange the tofu). Use your hand to gently separate the tofu slices, so all the surfaces will be in touch with the marinade. If the marinade cannot cover all the tofu, use some green onion (or white onion) to fill up the empty space in the container, so the marinade covers most of the tofu.
Cover to seal the container. Gently shake it. Marinate overnight in the fridge or at room temperature for at least 4 hours.
Cook
When you’re ready to cook, remove the tofu from the marinade and lay it on a few layers of paper towels to drain the extra liquid.
Combine the coating ingredients in a plate. Stir to mix well.
Prepare a big plate with a few layers of paper towels, for the cooked tofu.
Heat a thin layer of oil in a nonstick (or carbon steel) pan over medium-high heat until hot.
You might need to cook the tofu in batches depending on your pan size. While heating up the pan, coat each piece of tofu with the coating mixture and place it on a plate. You should only coat the pieces you’re going to fry immediately.
Carefully add the coated tofu pieces into the pan. Cook without moving until the bottom is browned, 2 minutes or so. Flip to cook the other side until browned, another 2 minutes. Turn the heat down to medium if the pan gets too hot and the oil starts to smoke. Repeat the process until you’ve fried all the tofu pieces.
Transfer the fried tofu onto the paper towel lined plate to drain the excess oil.
Serve the fried tofu with the reserved dipping sauce on the side and garnish it with chopped green onion.

Honey Lotus Root with Sticky Rice (糯米藕),Maggie Zhu,https://omnivorescookbook.com/recipes/honey-lotus-root-with-sticky-rice/,Chinese,https://omnivorescookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1412_Honey-Lotus-Root-with-Sticky-Rice_047-550px.jpg,"['150 grams (5 ounces) glutinous rice', '2 teaspoons white sugar', '1 400 grams fresh lotus root ( (*see footnote 1))', '100 grams (3.5 ounces) rock sugar ( (or 1/2 cup white sugar))', '2 tablespoons brown sugar', '4 tablespoons osmanthus syrup ((or honey))']","Add glutinous rice into a small bowl and rinse it 2 to 3 times. Add water to cover rice with 1 centimeter (0.5 inch) excess. Let the rice soak at room temperature for 4 to 5 hours or in the fridge overnight (cover / wrap the bowl if placed in the fridge).
Drain the rice. Add white sugar and mix well.
Wash lotus root carefully. Peel the rind off and discard it. When you cut off the tough ends, be careful not to cut off so much that you reveal the tubes.
Cut about 2 centimeters (1 inch) from one end of the lotus root. Save the small piece that you cut off to use as a lid.
To stuff the lotus root with glutinous rice, add a spoonful of rice onto the cut end and use a chopstick to push the rice into the holes. Use a chopstick to squeeze the stuffed rice and compress it. Carefully fill up all the tubes, including the small ones. (It will take some time. I highly suggest you sit down and play your favorite TV show while doing this.)
Place the small “lid” back to cover the cut end, in exactly the position it originally was (so the glutinous rice will expand into the holes of the “lid” during cooking). Use 6 to 8 toothpicks to seal the “lid”. You should push the toothpicks as far in as you can. The glutinous rice will expand during cooking and the “lid” will fall off or be pushed apart if not sealed carefully.
Add lotus root to a small pot, with 2 cups of water to cover (*see footnote 2). Add rock sugar (or white granular sugar) and brown sugar. Bring to a boil over high heat. Stir during boiling to dissolve the sugar.
Turn to low heat, cover, and boil for 1 hour. Keep the water boiling throughout. Flip the lotus root after 30 minutes and add more water to cover it, if necessary.
Turn to lowest heat to simmer for another 20 minutes. Flip the lotus root 4 to 5 times during cooking.
To serve after cooking, transfer the lotus root to a cutting board and allow it to cool. Cut into evenly thick slices when the root is cool enough to handle.
To serve later, leave the lotus root in the pot until it cools off completely before slicing. If you plan to serve it the next day, place the lotus root in an airtight container and add the sugary water to cover. Store in fridge.
Drizzle osmanthus syrup (or honey) on top of the cut lotus root.

(150 g) purple cabbage (, coarsely chopped (yields about 2 cups))', '6 cups broth (, chicken or vegetable)', '8 teaspoons soy sauce ((or to taste))', 'sesame oil', 'chili oil', 'green onions (, coarsely chopped)', 'sesame seeds']","Spinach dye
Add baby spinach and 1 cup water into a blender (I used my Vitamix). Turn on blender and gradually increase to the highest speed. Blend until the spinach is completely broken down. Transfer to a bowl.
Once you finish this step, jump to the noodle-making process to make the dough.
Carrot dye
Bring a small pot of water to a boil. Blanch carrots until tender, 5 to 8 minutes. Drain and rinse with cold water to cool. When the carrots have cooled enough to handle, transfer them to the blender with 1 cup water. Turn on blender and gradually increase to the highest speed. Blend until it forms a smooth paste. Transfer to a bowl.
Once you finish this step, jump to the noodle-making process to make the dough.
Beet dye
Bring a small pot of water to a boil. Blanch beets until tender, about 5 minutes. Drain and rinse with cold water to cool. When the beets have cooled enough to handle, transfer them to the blender with 1 cup water. Turn on blender and gradually increase to the highest speed. Blend until it forms a smooth paste. Transfer to a bowl.
Once you finish this step, jump to the noodle-making process to make the dough.
Purple dye
Add red cabbage and 1 cup water into the blender. Turn on blender and gradually increase to the highest speed. Blend until the cabbage is completely broken down. Transfer to a bowl.
Noodle dough
Add the flour and salt into a high-powered blender or food processor with 2/3 cup of dye liquid.
Pulse until it starts to form a dough ball and lift off the blades, about 30 seconds. Add more dye liquid if the dough does not come together, 1 tablespoon at a time. Add a little more flour if the dough looks too moist. Pulse for another 20 to 30 seconds. Dust a thin layer of flour onto your working surface. Transfer the dough onto it and knead for 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer the dough to a bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let rest for 30 minutes.
Clean your blender (or food processor) before proceeding to the next color.
Noodles
Once you've made all the doughs, start making the noodles. At this stage you can cover the doughs with plastic wrap and store them in the fridge for a day, or freeze them for a month. Thaw completely before making noodles.
Divide each dough into four even pieces, shaping the four pieces into dough balls. Work on one piece at a time, returning the remaining doughs to the bowl and covering them.
Run the dough through a pasta rolling machine, starting on the widest setting and slowly working your way down to the desired thickness. My pasta machine has 10 settings. I usually use 6 for super thin noodles or 4 for more chewy noodles. Use the fettuccine attachment to cut the pasta into wide noodles or the spaghetti attachment for thinner noodles. Dust the noodles with extra flour to prevent sticking. Hang the noodles on a drying rack or a floured surface while working on the rest of the dough. If you do not have a pasta machine check out my Fresh Homemade Noodles recipe for instructions on how to roll and cut your noodles by hand (https://omnivorescookbook.com/fresh-homemade-noodles).
Cook and serve
Heat chicken or vegetable broth in a pot until boiling. You should prepare 6 to 8 cups of broth for each color.
Bring a large pot of water to a boil over medium-high heat. Only cook the portion of noodles you're about to serve.
Add noodles, one color (or 3 to 4 servings) at a time, and immediately stir with chopsticks (or tongs) to separate the noodles. Boil until the noodles are cooked through, about 1 minute for thin noodles or up to 3 minutes for thicker noodles.
Use tongs to transfer the noodles to a strainer. Flush with tap water to cool. Drain and transfer to serving bowls.
Add the broth to each noodle bowl, add 1 to 2 teaspoons soy sauce. Garnish with a few drops of sesame oil (or homemade chili oil), chopped green onion, and sesame seeds, if using.
Serve immediately.
Store
Dust the bottom of an airtight container with flour. Generously sprinkle flour onto the noodles. Fold the noodles into the container and cover. Store in the freezer for up to 1 month.
To cook frozen noodles, cook them like you would cook fresh noodles, without thawing. You'll need more cooking time, about 4 to 6 minutes depending on the thickness of the noodles.",en-US,"{'servingSize': '1 serving', 'calories': '163 kcal', 'sugarContent': '0.8 g', 'sodiumContent': '876 mg', 'fatContent': '1.4 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '0.3 g', 'carbohydrateContent': '28.6 g', 'fiberContent': '1.2 g', 'proteinContent': '7.8 g'}",-1.0,,Omnivore's Cookbook,55,4 serving(s)

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 C). Line a baking tray with parchment.
Press the water out of the tofu while heating up the oven. Carefully press the tofu with your hands. Slice the tofu into two even-thickness pieces. Wrap a few layers of cheesecloth (or kitchen paper towel) outside the tofu, and place a small tray with a heavy weight on top. The weight can be a jar of pickles or canned tomatoes.
When the oven is heated, cut the tofu into 1/2-inch (1-cm) pieces. (*Footnote 2)
Season both sides with salt. Bake for about 30 minutes, until the tofu turns golden and the surface puffs.

In a large bowl combine the all-purpose flour, salt, and sugar. Stir with a fork to mix well.
Microwave the water to approximately 180 degrees F (80 C). It should be too hot to touch but not boiling.
Slowly add the hot water into the flour mixture, stirring with a fork to mix the water into the flour.
Once all the water is added, work the water into the flour until it forms large doughy flakes without any dry flour left. Feel the flakes with your hand. It should be quite firm and not too soft. If there’s still a lot of dry flour left, add 1 more tablespoon of water.
Add the oil. Mix and knead with your hand until it forms a dough ball.
Transfer the dough ball onto a clean working surface. Knead by hand for 5 to 8 minutes, until the dough becomes firm. It is OK if the surface is not smooth.
Return the dough to the bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let rest for 30 minutes.
Filling
Prepare the filling while the dough rests. Combine the eggs, Shaoxing wine, and salt in a medium-sized bowl. Whisk until evenly mixed.
Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a medium-sized pan over medium heat until hot.
(Optional) Add the dry shrimp. Cook and stir until it turns golden brown, 1 minute or less.
Add the egg mixture. Stir with a spatula to scramble the eggs and cut them into smaller pieces. Cook until the eggs just begin to firm up. Transfer to a plate to cool.
Add the chives into a large bowl. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon of peanut oil. Mix with a spatula until the chives are evenly coated with a thin layer of oil.
Once the eggs are cooled, add them into the bowl with the chives. Add the oyster sauce and sesame oil. If you aren’t using the papery dried shrimp, add 1/2 teaspoon salt into the mixture.
Assemble
Once the dough has rested, the surface should become smoother and the texture softened. Divide the dough into two even pieces using a knife of dough cutter. Work on the dough one piece at a time. Place one piece back into the bowl and cover with plastic wrap.
Roll the dough on the working surface until it forms a ball. Cut the dough in half. Roll each piece into a long log, then divide it into 3 even pieces.
Add a small spoon of oil onto your working surface and use your hand to grease the surface. It prevents the dough from sticking to the surface.
Work on the dough one piece at a time. Roll the dough with both of your hands until it forms a ball.
Press the dough with your hand, then roll it out into a 6” (15 cm) disk.
Use a measuring cup to scoop 1/4 cup of egg-chive filling, press it down with your hand, and add more filling so it fills the cup tightly (very important). Add the filling onto the center of the rough disk. Fold the dough over it to create a half moon. Gently use your hand to press the filling to even it out.
Seal the edges of the dough together by gently pressing the dough and pressing out as much of the air bubbles as you can.
Crimp the edges by folding the excess dough together along the edge using your hand, one finger width at a time, until it forms a pattern. Cut off any extra dough at the end and discard it. If you don’t know how to crimp the edges, you can simply press the dough together so it won’t break apart during cooking.
Cook
Heat 1 to 2 tablespoons of oil in a large nonstick frying pan over medium heat until hot. Pan fry the Chinese chive pockets until the bottom turns golden brown, 2 minutes or so. Turn to the other side and fry until golden brown. If the pan starts to smoke, turn to medium-low heat. If your chive pockets are thick, you can also stand them upright in the pan to fry the edge.
Once done, transfer the chive pockets to a big plate. Serve hot with Chinkiang vinegar (highly recommended) or dumpling sauce. You can add soy sauce to the vinegar if you think the pockets are not salty enough.
Storage and reheating
To store the chive pockets, place in a ziplock bag, using parchment paper to separate the pockets. Squeeze out as much air as possible, and seal the bag. Freeze them for up to 2 months. To reheat frozen pockets, you don’t need to thaw them. Cook them in the pan just like if you were making fresh ones, except that you’ll need to cover the pan and add a splash of water while heating.

Sprinkle the toasted salt and Sichuan peppercorns over the chicken legs. Top with the Shaoxing wine, green onion, and ginger. Use your hand to gently massage the seasonings in and set aside for 15 minutes.
Prepare the stock
Use a cleaver or strong knife to chop the leg bones in half (Optional, to release more flavor). Add them to a small pot with the water, ginger, green onion, star anise, and jujubes.
Heat over medium-high heat until bringing to a boil, then reduce to medium-low heat. Simmer for 30 minutes, skimming the foam from the top occasionally. Transfer the stock to a heat proof container once done.
Add the goji berries, salt, sugar, and Shaoxing wine. Stir until the sugar and salt are fully dissolved. Place the stock in the fridge to cool down completely.
Steam the chicken
After the chicken has marinated, roll each leg into a tight log, skin side out.
Place the rolled chicken leg on a piece of aluminum foil. Wrap the leg with the foil to seal it completely.

Combine the minced ginger and hot water in a small bowl. Stir to mix well and set aside.
Prepare the dough
In a large tall plate or a big bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, cornstarch, instant yeast and sugar. Stir to mix well.
Slowly pour in the warm water, a few tablespoons at a time, and mix with a pair of chopsticks (or a fork). Once all the water has been added, keep mixing and scrape off the dry flour on the side of the bowl, until it forms many small dough flakes.
Pour in the vegetable oil. Keep mixing with the chopsticks until the oil is absorbed.
Start kneading by hand while further incorporating the dry flour, until there’s no dry flour left in the bowl.
Transfer the dough onto a working surface. Knead for 15 to 20 minutes, until the dough is quite smooth and elastic and there’s no dry flour left in the bowl. It’s OK if there’s some unevenness in the dough, which will smooth out after resting. The dough should be quite tough and not sticky to the touch. Cover and seal the bowl with plastic wrap. Let rest until it doubles in size, 1 hour or so.
Prepare the filling
Add the ginger water, light and dark soy sauce, Shaoxing wine, salt, sugar, and white pepper to the ground pork in a large bowl. Beat with a pair of chopsticks or a wooden spatula in a circular motion, until all the liquid is absorbed and the meat is sticky. This process might take a few minutes. (*Footnote 4)
Add the green onions and sesame oil. Mix until they are incorporated. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Store in the fridge until ready to use.
Assemble the buns
When the dough has rested, transfer to a work surface and punch it down. Knead for 1 minute to deflate the air out completely, then form it back into a ball.
Cut the dough in half. Wrap half of the dough in plastic wrap and store in the fridge while working on the other half.
Poke a hole in the center of the dough you’re working with. Stretch the dough into a large oval by running your fingers along the inside of the hole in a circular motion. Once the diameter of the dough is about 1” (2.5 cm), tear apart the ring so it creates a long, thin strip.
Cut the dough strip into 12 even pieces by cutting it in half, then further cut each half into 6 pieces. Gently use a circular motion to round up each dough piece then flatten it with your palm. Cover them with plastic wrap to prevent drying out.
Work on one piece of dough at a time - take one dough piece and place in front of you. Roll it with a rolling pin in one hand, using the other hand to rotate the dough while rolling, until the diameter reaches 5” (13 cm). You should keep the edges thinner than the center, so the wrapper of the bun will be even once you make the pleats.
Place the rolled dough in your palm and add 1 tablespoon of filling in the center.
Start wrapping the bun by folding and pinching the edge over itself, in one direction, until it is almost sealed. Then rotate and pinch the top of the pleats to fully seal the bun. (View my video for more details)
Repeat with the remaining dough pieces to wrap all the buns. Keep the wrapped buns under a piece of plastic wrap to prevent drying out. Once done wrapping, let rest for 10 minutes. Once rested, you should cook the buns immediately. You can store the wrapped buns in a sealed container in the fridge for up to 1 hour before cooking.
Repeat the wrapping steps to wrap the other half of the dough.
To cook the buns:
Add 2 tablespoons of oil and carefully place 12 wrapped buns into a 9” or 10” skillet. Heat over medium-high heat until hot. Turn to medium heat. Cook, uncovered, for 3 minutes, until the bottoms are lightly browned.
Pour about 1/4 cup hot water into the pan, just enough to cover the buns halfway up. Cover the pan and cook over medium heat for about 8 minutes, until the water is completely evaporated.
Turn the heat to medium-low and cook for another 2 to 3 minutes. Turn the heat off and remove the pan from the stove. Let the buns rest with the lid on for an additional 2 minutes. Remove the lid and transfer to a plate. Repeat the steps to cook the rest of the buns.

OPTION 1 - USING YOUR HANDS: Combine the flour and salt in a big bowl. Stir to mix well. Slowly drizzle in the hot water while mixing it with a pair of chopsticks (or a fork), until the water is fully absorbed. Slowly drizzle in the cool water, continuing to stir until many dough flakes form. Press the dough together, and try to combine the wet dough with the dry flour. Drizzle in a little extra water if there is any dry flour remaining. Knead until a firm ball is formed, about 5 minutes. Cover and let rest for 20 minutes.
OPTION 2 - USING A MIXER: Combine the flour and salt in the mixer bowl with the dough hook attachment. Turn it to the mix setting and slowly drizzle in the hot water followed by the cool water. After a minute of mixing, drizzling in a little extra water if there is any dry flour remaining. Turn to setting 4 and knead until a ball of dough is formed, about 3 minutes. Cover and let rest for 20 minutes.
Make the filling
While the dough is resting, combine the flour, oil, and salt in a small bowl. Mix until a smooth paste is formed.
If making the dipping sauce, combine all the ingredients with 1 tablespoon of water in a small bowl and mix until the sugar is dissolved.
Form the scallion pancakes
When the dough is done resting, knead for another minute until it is smooth. Cut the dough into 6 even pieces, about 76 grams per piece. Form the dough into balls using your hands.
Work on one dough ball at a time, covering the rest with plastic wrap to prevent drying out. Roll each dough ball into a thin rectangle with a rolling pin, aiming for around 6x10” (15x25 cm). Lift and turn the dough regularly as you roll it to prevent sticking. Spoon about 1 tablespoon of the filling onto the dough and spread it evenly with the back of a spoon, leaving about 1” (2.5 cm) on top and the left end without the filling. Sprinkle 2 heaping tablespoons of green onions onto the paste, concentrating most of it towards one side of the length and one side of the width, creating a loose L shape (see the blog post above for the step-by-step pictures).
Begin rolling the dough from the longer side of the dough where the green onions are concentrated, until you have one long tube. Lightly flatten the tube using your hand. Pinch the side with more green onion to seal it. Take the sealed side and gently pull and roll it towards the unsealed side, using your hand to smooth out the dough to push any large air bubbles out. Tuck the loose end under the rolled bun. Gently press down on the round disk with your hand to seal the pancake.
Set the formed pancake aside and cover it with plastic wrap. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until each pancake is ready.
Roll out the pancake
Roll each prepared pancake into a circle, about 7-8” (17-20 cm) wide. Flip and move it as you do to prevent sticking. Don’t worry if air bubbles burst through or some green onions fall out.
If you plan to store the pancakes and cook them later, place each pancake onto a piece of parchment paper and stack them. Transfer the pancakes to a large ziplock bag, squeeze out as much air as possible, and seal the bag. You can freeze the pancakes for up to 3 months.
Cook the pancakes
Heat a 9” (23 cm) cast iron pan (or a nonstick skillet) over medium-high heat and add enough oil to fully coat the bottom. Once the oil is hot, add a pancake. Use a pair of chopsticks (or a spatula) to swirl the pancake around to spread the oil and prevent sticking, for a few seconds. Cover the pan and turn the heat down to medium. Let the pancake cook, covered, for 1 minute. Remove the lid and flip the pancake, cover, and cook for another minute. Remove the lid. Use a spatula to press the pancake, to ensure even browning. Continue to cook, flipping regularly, until both sides are crisp and browned, about 3 minutes. Turn to medium-low heat if the pan gets too hot. Transfer the pancake to a cooling rack or a cutting board to cool. Repeat to cook all the pancakes you plan to serve.
Once the pancakes are slightly cooled enough to handle, cut into 6 pieces and transfer to a serving platter. Serve hot with the dipping sauce as an appetizer.
Cook frozen pancakes
Let the frozen pancakes thaw for 10 minutes then proceed from step 8.
Store and reheat cooked pancakes
Place the leftover pancakes in a ziplock bag by stacking them together. Store in the fridge up to 3 days. To reheat, add a pancake to a pan and heat over medium heat, cook, flip occasionally until the pancakes turn warm throughout.",en-US,"{'servingSize': '1 serving', 'calories': '202 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '25.7 g', 'proteinContent': '3.6 g', 'fatContent': '9.3 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '1.6 g', 'sodiumContent': '246 mg', 'fiberContent': '1.1 g', 'sugarContent': '0.3 g'}",4.84,,Omnivore's Cookbook,60,12 serving(s)

Prepare the shrimp by boiling a small pot of water with a large pinch of salt. Add the shrimp and cook for about 1 minute, until they turn pink and are fully curled. Once cool, slice the shrimp in half lengthwise and set aside.
If using the ground meat, heat the oil in a medium-sized pan until hot. Add the pork. Break it apart to keep the ground chunks small. Stir occasionally as you cook the pork until browned. Sprinkle with salt and add the wine. Keep cooking until all the liquid evaporates and the meat is cooked and chopped into small pieces. Transfer the meat to a plate to cool. (*Footnote 4)
Prepare the rest of the ingredients while the proteins are cooling off.
If you do not plan to serve the spring rolls the same day, you can now seal all the prepped ingredients in airtight containers and store them in the fridge for up to 2 days.
Make the sauce
To make the sesame sauce, combine everything in a medium-sized bowl and stir until it forms a smooth paste. If the paste is too thick, add a few drops of water at a time and mix until your desired consistency is reached.
To make the Nuoc Cham sauce, combine all the ingredients in a small bowl with 4 teaspoons of water. Depending on the strength of your fish sauce, you may want to add extra water or sugar according to your taste.
The sauce can be made ahead and stored in the fridge for up to 2 days.
Assemble
The day you plan to serve the spring rolls, place all the filling ingredients on plates for easy access. Fill a shallow but wide dish with an inch of warm water. (*Footnote 5) You should have a clean working surface like a cutting board that you can spread the rice paper on.
Work on the rolls one at a time. Take a rice paper wrapper and pull it through the water slowly 3 or 4 times (rotate the paper if your plate is not enough to fit the whole sheet of paper). You want it to be moist but still a bit stiff, as it will absorb more water as you place your filling on it and will be fully hydrated by the time you roll it up. Lay the moistened wrapper on a flat work surface.
To build the roll, work in thirds. Be sure to leave an inch and a half of space on the bottom and top of the wrapper. Also leave 2 inches of wrapper on the edges. (See the step-by-step photos in the blog post above for the folding steps.)
On the first third of the wrapper lay a piece of lettuce, then place 1 to 2 tablespoons of cooked ground meat in the center. Fold it so the meat is wrapped in the middle, then place it folded side down.
In the middle of the wrapper, lay a few slices of avocado, evenly spaced and at an angle. On top of the avocado, add a layer of carrots and a few herb leaves without the stems.
On the top third, place three of the halved shrimp, pink side down and evenly spaced.
Take the bottom edge of your wrapper and fold it over the third with the lettuce. Then roll the bottom third over the center. Take both sides and tightly fold them in. Tuck a sprig of the herbs at the edge of the roll, allowing them to poke out of one side. Then continue to roll over the shrimp and press lightly to seal on the remaining loose rice paper.
Set the formed spring rolls aside on a plate. Repeat the wrapping with all of the remaining rice wrappers. Make sure to space out the spring rolls, because the rice paper will stick together if the rolls are placed against each other.
Serve the spring rolls at room temperature with the dipping sauces. Enjoy!
Storage
You should always serve the spring rolls the same day you wrap them. If you plan to prepare them in advance, you should prep all the ingredients and wrap the spring rolls when you’re ready to serve. The ingredients will last in the fridge for 1 to 2 days. The wrapped spring rolls will last at room temperature for a couple of hours (half a day). You can place them in a container and make sure to leave some space between the rolls, so they won’t stick together. Avoid storing wrapped spring rolls in the fridge. The rice paper will become tough and the texture not very good.",en-US,"{'servingSize': '1 roll', 'calories': '190 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '14.5 g', 'proteinContent': '16.3 g', 'fatContent': '7.2 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '1.7 g', 'cholesterolContent': '90 mg', 'sodiumContent': '232 mg', 'fiberContent': '2.3 g', 'sugarContent': '1.3 g'}",5.0,,Omnivore's Cookbook,55,4 serving(s)

Combine all the marinade ingredients in a large bowl and mix well. Add the chicken wings and toss with your hands (or a pair of tongs), until the chicken is evenly coated. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Marinate for at least an hour at room temperature, or overnight in the fridge.
(Optional) Before cooking, take the top off of your marinating container and place it in the fridge, uncovered, for an hour. This will help dry out the outer layer of this skin to encourage crisping when baked.
Bake
Preheat the oven to 250°F (120°C).
Combine the dry rub ingredients in a large bowl and mix well.
Pat dry the marinated chicken with kitchen paper towels, and remove the large pieces of chili pepper from the Doubanjiang. Place the chicken wings in the dry rub bowl and toss to coat evenly.

After 15 minutes, flip the wings to allow the bottom to crisp up, 5 to 10 minutes.
Hot sauce
While baking the chicken, heat the oil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add the doubanjiang and ginger and saute until fragrant, around 30 seconds.
Add the vinegar and Shaoxing wine. Cook until some moisture is evaporated, about a minute.
Remove the sauce from the heat and pour it into a tall glass. Add the honey. Mix with an immersion blender until it forms a smooth sauce. Depending on the thickness of your Doubanjiang, you might need to add 1 to 2 tablespoons of water to the sauce to get the desired texture.

Thaw the dumpling wrappers overnight in the fridge or 30 minutes at room temperature.
Make the base
Combine the squash, butter, chicken broth, leftover gravy (or turkey dripping) if using, black pepper, nutmeg, and cardamon in a medium size bowl. Smash everything together and mix well with a spatula.
Cook spinach
Heat the oil in a medium-sized skillet over medium heat until hot. Add the garlic. Cook and stir to release the fragrance, 30 seconds or so.
Add the spinach. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the spinach is cooked through and all the liquid evaporates. Let cool for a few minutes.
Transfer the cooked spinach to a cutting board. Finely chop it into small bits.
Assemble
Add the cut spinach, turkey, and salt into the bowl with the mashed squash. Stir to mix well. Taste the mixture. It should taste slightly salty. Add more salt if needed. The texture should be similar to or slightly thicker than mashed potatoes - you should be able to shape it but it shouldn’t be too dry. Add a bit more broth if and mix it again if the mixture is too dry.
To set up your dumpling station, prepare a small bowl of water, the thawed wrappers, the bowl of dumpling filling, and a tray for the completed dumplings. Also, to prevent the wrappers and dumplings from drying out, wet a few layers of paper towel (or cheesecloth), and squeeze out the excess water. Loosely cover the wrappers and assembled dumplings.
Wrap the dumplings one by one. Wet the edge of a dumpling wrapper using your finger. Place 1 to 1 1/2 tablespoons of filling onto the center of the dumpling wrapper. Shape it into an oval shape. Pinch together the wrapper at one of the tapered ends of the filling. Fold the rest of the wrapper towards the pinched end, one side at a time, so it forms pleats (see the pictures in the blog post above or watch this video). Once the dumpling is sealed, use your fingers to press the pleats so it seals tightly. Set it aside and work on the rest of the dumplings.
Cook
Add 2 to 3 tablespoons of oil to a nonstick pan (or use a carbon steel or cast iron pan with more oil). Heat over medium heat until hot. Add the dumplings. You might need to cook the dumplings in batches depending on the size of your pan.
Pour in 1/4 cup water and cover the pan immediately. Let steam for 3 minutes, or until the dumpling wrapper turns semi transparent. Uncover the pan and check the bottom of the dumplings. If the bottom hasn’t browned, let cook for another minute or so, until the bottom turns golden brown. Transfer the dumplings to a plate.
Serve
Serve the dumplings as a snack, appetizer, or main dish with leftover cranberry sauce or cranberry relish.
Store
You can store the uncooked dumplings in an airtight container in the fridge for one day or in the freezer for up to a month. To cook the frozen dumplings, use the same method given in the recipe, but cook them covered for a longer time (6 minutes or so). For the cooked dumplings, you can store them in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. Reheat in the microwave or in a pan with oil for a crispier result.",en-US,"{'servingSize': '1 dumpling', 'calories': '71 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '9.6 g', 'proteinContent': '3.3 g', 'fatContent': '2.2 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '0.9 g', 'cholesterolContent': '7 mg', 'sodiumContent': '116 mg', 'fiberContent': '0.7 g', 'sugarContent': '0.2 g'}",-1.0,,Omnivore's Cookbook,10,24 serving(s)

Choose a shallow dish large enough to hold the pork belly (I used a baking dish). Add all the marinating ingredients and stir to mix well.
Pat the skin of the pork belly with a paper towel to dry completely. Score the skin into a crosshatch pattern using a sharp knife. Try to cut through the skin without piercing the fat.
Carefully transfer the pork into the shallow dish with the marinade. The marinade should come up to the sides of the pork but not touch the skin. Let it marinate in the fridge uncovered overnight or for up to a day.
Cook
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil for easy cleaning. Place a wire rack on top and then place the pork on the rack.
Evenly spread a layer of salt to cover the pork skin entirely.
Cook at 400 F (200 C) for 30 minutes. Then lower the oven temperature to 300 F (150 C). Bake for another 2 hours.
Raise the oven temperature to 450 F (230 C) and roast for another 30 to 45 minutes, until the skin completely crisps up.
Move the pork onto the kitchen counter and loosely cover with aluminum foil. Slash a cross on top of the foil to let out steam so the crackling will remain crispy. Rest for 10 to 15 minutes before serving. Alternatively, you can place the pork in the oven on the lowest setting if you won’t serve it immediately.
Serve the pork hot or warm with preferred dipping sauce (*Footnote 4).
Store and reheat
Store the leftover pork in fridge for 3 to 4 days.
To reheat, preheat the oven to 400 F (200C). Separate the skin from the meat. Place the skin in a baking dish without overlapping, in the middle or upper section of the oven. Wrap the meat with aluminum foil and place in the lower part of the oven. Bake for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the skin is bubbling and starts to turn dark.",en-US,"{'servingSize': '1 bowl', 'calories': '798 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '3.4 g', 'proteinContent': '14.5 g', 'fatContent': '80.2 g', 'cholesterolContent': '108.9 mg', 'sodiumContent': '203 mg', 'sugarContent': '2.2 g'}",5.0,,Omnivore's Cookbook,190,3 serving(s)

Prepare a large piece of foil (at least 2” / 5 cm bigger than the ribs on all sides) to layer over a baking sheet. Place the ribs back side up onto the foil.
Combine the dry rub ingredients in a small bowl and mix well. Sprinkle evenly over the back of the ribs and rub in. Flip the ribs and sprinkle on the top side, rub in the spice again. Set aside to marinate briefly while preheating the oven to 275°F (135°C).
Combine the sauce ingredients in a medium-sized bowl. Mix well.
Once the oven is heated, brush a thin layer of sauce all over the ribs.
Place another piece of foil over the top. Crimp the bottom foil over the top foil and fold a few times to create a sealed parcel.
Place the ribs in the oven and bake for 2 to 3 hours depending on their size (*Footnote 2). Once done, you can use a thermometer or a fork to poke through the foil to test the doneness. The meat should feel very tender or read at least 160°F/71°C.
While cooking, prepare a baking tray lined with foil (or parchment paper) and a rack on top.
Remove the ribs from the oven and turn the heat up to 450°F (230°C).
Carefully open the parcel and move the ribs to the prepared baking tray. You might need to use 2 spatulas to help with this step because the ribs are extremely tender and might fall apart.
Generously brush the top and back of the ribs with the sauce, leaving a few tablespoons for after cooking.
Return the ribs to the oven and bake until beginning to char, 10 to 15 minutes. Check on the ribs every 5 minutes to prevent them from burning.

Pork Zongzi (Cantonese Savory Sticky Rice Dumplings),Maggie Zhu,https://omnivorescookbook.com/pork-zongzi/,Chinese,https://omnivorescookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/200605_Pork-Zong-Zi_4.jpg,"['24 to 36 dried bamboo leaves ((Footnote 1))', '24 2 ft (60 cm) twine', '3 cups (600 g) short grain sweet rice (, washed (Footnote 2))', '1 teaspoon sugar', '1 tablespoon soy sauce', '1 tablespoon dark soy sauce', '1 tablespoon oyster sauce', '12 oz (350 g) fatty pork (pork belly, chop, or loin with fat attached) (, cut into 2” (5cm) chunks (Footnote 3))', '1 tablespoon Shaoxing wine ((or dry sherry))', '2 teaspoons soy sauce', '1 teaspoon dark soy sauce', '2 teaspoons sugar', '1 teaspoon salt', '1/2 teaspoon five spice powder', '2 teaspoons grated ginger', '2 green onions (, sliced diagonally)', '3/4 cup (150 g) shelled mung beans (, washed)', '12 dried shiitake mushrooms', '6 salted duck egg yolks (, halved)']","Prepare ahead
Soak the bamboo leaves, sweet rice, and mung beans separately in water overnight.
Combine all the pork ingredients and allow to marinate overnight.
The day of making the zongzi
(Optional- to sanitize the bamboo leaves, remove them from the soaking liquid and add them to a pot with fresh water. Bring it to a boil and cook the leaves for 5 minutes.) Drain the leaves and wipe them each down on both sides. Cut off an inch from the base and an inch from the tip.
Place the shiitake mushrooms in a medium-sized bowl and add hot water to cover. Soak for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the mushrooms are soft throughout. Drain the mushrooms, squeeze out the excess water, and slice them into quarters.
Drain the rice and transfer it to a big bowl. Add the seasonings to the rice and mix until evenly coated.
Drain the mung beans and transfer them to a medium-sized bowl.
To wrap the zongzi (see the process photos above for the steps)
Take two leaves, making sure they do not have any holes or tears. Use a pair of kitchen scissors to cut off 1” (2.5 cm) from both ends. Face the smooth sides towards yourself (this is the side that will contain the filling), with the wider base sides facing away from each other, then overlap the leaves to make 1 long strip. There should be 3-4” (8-10 cm) of individual leaf sticking out beyond the overlap on each side. A third of the way along the strip, pinch the side opposite from you and fold it into a cone shape, with the leaf sticking out from one end. Hold the cone using one hand and begin to add the filling with your other hand.
Add 2-3 tablespoons of rice to the bottom and press it up against the sides to create a small well. Add a piece of pork (make sure every piece added has a chunk of fat), half a yolk, two quarters a shiitake, and 1 to 2 tablespoons of mung beans. Add 2 to 3 tablespoons of rice over everything. Gently press and smooth as you do. There should be a 1/4” (1/2 cm) lip around the rice.
Take the open side of the zongzi between your thumb and index finger and fold the sides inwards, covering the rice. Fold the long leaves over the open area, tightening between your thumb and index finger to create a pointed triangular shape. Then flip the zongzi over and wrap the leaves around tightly to seal it. Wrap the zongzi in a piece of twine, making sure it is cinching any area where the leaf might come loose, and tie it off. For extra security, you can use another piece of twine to wrap the zongzi again, crosswise.
Cook the zongzi
Cook on the stovetop: Bring a large pot of water to boil and add the zongzi. Return the pot to a low simmer and cook covered for 3 hours (4 if the zongzi are very large).
Cook in an Instant Pot: Add the zongzi to an Instant Pot and water to cover. Close the lid and make sure the valve is sealed. Choose “Manual” at “High Pressure” and set a timer for 1 hour. Once done, let the Instant Pot release the pressure naturally.
Drain the zongzi from the water and serve hot.
Store and reheat
Store cooked and wrapped zongzi in an airtight container or Ziplock bag in the fridge for 5 days or in the freezer for up to 6 months. To reheat, thaw the zongzi completely in the fridge overnight. Boil the zongzi in water until heated through, 15 to 20 minutes. You can heat up the unwrapped zongzi in a microwave as well.",en-US,"{'servingSize': '1 zongzi', 'calories': '314 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '49.6 g', 'proteinContent': '14.1 g', 'fatContent': '5.7 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '2.1 g', 'cholesterolContent': '124 mg', 'sodiumContent': '470 mg', 'fiberContent': '3.3 g', 'sugarContent': '2.8 g'}",5.0,,Omnivore's Cookbook,960,12 serving(s)

Rinse the shiitake mushrooms and dried shrimp separately with tap water and gently rub them to remove any dirt. Place each ingredient into a different bowl. Add hot water to cover. Soak for 15 minutes, or until the ingredients turn soft. Drain and dice into small pieces.
Peel the daikon radish and grate it into thin strips.
Cook
Add the Chinese sausage into a large nonstick skillet and heat it over medium heat. Cook until the sausage is lightly browned and some oil is rendered off, 5 minutes or so.
Add the shiitake mushrooms and dried shrimp. Cook and stir for 1 minute. Add the green onions. Stir a few times to release the fragrance. Transfer everything to a plate.
Add the daikon radish and 1 cup of water. Cover and cook over medium heat until translucent and soft but not browned, 12 minutes or so. Once done, taste the daikon to make sure it's fully cooked through and turned very soft. Transfer the cooked radish into a big bowl using a pair of tongs. Squeeze out as much juice as you can, back into the pan. Once done, transfer all the juice from the pan to a measuring cup. Then add more water until it reaches 1 cup (no need to add extra water if you end up with a full cup). Rest the liquid until it's slightly cooled, 10 to 15 minutes.
Add rice flour and the cooled daikon cooking liquid into the bowl with the cooked radish. Add the sugar, salt, and white pepper. Stir to mix well. It will form a very runny batter.
Pour the batter back into the pan you used to cook the radish. Cook over medium-low heat and stir constantly, until the mixture has thickened just enough to draw a line on the bottom of the pan, 1 to 2 minutes.
Assemble & steam
Prepare 1 to 2 glass tupperware or baking dishes that can fit into your steamer. I used two 4.5” x 4.5” (11cm x 11 cm) glass containers to cook two batches. If you have a large wok or steamer, you might be able to fit an 8” x 8” (20cm x 20cm) baking pan in it. You’ll only need to cook one batch in this case. If you’ll be cooking in two batches, cover the uncooked batter with plastic wrap to prevent it from drying out.
Grease the glass tupperware with oil, so the turnip cake will come off easily later. Transfer the mixture into the tupperware, about 1.5” (4 cm) thick
Set up your steamer by adding water to the pan and bringing it to a boil. Add the steaming rack with the turnip cake container. Cook, covered, over medium-high heat, for 1 hour, until the turnip cake is cooked through. You can test the doneness by inserting a knife into the cake and it should come out clean. If your batter is slightly thicker or thinner, you might need to adjust the cooking time by adding or subtracting 10 minutes.
Once done, remove the container from the steamer and set it aside to cool. Once the container is no longer hot, transfer it to the fridge. Let the turnip cake set until it has cooled completely. I highly recommend resting it overnight before serving. I’ve tried resting it 2 hours, and the turnip cake was a bit too soft and difficult to slice.
To remove the fully chilled turnip cake, use a knife to loosen the edges from the container, then turn the container upside down. The turnip cake should come out in one piece.
Reheat & Serve
To serve, cut the turnip cakes into 1/4” (1 cm) thick pieces. Brown both sides in a heated skillet coated with a thin layer of oil until heated through and the surface turns golden.
To store, transfer the steamed turnip cakes (without pan-frying) into an airtight container and store them in the fridge for 2 to 3 days, or in the freezer for up to 1 month. To reheat, thaw the frozen turnip cakes first, and pan fry them before serving.",en-US,"{'servingSize': '1 serving', 'calories': '170 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '25.5 g', 'proteinContent': '7 g', 'fatContent': '5 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '1.6 g', 'cholesterolContent': '19 mg', 'sodiumContent': '559 mg', 'fiberContent': '2.9 g', 'sugarContent': '3.4 g'}",4.5,,Omnivore's Cookbook,1550,8 serving(s)

Fold the green beans into the paste using a spatula.
Heat 1/2-inch oil in a small deep pot over medium heat until hot (*Footnote 4).
Work on the fish cakes in batches. Use a cookie scoop to transfer a ball of 2 tablespoons of fish paste onto an oiled spatula. Then use the back of another spatula or a large spoon to flatten the ball into a 1/4-inch (1/2-cm) thick disc. Gently slide the fish cake into the pan. Fry until the bottom side turns golden, about 30 to 40 seconds. Flip and cook the other side until golden. The whole process should take about 1 minute.

Add flour into a large bowl. Slowly pour the water into the bowl, mixing them together with a pair of chopsticks.
When the water is mixed with the flour, dust both hands with flour and start kneading to form dough. The dough will be quite tough and should easily be able to be lifted from the bowl without sticking to the bottom.
When dough has formed, dust the working surface with flour and dust hands again. Transfer the dough to the working surface and continue to knead it until its surface becomes smooth, about 10 minutes.
Rinse a clean dish towel with water. Dust the bottom of a large bowl with flour and transfer the dough into it. Cover bowl with the damp dish towel and a lid (or plastic wrap). Let the dough rest for 2 hours. You can let the dough rest longer, 4 to 5 hours.
After resting, the dough will be softened and have a smooth texture. Dust the working surface and your hands with extra flour and transfer the dough onto the surface. Knead the dough repeatedly for another 3 to 5 minutes, until the dough hardens again. Let the dough rest for about 30 minutes (or longer).
During this time, you can prepare the dumpling filling(s).
To make dumplings
Dust the working surface again and transfer the dough onto it. Slice 1/6 of the dough off and place the rest back to the big bowl. Cover it with the damp dish towel.
Roll the dough into a long stick, 2.5 to 3 centimeters (1 inch) in diameter. Use a knife to cut the dough stick into about 12 small doughs, each weighing 12 to 14 grams (0.4 to 0.5 oz) (*see footnote 2).
Slightly dust both sides of each small dough with flour. Work on them one at a time.
Dust the working surface again. Take one dough and press it to a round disc. Roll it with a rolling pin into a round sheet (refer to the video to see how). Try to roll it so that that the edge is thinner than the center. The wrapper should be about 1 millimeter thick (i.e. almost same as the thickness of a CD), and the diameter should be about 7 centimeters. It is ok if the wrapper is not perfectly round.
Starting here, you should work as quickly as you can, because the wrappers will dry out quickly. And if they do, you will find it very difficult to seal the dumplings later. If the wrappers dry out when you start to fold the dumplings, brush a bit of water over the edge so you can still seal the dough.
Scoop about 1 tablespoon (or less, so you can easily fold the dumpling) of dumpling filling and place it in the center of the wrapper. Hold the dumpling with one hand and start sealing the edges with the other hand (refer to the video to see how to fold a dumpling). Be careful, when you press the edges together to seal the dumpling, do not let filling touch the sealing area (the dumpling will fall apart if you do). After folding, press edge again to seal well. You don’t need to fold beautiful dumplings here; our goal is to make the dumplings hold their shape during boiling.
Place the dumplings on the working surface and work on the rest of the doughs in the same manner.
Try to wrap and cook dumplings in small batches (20 to 25 dumplings at a time). If you won't cook dumplings soon after wrapping (within 30 minutes), freeze them first (refer to the session ""to store dumpling"" below). If you want to know the reason, read the session of ""Things you should take note of"" above.
To cook boiled dumplings
Bring a large pot of water to a boil.
Carefully add dumplings one at a time into the water. Use a big ladle to stir the water gently and continuously, until the water starts to boil again, so the dumplings won’t stick to the bottom, for about 1 minute. Adjust the heat so the water is at boiling point, but isn’t bubbling too fiercely.
When the dumplings float to the surface, continue boiling until the dumplings are filled with air and swollen, and the dough starts to become transparent, about 1 minute (*see footnote 3). Immediately transfer all the dumplings to a plate.
(*) Be careful, the dumplings cook quickly and you should always stand beside the pot throughout the boiling process. When the dumplings are cooked, they will start to fall apart within seconds, so transfer them as soon as possible.
To cook potstickers
Heat a tablespoon of oil in a nonstick skillet over medium high heat. When oil is hot, place potstickers in the skillet, pleat side up.
Swirl 2 tablespoons water in the skillet, cover immediately, and turn the heat to medium. Cook covered until the water is evaporated and potstickers are cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes.
Remove the cover and flip one potsticker to see whether the bottom side is charred. If not, turn to medium high heat and cook until the bottom side turns golden brown.
Transfer the potstickers to a plate.
To serve dumplings
Option 1: Serve with Chinese black vinegar and a few ginger slices.
Option 2: Serve with 1 tablespoon Chinese black vinegar + 1 teaspoon light soy sauce + 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil.
Option 3: Serve with Chinese black vinegar and a few drops fresh Chili oil.
To freeze raw dumplings
If you plan to store dumplings or won't serve them immediately, always freeze them uncooked. It won’t affect the texture or flavor of the dumplings.
Dust the bottom of a big airtight box with a thin layer of flour. Place the dumplings, one finger’s width apart. Store in the freezer for up to 2 months.
To cook frozen dumplings
Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add dumplings into the water. Use a big ladle to stir a few times. Cover and cook until the water starts to boil again. Adjust the heat so the water will keep boiling without spilling. Cover and cook for 3 minutes (up to 5 minutes for bigger dumplings). Uncover pot. Continue to cook for about 1 minute (up to 2 minutes for bigger dumplings), until cooked through. Transfer to a plate immediately.
To store and reheat cooked dumplings
Store leftover boiled dumplings in airtight container in the fridge and consume as soon as possible, within 1 to 2 days.
To reheat in microwave - Add dumplings into a bowl and sprinkle with a few drops of water. Cover and heat until warm.
To reheat by steaming - Place dumplings in a bowl. Place a tall-rimmed plate upside down in a pot and add water to cover. Place the bowl of dumplings on top. Heat over high heat until water is boiling. Continue cooking for 5 minutes.
To pan fry - Grease a nonstick skillet with a thin layer of oil and heat over medium heat. When skillet is hot, add dumplings. Swirl in a tablespoon of water, cover immediately, and cook for 2 to 3 minutes.",en-US,"{'servingSize': '1 dumpling', 'calories': '23 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '4.8 g', 'proteinContent': '0.7 g', 'fatContent': '0.1 g'}",4.91,,Omnivore's Cookbook,260,70 serving(s)

Wrap the egg rolls
To prepare the wrapping station: Add some water to a small bowl. Place the egg roll wrappers on a plate along with a spoon and the filling. Prepare a large plate or oven tray to hold the wrapped egg rolls and a cutting board for wrapping the egg rolls.
To wrap an egg roll, gently remove one egg roll sheet from the stack using both of your hands and place it on the cutting board, with a corner pointed toward you. Add 2 to 3 tablespoons of filling onto the lower end of the wrapper, making a 4-inch (10 cm) wide, tight and even mound. Tightly roll from the bottom corner toward the top, until about halfway up. Tightly fold the left and right corners of the wrapper towards the center, so it looks like an opened envelope. Dip your finger into the water and brush the top corner of the wrapper. Tightly roll the egg rolls upward until it’s completely sealed. Repeat the process, until you’ve used all the filling.
Although you can freeze the egg rolls at this stage, I personally prefer to cook them all and store the cooked ones so I only need to set up the deep frying equipment once. On the other hand, if you want to make the egg rolls in advance and serve them fresh at your party, you can freeze the egg rolls without cooking them. To do so, place the egg rolls on a baking sheet with gaps in between. Wrap them tightly with plastic wrap and store in the freezer until ready to cook. You can fry them directly from the freezer, with an additional 1 minute of fry time.
Cook the egg rolls
Prepare a baking sheet with a rack on top, for cooling the egg rolls.
Option 1 - To deep fry the egg rolls, heat 1-inch (2.5 cm) of oil in a deep medium pot or a dutch oven over medium heat to 350 F (177 C). If you do not have a thermometer, insert a wooden chopstick into the heated oil. You should see continuous tiny bubbles coming up around the chopstick. If the bubbles only come up here and there, the oil is not hot enough. If the bubbles are large and bursting to the surface, the oil is too hot.
Fry the egg rolls in batches of 5 to 6. Flip and move them occasionally for even browning. Fry until the egg rolls are golden, 5 to 6 minutes. Drain and transfer the egg rolls with a slotted spoon or wire spider onto the rack to let them cool. Repeat until you have cooked all the egg rolls.
Option 2 - To bake the egg rolls in the oven, preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 C). Place the egg rolls onto a lined baking sheet, seam-side-down, with about 2 fingers’ width gap between. Generously spray oil on top. Bake for 9 minutes, or until the bottom turns a golden color. Flip the spring rolls and spray oil onto them again. Return the tray to the oven. Bake for another 6 to 8 minutes, until the other side is golden as well. Once done, let the egg rolls cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes before serving to maximize crispiness.
Option 3 - To fry the egg rolls in an air-fryer, preheat the air-fryer to 390 F (10 mins or so). Cook them in batches. Spread a few spring rolls in the basket without overlapping them. Spray with a thin layer of oil, or you can bake them without using any oil. Bake for 6 minutes, flip, and bake for another 5 minutes. Once done, let the egg rolls cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes before serving to maximize crispiness.
Serve the egg rolls hot with whichever dipping sauce(s) you prefer.
Store and reheat
You can store the cooked egg rolls and reheat them later. If stored and reheated properly, the egg rolls will be just as crispy as freshly fried.
To store the egg rolls, spread them on a wire rack and let them cool completely. The egg rolls will be very hot inside once cooked, so it might take 1 to 2 hours for them to cool completely. Once cooled, you can store them in an airtight container or in a large ziplock bag. To get the best result, I prefer to spread the egg rolls in a single layer in a gallon ziplock bag and lay them flat in the fridge (or freezer). This way, the egg rolls won’t overlap and get soggy.
You can reheat the egg rolls in the oven or in an air fryer. Bake them at 350 F (180 C) until hot, or for about 10 minutes or so. The rolls will remain crispy.",en-US,"{'servingSize': '20 g', 'calories': '101 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '9.4 g', 'proteinContent': '8.3 g', 'fatContent': '4.1 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '0.7 g', 'cholesterolContent': '23 mg', 'sodiumContent': '244 mg', 'fiberContent': '0.6 g', 'sugarContent': '1.2 g'}",5.0,,Omnivore's Cookbook,60,20 serving(s)

Make the wontons
Add the minced pork into a medium-sized bowl. Add the aromatic water, egg, cornstarch, and white pepper powder. Mix until it forms a smooth and sticky paste.
Work on the wontons one at a time. Place about half a teaspoon of filling (or 1 teaspoon filling for bigger wontons) on the lower third of the wrapper. Fold the bottom side over the filling, then roll the filling all the way across to the other side of the wrapper. Brush a thin layer of egg white on one end of the wonton wrapper. Bind both ends and press them together to lock the filling inside the wrapper. Place on a big plate, a finger’s width apart.
When you’ve finished 10 to 15 wontons, cover them with a wet paper towel to prevent them from drying out.

Chinese Pickled Cabbage (A Quick Pickle Recipe),Maggie Zhu,https://omnivorescookbook.com/chinese-pickled-cabbage/,Chinese,https://omnivorescookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/1910_Chinese-Pickled-Cabbage_550.jpg,"['1 1/2 cups rice vinegar', '1/2 cup water', '3/4 cup sugar', '1 teaspoon salt', '3 cloves garlic (, smashed)', '4 red chili peppers (more if desired (Optional))', '1 teaspoon Sichuan peppercorns ((Optional))', '1 lbs (450 g) cabbage ((about half of a small head of cabbage))', '1 large carrot (, peeled)', '2 tablespoons salt']","Combine the rice vinegar, water, sugar, salt, and chili peppers in a small saucepan. Heat over medium heat until it reaches a simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes, until the sugar is dissolved. Use a clean spoon to taste the pickling liquid to see if it has the desired spice level. You can simmer it for a bit longer if you want the liquid to taste spicier. Once done, set aside and allow to cool.
Meanwhile, prepare the veggies. Cut out the cabbage core and discard it. Tear the leaves into bite-size pieces. Cut the carrot into 1/4” (1/2 cm) thick half-moon shaped slices.
Combine the cabbage, carrots, and 2 tablespoons of salt in a big bowl. Toss it with your hands so the veggies are coated with salt. Let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes, up to 1 hour (no more than an hour).
Drain and discard the salted water released by the veggies. Rinse the veggies with tap water twice. Drain thoroughly, and squeeze out the excess water from the veggies. Transfer them into a large container (or a jar).
Add the crushed garlic and Sichuan peppercorns (if using) into the same container.
Add the cooled pickling liquid. Press the veggies so they are submerged in the liquid. It is fine if a small fraction of the veggies are poking out from the liquid (because the veggies will shrink over time and become submerged). Seal the container and allow to pickle for 3 days in the fridge.
The pickles will start to taste good after 1 day, but the sourness will come through at day 3. Make sure to use clean chopsticks (or flatware) to pick out the pickles every time you serve them. They will stay good in the fridge for 2 to 3 weeks.",en-US,"{'servingSize': '1 serving', 'calories': '32 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '7.6 g', 'proteinContent': '0.9 g', 'fatContent': '0.1 g', 'sodiumContent': '91 mg', 'fiberContent': '1.7 g', 'sugarContent': '5.3 g'}",-1.0,,Omnivore's Cookbook,20,8 serving(s)
Barter-Worthy Spam Musubi,Maggie Zhu,https://omnivorescookbook.com/spam-musubi/,hawaii,https://omnivorescookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/1901_Spam-Sushi_800.jpg,"['1 teaspoon vegetable oil', '1 can (12 oz. / 340 g) Spam (, sliced into 8 pieces)', '1/4 cup water', '2 teaspoons soy sauce', '2 tablespoons sugar', '4 cups cooked sushi rice ((or regular cooked white rice (*Footnote)))', '3 sheets roasted seaweed (nori, cut into 8 strips about 2” (5 cm) wide and 9” (23 cm) long)']","Start making steamed rice (or sushi rice) if you don’t have any on hand.
Heat a 12-inch (30cm) nonstick or well-seasoned cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Add the Spam slices and cook until browned and crisp on the bottom side, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook until the other side is also browned and crisp, 2 to 3 minutes.
Whisk together the water and soy sauce in a small bowl. Sprinkle the sugar evenly over the Spam slices, then add the soy sauce mixture. Swirl to evenly distribute, then let the Spam simmer until the liquid is nearly absorbed, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip once in between, so the sugar will melt completely and camalize well. Transfer the Spam slices to a plate to cool.
To make the sushi: Place one slice of Spam perpendicular to the nori strip on the bottom of the strip (forming a cross shape). Wet the palms and fingers of both hands, measure 1/2 cup of rice, and transfer the rice to your palm. Use both hands to firmly press the rice into a ball. Then hold the rice ball with your left hand, with your thumb and the other four fingers to secure both sides, use your right hand to gently press the rice ball into a rectangular shape about the size of the Spam slice. Place the rice on top of the Spam. Roll up the Spam and rice to let the nori sheet wrap around it. Seal the end with a bit of water and place the musubi seam-side-down while you work on the rest. Repeat with the remaining nori strips, Spam slices, and rice. Remember to rinse your hands every time, to minimize rice sticking to your hands.
Enjoy the spam musubi immediately at room temperature. You can store them in an airtight container or wrap them with plastic wrap and place them in the fridge.

Combine the filling ingredients in a big bowl. Use a spatula to mix it in a circular motion, until everything comes together and the pork feels elastic. It might take a few minutes to get this consistency.
Assemble
Place the lumpia wrappers on a plate and cover with a damp towel to prevent from drying out.
Take a wrapper and lay it in front of you with the pointed edge facing up. (*Footnote 2) Take a heaping tablespoon of filling and place it a few inches from the corner closest to you. Shape the filling into a 4 to 5"" (10 to 12 cm) strip. Fold the bottom corner over the filling, then fold the two side corners. Roll the filling parcel up so the folded edges are tucked in. Gently use your finger to press out any air bubbles and make sure the filling is sealed in tightly. Continue rolling up the filling until just before it is completely sealed. Dab the upper corner with a small amount of egg wash with your finger, then fold the filling over to finish wrapping the lumpia. Set aside. Repeat with the remaining filling and wrappers.
Storage
Once you wrap the lumpia, you can store them uncooked in a large Ziplock bag with as much air squeezed out as possible, for up to 3 months in the freezer.
To cook the frozen lumpia, cook them according to the instructions below without thawing. The cooking time will take slightly longer.
Cook (*Footnote 3)
Add the oil to a medium deep pan or pot so that it comes about 1"" (2.5cm) up. Heat over medium-high heat until it reaches 350°F (176°C).
Gently lower a few lumpia into the pan so they do not crowd the pan. Cook, flipping with a pair of tongs occasionally, until all sides turn golden brown, about 4 minutes total. Once the lumpia are cooked, transfer to a big plate or a tray topped with a wire rack to cool.
Combine all the sauce ingredients in a small pot. Bring to a gentle boil over medium heat. Stir constantly, until the sauce is thickened enough to coat the back of a spoon. Pour into a serving dish.
Serve the lumpia with the dipping sauce as an appetizer.
You can store the cooked lumpia as well and warm them up in a 400°F (200°C) oven until warmed through. The leftovers will be slightly chewy but still crispy.",en-US,"{'servingSize': '1 serving', 'calories': '95 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '14.2 g', 'proteinContent': '4.8 g', 'fatContent': '1.7 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '0.3 g', 'cholesterolContent': '13 mg', 'sodiumContent': '270 mg', 'fiberContent': '0.1 g', 'sugarContent': '1.2 g'}",5.0,,Omnivore's Cookbook,55,12 serving(s)

If you plan to marinate longer, store in the fridge for a couple hours, up to overnight.
Combine all the sauce ingredients in a blender and mix until it forms a smooth sauce. If the sauce comes out too thick (depending on the density of the peanut butter you use), add 1 or 2 tablespoons more water and blend again. Transfer to a bowl and set aside.

Combine ribs with the marinade sauce in a big bowl and mix well. Marinate at room temperature for a minimum of 30 minutes or in the fridge, up to overnight.
To set up the steamer, use a large plate that has some depth (to hold the broth) that can fit in your steamer. You will also need to use a wok or a skillet to hold the steamer. In the case of a skillet, you might need a rack to elevate the steamer, so the water underneath doesn’t touch the bottom of the steamer.
Spread the ribs on the plate with minimum overlapping and place the plate into the steamer. (*Footnote 2)
Add water to the wok (or skillet) to about 1-inches deep but not so deep it reaches the bottom of the steamer. Heat over a high heat until boiling.
Place the steaming rack, covered, on top of the wok. You should see steam rising from the top of the steamer. Cook over a medium-high heat until the ribs are just cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes for small bite-size ribs, and 20 minutes for meatier pieces. Test the ribs by cutting through. The meat should have a little hint of pink near the bones. Cook, covered, in 5 minute increments if the ribs are not done.
Garnish with chopped green onion, if using.
