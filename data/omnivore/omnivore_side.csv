Transfer to a big plate.
Combine light soy sauce, Japanese sake, and sugar in a small bowl. Mix well.
Use a dining spoon to distribute the sauce over the mushrooms. Mix with chopsticks until the mushrooms are evenly covered with the sauce. Marinate for 15 minutes.
Add 1 tablespoon peanut oil to a nonstick skillet and heat over medium high heat until warm. Add 2 teaspoons green onion and stir a few times.
Cook mushrooms in batches. Spread them across the skillet without overlapping them. Save the marinating liquid for later use.
Let mushrooms grill without stirring them. When the skillet gets hot, turn to medium heat (or low heat if the skillet starts to smoke). When the bottom side turns golden, flip with chopsticks (or tongs) to grill the other side. Keep grilling and flipping, until both sides turn golden brown, with slightly charred edges. The process took me 8 minutes, but your cooking time will vary depending on the type of stove you’re using. Transfer the mushrooms to a plate and set aside.
Add the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil and 2 teaspoons of green onion. Continue to cook the remainder of the mushrooms. The cooking process will be shorter this time, since the skillet is quite hot already. Adjust heat between low and medium to cook the mushrooms slowly, with the skillet remaining hot. The mushrooms should be slightly charred and dehydrated without getting burnt. (I cooked two batches with a 9"" / 24 cm skillet. You might need to cook more (or fewer) batches depending on the amount of mushrooms and the size of your skillet. Be sure to adjust the amount of oil accordingly.
When the last batch of mushrooms is cooked, add the previous batch(es) back into the skillet.
Pour the marinade over the mushrooms. Keep cooking over medium low heat until the liquid is absorbed, 2 to 3 minutes.
Place the mushrooms onto the steamed rice. Garnish with the remaining 2 teaspoons of green onion and the sesame seeds.

Peel the potatoes and give them a quick rinse under running water. Shred them with a mandoline or a julienne peeler along the length of the potato.

Usually 30 minutes is a good amount of time to soak them, but I have been known to soak them overnight in the refrigerator.
Cut the bell pepper in half lengthwise and discard the stem, seeds, and ribs. Thinly cut the pepper halves lengthwise into matchstick-like shreds. Ideally they should be the same thickness as the potato shreds.
Lay out a clean cotton kitchen towel or several layers of paper towels on the counter, for drying the potatoes. Drain the potatoes in a colander and give them a quick rinse under cold running water. Give the colander a few shakes to rid the shreds of excess water. Spread the shreds out on the towel and pat them completely dry.

Once the oil appears to shimmer, drop in 2 of the chiles and stir them around until they blacken and smell smoky, 5 to 10 seconds. Add half of the potatoes and half of the bell pepper to the smoky oil. Stir-fry them vigorously, without stopping, to briefly cook the shreds but still make sure they maintain their toothsome quality (*Footnote 7), 2 to 3 minutes. Scrape everything into a serving bowl. Wipe out the pan with paper towels before you repeat with the remaining oil, chiles, potatoes, and bell pepper. (*Footnote 8)

Combine all the marinade ingredients in a small pot. Bring it to a boil, then simmer for 5 minutes. Remove the pot from the stove and let it cool.
Boil the eggs
Prepare a pot that is large enough to hold all the eggs without overlapping them. Add just enough water to cover the eggs. Heat over medium-high heat until boiling. Lower the heat to medium.
Transfer the eggs to a ladle or a colander. Slowly lower the eggs into the water to prevent them from cracking. Adjust the heat so the water maintains a slow boil.
Bring a small pot with just enough water to cover your 6 eggs to a boil.
(Optional) If you wish to keep the egg yolks in the center of the eggs, stir the water in a consistent circle for the first minute of cooking.
Cook for 6 minutes for runny yolks, 8 minutes for semi-firm, or 11 minutes for hard boiled.
While the eggs are boiling, prepare an ice bath (or a big bowl of cold water if you don’t have ice).
When the eggs are done cooking, run cold water over them for 30 seconds. Add the eggs to the ice bath and let them cool completely, about 10 minutes.
Marinate the eggs
Once the marinade is cooled until no longer hot to touch, transfer it into a tall container that is large enough to hold 8 cups of water (*Footnote 4).
Carefully crack the egg shells by tapping them with the back of a spoon or by gently rolling them on the counter. Starting from the bottom, begin peeling each egg, dipping it back into the water as needed to help loosen the shell. Make sure to peel off the egg membrane completely, so the egg will marinate evenly. Once peeled, place the eggs into the marinade container.
Marinate the eggs in the fridge for a minimum of 6 hours before serving. If you want to serve the eggs sooner, simply drizzle some extra marinade onto the cut eggs. Store the eggs in the marinade in the fridge for up to a week.
How to serve
You can serve the eggs over steamed rice or boiled noodles, drizzled with extra marinade and some homemade chili oil (if you wish). You can also make noodle soup by combining some marinade with hot noodle boiling water.

Wash gently with hands, using a swirling motion. Discard the water. Repeat another two times. This will remove the outer starch of the rice. Without this step, the cooked rice might turn out gummy.
Transfer the rice into a colander on top of a big bowl. Shake a few times, and let the extra water drain out for 5 minutes.
Transfer rice to pressure cooker and add water. Cover and make sure the pressure cooker valve is sealed.
Cook at high pressure for 28 minutes. If using an Instant Pot, push “Manual” and set timer to 28 minutes. If using a stovetop pressure cooker, cook over medium high heat until pressure is reached.
When the rice is done, release pressure using fast release.
At this point, the rice on the bottom will be moist and fragile. Use a rice paddle (or a fork) to gently fluff the rice by lifting from the bottom. Cover again and let rest for 10 to 20 minutes. This will redistribute the moisture and cook the rice more evenly.
Once the rice has rested, you’ll noticed the texture is not so wet anymore. Now you can serve the rice.
Quick tip: rinse your pressure cooker while it’s still warm, and the residual starch will come off easily. Once the pot has completely cooled off, you might need extra soaking time to clean the pot.
Store
If you don’t serve the rice right away, transfer and spread it on a large plate or tray to cool. (*see footnote 2)
Once the rice has cooled down (it usually takes 15 to 20 minutes), immediately transfer it into small airtight containers or freezer bags (*see footnote 3). Mark the contents and date on the containers. Store in the fridge for up to 2 days or in the freezer for up to three months.
Reheat
To reheat frozen rice, transfer it to a microwave-safe container without thawing. Cover and reheat the rice in 1-minute increments on full power, until rice is hot.

Add the milk into a small bowl and warm to approximately 100-110°F (38°C), about 30 seconds in the microwave. The milk should be warm, just a bit above body temperature. Add a pinch of sugar and the active dry yeast. Let sit for 5 minutes so the yeast will activate.
While the yeast activates, add the rest of the ingredients into your mixer bowl.
Once the yeast is activated, you should see bubbles on the surface of the mixture. Pour it into the mixer bowl. Mix with a spatula until the dough just comes together. Cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 20 minutes.
Install the dough hook on your mixer (I used a KitchenAid). Start at low speed, then gradually increase to setting 8 out of 10. Knead for 10 to 12 minutes, until the dough is very smooth. Stop the mixer in the middle and scrape the dough from the sides of the bowl. Test the dough by pulling a piece of it using both of your hands. It should stretch into a very thin and translucent sheet. The dough should be wet and a bit sticky.
Grease a big bowl with a thin layer of oil. Place the dough into the bowl. Cover with plastic wrap. Let rise until the dough doubles in size, about 1 hour.
2nd rise
Line a 9” x 9” (23cm x 23 cm) baking pan with parchment paper.
Punch the air out of the dough. Transfer it onto a lightly oiled working surface. Divide the dough into 9 even pieces by cutting it into 3 even strips, then further cutting each strip into 3 small pieces. Each piece of dough should weigh 68 to 70 grams.
Shape the dough one piece at a time. Tuck the dough onto itself by pinching the dough from all sides into the center using your fingers, creating a round shape. Then roll the dough in a circular motion with your palm against the table, until it forms a round ball. Place the dough balls onto the parchment paper, evenly spaced, in a 3-by-3 array.
Cover the baking pan with plastic wrap. Let rest again for another 35 to 45 minutes, until the size has doubled.
Bake
Preheat the oven to 350° F (176° C) while resting the shaped bread rolls.
Right before baking, gently brush a thin layer of milk onto the tops of the bread rolls.
Bake the milk bread rolls on the middle rack for 20 to 25 minutes, until the top turns golden brown. You can also test the doneness by inserting an instant-read thermometer into the middle of the center bun. It should register at least 190°F.
Let the bread rest in the pan for 5 minutes, then transfer it onto a cooling rack.
Serve warm or at room temperature.
Store
Once the milk bread rolls have cooled completely, you can store them in an airtight container on your kitchen counter for up to 2 days. The rolls will stay very soft at room temperature. You can also warm them up in the microwave it for 10 seconds or leave them in a 350° F (176° C) oven to warm up before serving.
For longer storage, place the dinner rolls in a ziplock bag, squeeze out as much air as possible, and store them in the freezer for up to a month.

Add rice and water to cover into a large bowl. Use your fingers to gently rinse the rice in a swirling motion, then drain the water. Add water to cover the rice with 1” (2 cm) of water. Soak at room temperature overnight. Drain thoroughly before cooking.
Prep
Heat 1 cup of water in the microwave until hot. Add the dried shiitake mushrooms. Soak until the mushrooms turn soft, 15 to 20 minutes. Once done, squeeze the liquid out of the mushrooms into the soaking water. Slice the mushrooms thinly. Reserve the soaking water for cooking.
Cut the rest of the ingredients while rehydrating the mushrooms.
Cook
Heat the butter in a 4-quart dutch oven (or tight-sealing heavy pot) over medium heat. When the butter has melted, add the shallot and shiitake mushrooms. Cook, stirring frequently, until the onions turn golden and translucent, 6 to 8 minutes.
Add the Chinese sausage. Cook and stir for 1 minute.
Pour in the Shaoxing wine. Use your spatula to release any brown bits stuck on the bottom of the pan. Cook until the wine has evaporated completely.
Add the rice. Stir to mix the rice evenly with the other ingredients. Add the chicken stock and salt. Stir to mix well.
Add the water chestnuts. Pour in the soy sauce and dark soy sauce. Gently stir a few times to mix the soy sauce.
Cook until the liquid comes to a low simmer. Turn to very low heat and cover the dutch oven. Steam until the rice is cooked through, 20 to 25 minutes. Uncover the pan and taste the rice at the 20-minute mark. If the rice still has a bit of a raw texture, let it cook for another 5 minutes.
Once done, uncover the pan and stir with a rice paddle or spatula to fluff the rice. Garnish the stuffing with sliced green onions.
Serve hot as a side.
This dish can be cooked 1 to 2 days in advance. Reheat it in the same dutch oven in a 350 ℉ (176 ℃) oven with the lid on until warm. You can reheat it in the microwave, too. To heat it evenly, be sure to stir the rice several times over the course of reheating.
Clean-up
It’s very likely that the sticky rice will stick to the bottom of the pot once you’re done cooking. This is due to the starchy texture and the added soy sauce.

When the dough has rested, transfer to a work surface and punch it down. Knead for 1 minute to deflate the air out completely, then form it back into a ball.
Cut the dough in half. Wrap half of the dough in plastic wrap and store in the fridge while working on the other half.
Poke a hole in the center of the dough you’re working with. Stretch the dough into a large oval by running your fingers along the inside of the hole in a circular motion. Once the diameter of the dough is about 1” (2.5 cm), tear apart the ring so it creates a long, thin strip.
Cut the dough strip into 12 even pieces by cutting it in half, then further cut each half into 6 pieces. Gently use a circular motion to round up each dough piece then flatten it with your palm. Cover them with plastic wrap to prevent drying out.
Work on one piece of dough at a time - take one dough piece and place in front of you. Roll it with a rolling pin in one hand, using the other hand to rotate the dough while rolling, until the diameter reaches 5” (13 cm). You should keep the edges thinner than the center, so the wrapper of the bun will be even once you make the pleats.
Place the rolled dough in your palm and add 1 tablespoon of filling in the center.
Start wrapping the bun by folding and pinching the edge over itself, in one direction, until it is almost sealed. Then rotate and pinch the top of the pleats to fully seal the bun. (View my video for more details)
Repeat with the remaining dough pieces to wrap all the buns. Keep the wrapped buns under a piece of plastic wrap to prevent drying out. Once done wrapping, let rest for 10 minutes. Once rested, you should cook the buns immediately. You can store the wrapped buns in a sealed container in the fridge for up to 1 hour before cooking.
Repeat the wrapping steps to wrap the other half of the dough.
To cook the buns:
Add 2 tablespoons of oil and carefully place 12 wrapped buns into a 9” or 10” skillet. Heat over medium-high heat until hot. Turn to medium heat. Cook, uncovered, for 3 minutes, until the bottoms are lightly browned.
Pour about 1/4 cup hot water into the pan, just enough to cover the buns halfway up. Cover the pan and cook over medium heat for about 8 minutes, until the water is completely evaporated.
Turn the heat to medium-low and cook for another 2 to 3 minutes. Turn the heat off and remove the pan from the stove. Let the buns rest with the lid on for an additional 2 minutes. Remove the lid and transfer to a plate. Repeat the steps to cook the rest of the buns.
Serve hot immediately.

Cook over medium-high heat until steam comes out of the steamer. Cook for 15 minutes, until the potatoes and chicken are cooked through. To test the doneness, insert a paring knife into a potato - it should pierce through without resistance. Insert the knife into the chicken and the juice should run clear. Continue to cook the chicken and / or the potatoes if either of them is not fully cooked.
Drain the potatoes and run cold tap water over them. Then transfer the potatoes to a big bowl and cover with cold tap water to let cool. (Optional) Once the potatoes are mostly cooled, transfer the potatoes onto a plate and place it in the fridge to let cool for another 20 minutes. (*Footnote 4)

Use your fingers to gently rinse the rice in a circular motion a few times, then drain off the water. Repeat 1 to 2 times.
Instant Pot Method
Add the rice and water to your Instant Pot. Cover and seal the lid. Select high pressure, and set the timer to 25 minutes. Once done, let the pressure release naturally.
Once the pressure has fully released, open the lid and stir the congee with a ladle. It might look thin once it’s done cooking, but it will thicken up a bit once you stir it well and let it sit for a few minutes. If you want to change the texture of the congee, turn on the “Saute” function and let it boil down for a few minutes and stir constantly, until it turns thicker. Or you can pour in a bit of hot water and stir it, to thin it out.
Stovetop Method
Add the rinsed rice and water to a medium-sized or big, tall pot. Bring to a boil over high heat. Stir a few times to make sure the rice doesn’t stick to the bottom.
Turn to medium-low or medium heat to reduce to a simmer. Cover the pot halfway to keep the water boiling without spilling over. Simmer for 45 to 50 minutes, depending on the texture you’re looking for. Stir the congee a few times during cooking. Towards the end of cooking, the congee will get quite thick and sticky. Stay near the pot and stir frequently over the last 10 to 15 minutes. It will easily spill if covered too much or if the heat is too high. The rice will stick to the bottom if you don’t stir enough.
Serve
Serve the congee hot or warm with any topping options you prefer. You can also replace steamed rice with the congee as a side, to serve with other dishes.
Store and reheat
You can store the congee in a sealed container in the fridge for 3 to 4 days. The congee will continue to thicken. To dilute it, you can add a splash of water to the congee and heat it either on the stovetop or in the microwave.",en-US,"{'servingSize': '1 serving', 'calories': '84 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '18.5 g', 'proteinContent': '1.7 g', 'fatContent': '0.2 g', 'sodiumContent': '10 mg', 'fiberContent': '0.3 g'}",-1.0,,Omnivore's Cookbook,123,4 serving(s)

Make the dough by hand - Put the flour in a large bowl, add dry yeast, and mix well with a fork. Add water and mix with a fork or a pair of chopsticks, stirring in a clockwise direction, until water is fully incorporated with flour. Dust both hands with flour and start by using one hand to knead until dough begins to form. The dough should be soft, but shouldn’t stick to the bottom of the bowl. Blend in more flour if the dough sticks to the hands, 1 teaspoon at a time. Dust a cutting board or working surface with flour and transfer the dough onto the cutting board. Continue kneading the dough for a few minutes, until the surface becomes smooth.
Make the dough using a food processor or mixer - Add the flour and the yeast into the food processor (or mixer), pulse a few times to mix well. Add the water and mix until it forms a dough. Transfer the dough onto a dusted working surface. Knead for a few minutes until the surface becomes smooth.
Make the dough using a Kitchenaid - Add the flour and the yeast into the Kitchenaid bowl. Mix on low for a few revolutions. Gradually add the water. Mix until it forms a smooth dough, 10 minutes or so.
Making the bread
Transfer the dough to a dusted bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Rest the dough for 10 to 15 minutes (*Footnote 1).
Dust both hands again and knead the dough a few times. Divide the dough into 10 equal parts, and shape each one into a ball by hand. Transfer the dough onto a dusted tray and cover with plastic wrap. Let rest for another 10 minutes.
Dust both hands and the working surface. Place one dough ball on the working surface, then press it with the palm into a round shape. Use a rolling pin to flatten the dough into a 1/4 inch (6-mm) thick round disk. Set aside. Shape the rest of the dough balls the same way.
Heat a cast iron pan or nonstick skillet with a few drops of oil over medium heat. When skillet is hot, turn to medium low heat. Place a round piece of dough into the skillet and cover the pan (cook one or two doughs at a time, depending on the size of the skillet). Use a spatula to turn the dough occasionally, 1 to 2 minutes per side, and cook covered during the process, until both sides turn golden brown and the bread is inflated.

How to Make Steamed Bao Buns (Gua Bao Buns),Maggie Zhu,https://omnivorescookbook.com/steamed-bao-buns/,Chinese,https://omnivorescookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/200820_Gua-Bao-Buns_550.jpg,"['290 g (2 cups) all-purpose flour', '3 g (1 teaspoon) instant yeast', '3 g (1 teaspoon) baking powder ((double-acting))', '10 g (2 teaspoons) sugar', '1/8 teaspoon salt', '180 ml (3/4 cups) full-fat milk (, cold or at room temperature)', 'Vegetable oil (, for brushing)']","Form the Dough + 1st rise
Combine the flour, yeast, baking powder, sugar, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer. Slowly pour in the milk while using a spoon or spatula to mix with the flour. Once the liquid is fully combined, turn on the mixer and knead for 5 minutes until it forms a firm and coarse dough ball. Alternatively, you can use your hands to knead the dough and it should take about 10 minutes.
Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the dough rest for 10 minutes.
After 10 minutes, knead the dough using your hands, for another minute, until smooth. Cover with plastic wrap. Rest the dough until it doubles in size, about 1 hour.
While the dough is rising, prepare 10 pieces of square parchment paper about the size of your palm, to hold the buns while steaming.
(Optional) If you’re making the gua bao filling and quick pickled shallots on the same day, prepare them during this time.
Divide the dough
Once the dough has doubled in size, punch the dough gently with your hand to release the air bubbles. Knead for 1 minute.
Cut the dough into 2 equal pieces, then further divide each piece into 5 smaller pieces. For a more accurate result, use a scale to measure the dough to make sure it’s 48 g per piece.
Work on the dough pieces one at a time, forming them into balls by pinching the loose ends into the base until taut and round. Then roll the dough on the table using your hand shaped like a dome, lightly pressing the dough so it forms a round ball. Place the dough balls on a large plate and cover them with plastic wrap to prevent them from drying out.
Shape the buns & 2nd rise
Place the dough balls pinched side down onto a clean working surface. Using a rolling pin, roll each ball into a 1/4"" (1/2 cm) thick oval that's twice as long as it is wide (about 2.25” x 4.5”/ 5.5 cm X 11 cm). Flip the dough oval over and lightly roll again to smooth it out,
Brush the top of the dough oval with a thin layer of oil (*Footnote 1), fold the oval in half, and place it on a piece of parchment paper you prepared earlier.
Place the shaped buns in a steamer basket, leaving at least 1” (2.5 cm) between the buns. Cover and let rise for another 15 to 30 minutes before cooking, or until the size is 1.5 times bigger.
Cook the buns
Right after you finish forming the first batch of buns, prepare the steamer by adding water into the base. When the buns have risen the 2nd time, add the covered steamer rack with the risen buns over the steamer. If using a metal steamer, use two layers of clean kitchen towels between the steamer rack and the lid to prevent water from dripping. Cook covered over medium heat until steam starts coming out of the pot, then turn to medium-low heat. Steam for another 10 minutes.
After 10 minutes, turn the heat off but leave the lid on for another 5 minutes. Do not open the lid at this time! The buns might deflate without the proper resting.
Once done, remove the buns onto a wire rack to cool. Then you can use the same steamer to cook the rest of your buns.
Workflow note
You probably will need to cook the buns in batches depending on the size of your steamer. While you’re steaming the first batch of the buns, the second batch or the third batch might have been formed and rested. In this case, transfer the buns onto a big plate and cover them with plastic wrap. Transfer the buns into the fridge to slow down the rising. Wait until the previous batch of buns is done. Remove the rested buns from the fridge, let them return to room temperature for 2 minutes, then start steaming them. It’s important to NOT allow the buns to rise too much. If the buns are rested for too long, they will deflate once steamed.
Serve, store & reheat
Once the buns are steamed and slightly cooled, you can use them to make gua bao, serve them with moo shu chicken, or stuff them with any braised meat.
You can store the steamed buns in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 4 days, or in a tightly sealed ziplock bag in the freezer for up to 3 months.
To reheat the refrigerated buns, you can place the buns on a plate and cover them with a layer of wet paper towels, then heat them up in the microwave. You can also heat the buns in a steamer, which will create a softer result.
To reheat the frozen buns, place them directly in a steamer without thawing them and steam until fully heated through. If you want to reheat them in the microwave, you should thaw the buns first.",en-US,"{'servingSize': '1 serving', 'calories': '118 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '24 g', 'proteinContent': '3.5 g', 'fatContent': '0.6 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '0.2 g', 'cholesterolContent': '1 mg', 'sodiumContent': '37 mg', 'fiberContent': '0.9 g', 'sugarContent': '1 g'}",5.0,,Omnivore's Cookbook,140,10 serving(s)

Cook over medium heat until bringing to a boil. Turn to medium-low heat. Simmer for 10 minutes. Remove the pot from your stove and let cool completely. Once done, remove and discard the tea bags.
To boil the eggs, heat a pot of water (enough to cover all the eggs) over high heat until boiling. Turn to low heat. Carefully place the eggs in the pot using a ladle, to prevent the eggs from cracking.
Boil 5 minutes for soft-boiled eggs, 7 minutes for medium eggs, or 10 minutes for hard-boiled eggs.
While cooking the eggs, prepare an ice bath by combining ice and tap water in a big bowl.
Once the eggs are cooked, immediately transfer them to the ice bath to cool for 2 to 3 minutes. If you don’t have ice on hand, simply run cool tap water over the eggs for a couple minutes until they cool down.
Gently crack the eggs using the back of a spoon. You want to make sure the egg shells are cracked enough so the marinade will reach the interior, without cracking the eggs apart (especially if you made soft boiled eggs). If you’re in a hurry, you can also peel the eggs and marinate them peeled. The eggs will be ready in 12 hours this way.
Transfer the eggs to a quart-size ziplock bag, then carefully pour in the marinade along with the dry ingredients. Marinate overnight for peeled eggs, or 24 hours for cracked “marble” eggs.
Peel the eggs and enjoy them cold or at room temperature!
You can store the leftover eggs in the marinade for 4 to 5 days in the fridge. The marinade will help with preserving the eggs.
