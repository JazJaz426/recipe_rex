Gently rinse the dried lily flower buds, wood ear mushrooms, and shiitake mushrooms with tap water and transfer them into three bowls. Add 1/2 cup hot water to each bowl to cover. Let soak until tender throughout, 30 minutes or so. Once done, squeeze out the marinating liquid back into the bowls and gently rinse them with tap water again to remove any dust on the surface. Slice the shitake mushrooms. Cut the lily flowers in half. And chop the wood ear mushrooms into small pieces. Reserve the marinating liquid from the shiitake mushrooms and lily flowers for the gravy.
Prepare gravy
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the Sichuan peppercorns. Cook, stirring occasionally, until you can smell a strong fragrance and the peppercorns turn darker (but not black). Scoop out the Sichuan peppercorns and discard them (*Footnote 1).
Add the rehydrated lily flowers, shiitake mushrooms, and wood ear mushrooms. Cook, stirring frequently, for 1 minute or so. Be careful, the rehydrated ingredients might cause oil splatter.
Add the white part of the green onion and the ginger. Cook and stir for 30 seconds to release the fragrance.
Move everything to one side of the pan and add the remaining 1/2 tablespoon oil to the other side. Add the ground pork on top of the oil, then use a spatula to spread it out. Let the pork cook for a minute without moving to brown the bottom, then cut it into small pieces.
When the pork is cooked through, pour in the Shaoxing wine and scrape the pan to release any brown bits.
Pour in the light soy sauce and dark soy sauce. Stir to coat well.
Add the water and the reserved 1 cup of soaking water. And the chicken bouillon powder. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally, and cook for 2 minutes.
Meanwhile, dissolve the cornstarch in 1 tablespoon of water in a small bowl. Pour the cornstarch slurry into the pan. Stir to mix well and let cook until the sauce thickens. Taste the gravy and adjust the seasoning by adding a pinch of salt, if needed.
Serve
To serve, scoop the tofu pudding using a large spoon (the larger and flatter, the better) into two serving bowls.

Prepare a heat-proof bowl or container that can fit in your steamer. It can be a big wide bowl that’s about 24 oz (700 ml) or two 12-oz (350 ml) ramekins. (*Footnote 3)
Using a fine mesh strainer, strain the eggs into the bowl you prepared. If there are any bubbles on the surface, use a spoon to gently scoop them off. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and poke a few small holes in it.
Reduce the heat of the steamer to medium-low. Carefully transfer the bowl with the egg into the steamer.

Cut butter and shortening into 1/2” (1 cm) squares and put them in a medium-sized bowl. Transfer into freezer until hard, 15 minutes or so.
Line a strainer mesh srainer over a large bowl. Sift the flour over the strainer. Add the baking powder and salt. Stir to mix well.
Once the butter and shortening are fully chilled, add them into the flour mixture. Cut with a pastry cutter or using your fingers, until the mixture is mealy with some pea-sized chunks of butter.
Pour in the cold buttermilk. Stir with a spatula until a craggy dough forms. Add most of the green onion, saving about 2 to 3 tablespoons of it for garnish.
Lightly knead the dough in the bowl with your hand until it forms a dough ball, about 1 minute.
Chill the dough in the freezer for about 10 minutes, or cover with plastic wrap and chill in the fridge until ready to use.
Cook the biscuits
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (232 C).
Dust your working surface with a thin layer of flour. Transfer the chilled dough onto it. Press the dough into a flat square. Cut the dough in half and fold it over itself. Repeat one more time.
Roll the dough with a rolling pin into a 1” (2.5 cm) thick sheet. Use a biscuit cutter to cut the dough into circles or you can use a knife to cut the dough into 2” (5 cm) squares. If using a biscuit cutter, you will have leftover dough. Gently gather the leftover dough together and press it until it just becomes one piece of dough (The more you handle the dough, the less it will rise during baking). Cut it into more biscuits.
Brush the top of the biscuits with a thin layer of milk.
Bake for 13 to 16 minutes, until the top turns light golden and the bottom turns golden brown.
Gravy
Add the char siu drippings into a small saucepan. Heat over medium heat until hot.
Add the flour. Stir immediately until it’s fully incorporated.
Gradually add the stock, a few tablespoons at a time, and whisk constantly. It should start to form a thick paste. Once the paste turns smooth, add more stock and keep whisking. Continue until all the stock is fully incorporated with the flour.
Keep stirring and cooking, until the sauce has thickened enough to coat your spatula.
Add the char siu and the soy sauce. Cook for another minute until the meat is heated through. Taste the gravy. Add a pinch of salt and stir to mix well, if needed.
To serve
Sprinkle the remaining green onion onto the gravy and serve it with the fresh biscuits.

Combine the eggs, salt, sugar, soy sauce, and Shaoxing wine in a large deep bowl. Blend with a hand mixer until smooth. This can be done with a whisk or fork, but it will take longer and won’t be as smooth.

Moisten the inside of a heatproof glass container (mine was about 5” x 5”) with some water. Carefully line the inside with plastic wrap - the moisture inside should help the plastic wrap stick nicely. You want as smooth a surface as possible.
Pour the egg mixture through a strainer into the glass dish, avoiding adding foam as much as possible. Skim the foam from the surface of the egg mixture.
Set up a steamer and steam the egg mixture for 9 minutes. Remove the glass container and let the steamed eggs cool completely in the fridge, 5 to 6 hours.

On a clean working surface, knead the dough the second time for another 2 minutes. Cover it with plastic again and let it rest for at least 2 hours or overnight in the fridge (*See Footnote 1).
Make donuts (see the blog post above for step pictures)
While heating the oil, prepare the donut dough: Divide the dough into two even pieces. Work on them one at a time.
On a lightly oiled surface, roll the dough into a long strip. You can use your hands to hold both ends of the dough and stretch it gently so it’s easier to form a long shape. Once the dough is 4” (10 cm) wide and 1/4” (0.5 cm) thick, cut off both ends so it forms a rectangle.
Cut across the rectangular sheet, making 1” (2.5 cm) width 4” (10 cm) rectangles.
Dip a skewer or the back of a knife into water. Press it into the center of half of the rectangles. Place the unpressed strips on top of the the pressed strips and press into the center again, so the two pieces of dough are attached to each other. (*Footnote 2)
Once the donuts are formed, let them rest for another 10 minutes.
Fry the donuts
Heat a tall medium-sized pot with 3” (7 cm) of oil over medium heat until it reaches 375 °F (190 °C).
Line a cooling rack on top of a baking sheet.
Work on the donuts one at a time. Use your fingers to pinch the two ends, and gently stretch it into a thin long strip that is about 8” (20 cm) long. Then gently lower it into the oil. You can cook 2 to 3 donuts at a time, depending on the size of your pot.
Cook each side for 2 minutes or so, until it turns golden color for a soft crispy texture, or a golden brown color for a crispier texture.
Use a pair of tongs to remove the donuts from the oil, gently shake off the excess oil, then transfer them onto the cooling rack.
Enjoy the donuts while they’re hot or warm.
Store
To store the leftover donuts, wait until they cool down completely, then transfer them into a ziplock bag. Store them in the fridge for 2 to 3 days or in the freezer for up to a month.
To reheat the donuts, preheat the oven to 400 °F (200 °C).

Serve the hot pancakes with whipped cream, mixed berries, and / or maple syrup, if needed.

Combine the minced ginger and hot water in a small bowl. Stir to mix well and set aside.
Prepare the dough
In a large tall plate or a big bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, cornstarch, instant yeast and sugar. Stir to mix well.
Slowly pour in the warm water, a few tablespoons at a time, and mix with a pair of chopsticks (or a fork). Once all the water has been added, keep mixing and scrape off the dry flour on the side of the bowl, until it forms many small dough flakes.
Pour in the vegetable oil. Keep mixing with the chopsticks until the oil is absorbed.
Start kneading by hand while further incorporating the dry flour, until there’s no dry flour left in the bowl.
Transfer the dough onto a working surface. Knead for 15 to 20 minutes, until the dough is quite smooth and elastic and there’s no dry flour left in the bowl. It’s OK if there’s some unevenness in the dough, which will smooth out after resting. The dough should be quite tough and not sticky to the touch. Cover and seal the bowl with plastic wrap. Let rest until it doubles in size, 1 hour or so.
Prepare the filling
Add the ginger water, light and dark soy sauce, Shaoxing wine, salt, sugar, and white pepper to the ground pork in a large bowl. Beat with a pair of chopsticks or a wooden spatula in a circular motion, until all the liquid is absorbed and the meat is sticky. This process might take a few minutes. (*Footnote 4)
Add the green onions and sesame oil. Mix until they are incorporated. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Store in the fridge until ready to use.
Assemble the buns
When the dough has rested, transfer to a work surface and punch it down. Knead for 1 minute to deflate the air out completely, then form it back into a ball.
Cut the dough in half. Wrap half of the dough in plastic wrap and store in the fridge while working on the other half.
Poke a hole in the center of the dough you’re working with. Stretch the dough into a large oval by running your fingers along the inside of the hole in a circular motion. Once the diameter of the dough is about 1” (2.5 cm), tear apart the ring so it creates a long, thin strip.
Cut the dough strip into 12 even pieces by cutting it in half, then further cut each half into 6 pieces. Gently use a circular motion to round up each dough piece then flatten it with your palm. Cover them with plastic wrap to prevent drying out.
Work on one piece of dough at a time - take one dough piece and place in front of you. Roll it with a rolling pin in one hand, using the other hand to rotate the dough while rolling, until the diameter reaches 5” (13 cm). You should keep the edges thinner than the center, so the wrapper of the bun will be even once you make the pleats.
Place the rolled dough in your palm and add 1 tablespoon of filling in the center.
Start wrapping the bun by folding and pinching the edge over itself, in one direction, until it is almost sealed. Then rotate and pinch the top of the pleats to fully seal the bun. (View my video for more details)
Repeat with the remaining dough pieces to wrap all the buns. Keep the wrapped buns under a piece of plastic wrap to prevent drying out. Once done wrapping, let rest for 10 minutes. Once rested, you should cook the buns immediately. You can store the wrapped buns in a sealed container in the fridge for up to 1 hour before cooking.
Repeat the wrapping steps to wrap the other half of the dough.
To cook the buns:
Add 2 tablespoons of oil and carefully place 12 wrapped buns into a 9” or 10” skillet. Heat over medium-high heat until hot. Turn to medium heat. Cook, uncovered, for 3 minutes, until the bottoms are lightly browned.
Pour about 1/4 cup hot water into the pan, just enough to cover the buns halfway up. Cover the pan and cook over medium heat for about 8 minutes, until the water is completely evaporated.
Turn the heat to medium-low and cook for another 2 to 3 minutes. Turn the heat off and remove the pan from the stove. Let the buns rest with the lid on for an additional 2 minutes. Remove the lid and transfer to a plate. Repeat the steps to cook the rest of the buns.
Serve hot immediately. (*Footnote 5) Or you can store the cooked buns in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 4 days or in the freezer for up to 3 months.",en-US,"{'servingSize': '1 bun', 'calories': '74 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '10.8 g', 'proteinContent': '3.7 g', 'fatContent': '1.7 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '0.3 g', 'cholesterolContent': '7 mg', 'sodiumContent': '85 mg', 'fiberContent': '0.5 g', 'sugarContent': '0.4 g'}",4.5,,Omnivore's Cookbook,150,24 serving(s)
