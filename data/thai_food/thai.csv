Squid fried with shrimp paste recipe,Mark Wiens (https://www.eatingthaifood.com/),https://www.eatingthaifood.com/thai-squid-shrimp-paste-recipe/,Thai,http://migrationology.smugmug.com/Thai-Recipes/i-FjHxVbv/0/X3/thai-squid-recipe-24-X3.jpg,"['250 grams squid (ปลาหมึก)', '1 head garlic (กระเทียม)', '1 tbsp peppercorns (พริกไทยดำ)', '3 stalks green onion (ต้นหอม)', '¼ tbsp shrimp paste (กะปิ)', '1 tbsp oyster sauce (น้ำมันหอย)', '3 tbsp oil for stir frying (น้ำมัน)']","This is a quick stir fry recipe, so the most important thing is to prepare all your ingredients before you get started.
Prepare the squid by removing the head, cutting out the eyes, and removing all the internal organs of the squid, and discarding the inner cuttlebone – which is like a piece of plastic. Rinse the squid in water, then slice the body of the squid into rings, and cut the tentacles into bite sized pieces.
Using a mortar and pestle, pound the black peppercorns for a few seconds until broken, but not powdery. Then add the garlic, and pound just for a few seconds to bruise the cloves.
For the green onions, cut off the roots, then slice into bite sized pieces about 5 cm in length.
Heat your wok or frying pan to high heat, then add oil to the pan.
Wait until the oil is hot, then toss in the black pepper and garlic, and stir fry for a few seconds.
Add the shrimp paste, and mix and mush into the oil, making sure it begins to dissolve and turn fragrant.
Once the garlic starts to turn golden brown, add the squid, and stir fry continuously for about a minute.
Season with oyster sauce, and continue stir frying.
Stir fry the squid for about 3 minutes altogether, making sure not to overcook it, or it will turn rubbery.
When the squid is fully cooked, the final step is to add the green onions, mix through once, then turn off the fire or heat of your stove. The green onions will still be slightly raw, but will continue to cook with the other hot ingredients.

Southern Thai Gaeng Som Recipe – Sour Fish Soup,Mark Wiens (https://www.eatingthaifood.com/),https://www.eatingthaifood.com/thai-gaeng-som-recipe/,Thai,https://www.eatingthaifood.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/thai-gaeng-som-recipe-300x200.jpg,"['1 Barramundi fish, or other ocean water fish (ปลากระพง) – My fish was approximately 600 grams, but you could add more or less as you please.', '1.5 – 2 liters of water (น้ำเปล่า)', '1 green papaya (มะละกอดิบ) – mine was about 700 grams in total and I used the whole papaya', '1 tbsp shrimp paste (กะปิ)', '1 tbsp salt, or the amount to taste (เกลือ)', '10 – 15 tbsp lime juice (น้ำมะนาว) – I used the juice from about 20 limes', '60 grams bird’s eye chilies (พริกขี้หนูขาว), preferably the lighter colored ones, but any will do – I used over 100 chilies for this recipe', '1 head garlic (กระเทียม)', '20 grams turmeric (ขมิ้น) 2 – 3 finger sized pieces', '2 shallots (หอมแดง)', '300 ml water – to blend with the curry paste ingredients']","Begin by making the curry paste. Peel the stems off all the chilies, then add them to a blender or food processor.
Peel the garlic, and shallots, and cut the turmeric into pieces, and toss them all into the blender.
Add about a cup of water, and blend for a few seconds until pureed.
NOTE: Be warned that turmeric stains, so don’t use a nice blender!
To prepare the green papaya, first peel the outer green skin, rinse it in water to remove the sap, then shave off thin bite sized pieces of papaya so you have thin wedges. Cut the papaya like you’re whittling a piece of wood. Then set aside.
For the limes, slice and squeeze them into a separate bowl.
Put a big soup pot on the stove and turn to medium heat, and add in all the curry paste you just blended.
Add 2 liters of water to the soup, using some of the water to rinse out the blender, and add to the pot.
Add the shrimp paste, and stir the soup to make sure the shrimp paste fully dissolves.
Take the green papaya, add it all to the soup, stir quickly, then put the cover on to bring to a boil.
Once the gaeng som is boiling, gently add the pieces of fish.
But here’s the Thai Aunty trick – don’t stir the soup until the fish is fully cooked. If you stir the soup when the fish is still raw, your soup will taste fishy (according to Thai cooking practice).
Boil the soup, without stirring, for about 5 – 8 minutes.
When the fish is finished cooking, you can stir gently, and then turn off the stove pretty quickly so you don’t overcook the fish.
Once your heat is off, it’s time to season with salt and lime juice. Add some at first, stir gently, taste test, then add more if needed.

Thai grilled fish recipe (pla pao ปลาเผา),Mark Wiens (https://www.eatingthaifood.com/),https://www.eatingthaifood.com/thai-grilled-fish-recipe-pla-pao/,Thai,https://www.eatingthaifood.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/thai-grilled-fish-recipe-feature-300x199.jpg,"['2 whole fish (also 1 fish works fine, just reduce ingredients)', '½ kilo of salt (big grain if possible)', '2 tablespoons of all purpose flour', 'About 1 tablespoon of water', '4 – 6 stalks lemongrass', 'small handful of kaffir lime leaves', '6 tablespoons fresh lime juice', '3 tablespoons water', '2 tablespoons fish sauce', '1 tablespoon sugar', '½ teaspoon of salt', '15 cloves of garlic', '20 Thai bird chilies (prik kee noo suan พริกขี้หนูสวน)']","When you buy your whole fish, ask the vendor (or yourself) to do two things: One, try to remove the guts from the gills of the fish, without slicing the fish open on the belly, and two, leave the scales on the fish (if you have the choice).
Probably the first thing you want to do (if you’re using charcoal, which I would recommend), is to get the charcoal going first, so it’s ready when the fish is prepared.
Make sure you rinse your fish with water and then pat them dry with a paper towel.
Take your lemongrass stalks and beat and bruise them with something hard, like a mortar, or a rolling pin or something like that. This is going to bring out the lovely flavor of the lemongrass. Also prepare a small handful of kaffir lime leaves.
Fold the lemongrass in half and begin to stuff the fish with a stalk of lemongrass and about 10 kaffir lime leaves. Depending on how big your fish is will determine how many stalks of lemongrass you can fit. I put 2 – 3 lemongrass stalks in each fish in the video. Make sure it’s tight, but also make sure not to push so hard that you break the flesh of the fish.
In a large mixing bowl or pan add ½ kilo bag of salt, sprinkle in 2 tablespoons of all purpose flour, and add about 1 tablespoon of water. Mix it up thoroughly, massaging the mixture with your hand, until it’s fully mixed. You want the salt to be a little moist so it sticks to the fish easily.
Add the fish to the pan and start plastering it with the salt mixture. Pat and rub the fish with the salt, making sure to cover the entire fish, and all over the head and tail. Do the same to both fish.
For grilling the fish, you want to have a steady, yet quite low heat. Make sure you have a bed of coals, and if they are too hot you can either tone them down with a scoop of ashes, or push the really hot coals to one side of the grill and put the fish on the other side (using a little indirect heat). You can also add more coals as you keep on cooking. You want to slow cook the fish without them burning on the outside. My fish took almost 1 hour to grill. So aim for low heat for slow cooking.
Once your fish is on the grill, it’s time to get started on the seafood sauce (below).
Try to wait for about 15 minutes before you flip the fish. If you flip it too early, when the salt hasn’t dried out completely yet, the fish skin might get stuck onto the griddle. Flip the fish as little as possible.
Keep roasting until the fish feels firm and the white salted skin has turned crusty and golden. It should take about 45 minutes to 1 hour.
Take the fish off the grill, and set it on a platter.
To eat the fish, you can either use a knife or scissors, and from the top of the fish, cut through the skin. The skin should cleanly lift off the fish revealing moist and beautiful meat.
Thai grille fish (pla pao) is delicious with both sticky rice and white rice, and lots of seafood sauce!
Peel about 15 cloves of garlic and grab about 20 Thai bird chilies (prik kee noo suan พริกขี้หนูสวน). Normal Thai chilies will work too. Pound ½ teaspoon of salt, the garlic, and chilies using a mortar and pestle. Doesn’t need to be super fine, but make sure there are no big chunks.
In a bowl, add the pounded garlic and chilies, 6 tablespoons of fresh squeezed lime juice, 3 tablespoons of water, 2.5 tablespoons of fish sauce, and 1 tablespoon of sugar. Mix everything together until the sugar is dissolved.
Taste the seafood sauce. Really, it’s up to you how it tastes, but you want it to be slightly salty, sour, and slightly sweet.

Alternatively, you can soak for at least 4 – 5 hours, but overnight is best.
Take the sticky rice out of the water (and the grains should be softer and a little swollen), and place into a bamboo steamer, or any type of steamer. Cover the steamer with either a lid, or you can do what I did and cover the basket with a cloth, then a metal lid – just to keep all the steam within the rice.
Add water to a pot with the steamer over the pot (just make sure the water doesn’t touch the sticky rice), and once the water comes to a boil, steam for 15 – 20 minutes (usually 15 minutes for me is perfect) on a medium heat.
After 15 minutes take off the lid carefully, because it will be very hot, and just grab a taste test of the sticky rice to make sure it’s soft and fluffy. If it’s still a little crunchy, steam for a few more minutes, but if it’s good to go, turn off the heat and either eat immediately, or transfer to some sort of airtight container or basket to hold until you’re ready to eat.

To grind the sticky rice into powder, you can either do it by hand using a mortar and pestle, or you can grind it in a food processor or blender. You’re looking for a course powder.

Authentic Thai Grilled Chicken Recipe (Gai Yang ไก่ย่าง),Mark Wiens (https://www.eatingthaifood.com/),https://www.eatingthaifood.com/authentic-thai-grilled-chicken-recipe-gai-yang/,Thai,https://migrationology.smugmug.com/Blog-Posts/i-N6dK5md/0/X2/chicken-grilling-X2.jpg,"['2 whole chickens (mine were 1.8 kilos each)', 'Bamboo sticks or skewers', 'Charcoal', 'Grill', '4 tablespoons soy sauce', '1 tablespoon fish sauce', '2 tablespoons palm sugar', '1 tablespoon sweet dark soy sauce (you can use kecap manis)', '8 tablespoons water', '4 heads garlic (30 – 40 cloves)', '2 stalks lemongrass', '2.5 tablespoons black pepper corns', '8 fresh coriander roots (or you can try the powder coriander roots)', '1.5 tablespoons khao kua (see method here)', '1.5 tablespoons chili flakes', '1 tablespoon of sugar', '3 tablespoons fish sauce', '8 tablespoons tamarind juice (you can add more or less according to how strong it is and how sweet and sour you want your sauce)', 'Few sprigs of cilantro']","For this recipe, I’m going to cook 2 full chickens, together weighing in at 3.6 kilos. If you wanted, you could also make this recipe with 3 – 4 kilos of chicken pieces, or really, however much chicken you want.
For this gai yang (ไก่ย่าง) to be at its finest, it’s best to marinate the chicken overnight and grill it the next day, but if you don’t have the time, marinate the chicken for at least a few hours.
Peel about 4 bulbs of garlic, which should be about 30 – 40 cloves in all.
Thinly slice 2 stalks of lemongrass and cut off the roots of 8 stalks of coriander.
Now comes the hard part, pounding everything using a mortar and pestle (If you don’t have a mortar and pestle you can blend the ingredients in a food processor (but I’d really recommend you invest in a Thai style mortar and pestle).
Add small amounts of garlic, lemongrass, black peppercorns, and coriander roots to the mortar and pestle and pound them until the oils come out, and you have a coarse paste. Keep pounding until all the marinade ingredients are finished. You’ll probably need to load the mortar a few times.
Put all the pounded marinade ingredients in a mixing bowl, stir them up, and add 4 tablespoons of light soy sauce, 1 tablespoon of dark soy sauce, 1 tablespoon of fish sauce, and 2 tablespoons of palm sugar. Mix everything together while adding about 8 tablespoons of water to the mixture. You should end up with a potent marinade that looks like a chunky garlicky sauce.
If you’re using whole chickens, you’ll want to butterfly cut them starting from the breast side down to the butt. Flatten the chickens out. This is going to prepare it for the grill (Watch the video to see how to do it).
In a big pan or mixing bowl start to rub the marinade on the chicken, making sure the garlic, herbs, and soy sauce go into all parts of the chicken. Rub down both chickens using all the marinade.
Cover the chickens and allow them to rest overnight. You might stir them a couple of times if you remember.
The next day, take out your chicken, and the first step is to light your charcoal. You want a low even heat, coals that aren’t too hot, but a low and even.
Put the chicken on the grill and begin cooking!
Wait about 20 minutes or so (but monitoring them to make sure they don’t burn), before making your first flip. You can baste the chicken with the extra marinade.
Cook the chicken on low heat for about 1.5 hours, until the chicken is cooked through to the bone and the skin is golden dark brown on the outside.
Take the chicken off the grill, and dismantle the bamboo supports.
If you have a Chinese cleaver, first cut the chicken in half from the neck to the butt, and from there cut off the drumstick, wing, and chop the rest of the chicken into strips.
Semi-dried tamarind pulp can usually be bought at the supermarket in a small block. To rehydrate it, get a couple tablespoons of hot water and start to work the tamarind into the hot water. This should turn it into a nice tamarind water sauce.
In a bowl, mix 1.5 tablespoons of khao kua (toasted sticky rice, recipe here), 1.5 tablespoons of chili flakes, 1 tablespoon of sugar, 3 tablespoons of fish sauce, and 8 tablespoons of tamarind juice.
Mix all of the ingredients together.
After mixing up the sauce, make sure you taste test. You’re looking for the perfect sweet, sour, and salty combination. You might need to add more tamarind juice, more sugar, or more fish sauce to balance it out.
Top off your gai yang sauce with some chopped up cilantro.

Peel then mince 3 cloves of garlic, slice the chicken into small bite sized pieces, and slice the Chinese broccoli into 1.5 centimeter strips.
Heat the wok (or frying pan) on a medium heat and add about 2 tablespoons of oil.
Wait until the oil is hot, and then fry the garlic for about 10 seconds or so, making sure it sizzles in the hot oil.
Add the chopped chicken to the wok and stir fry for it about a minute until the chicken is nearly all the way white in color and cooked pretty well though and through.
Now, turn down your heat (or if you’re using an electric stove you can even move your pan off the burner for a moment).
Toss in the rice noodles, the Chinese broccoli, 1 tablespoon of light soy sauce, ½ tablespoon of dark soy sauce, and a ½ teaspoon of sugar.
Still on low heat, start to fold the noodles gently by picking them up with the spatula from the bottom, and folding them over (If you stir fry too hard, the stickiness from the noodles can make them turn into a big noodle blob – believe me, I’ve done this too many times and it’s not pretty!).
Cook the noodles for about 1 -2 minutes. If it gets a little dry, you can drizzle in a tiny bit of oil.
After the noodles are well mixed, scoot the noodles to one side of the wok, and proceed to crack an egg into the empty side.
Now it’s time to crank up the heat on your stove – for the final step we want a little char on the noodles and egg for great flavor.
Scramble the egg, and then fold the noodles onto the egg, sort of when it’s half cooked. Let the heat sear the egg for a few seconds and then start folding the noodles and egg together. With a hot flaming fire, you should get a little char to both the noodles and the egg.
Fry for about 30 more seconds, making sure to be gentle with the noodles, and then turn off the heat and dish it out.

It can be a little tough, so you might have to hit the top of your knife with your palm.
Next grab your lemongrass, slice off the bottoms, pull off the outer skin layer, and then slice it diagonally into about 1 inch strips. This is just going to help release its amazing fragrance.
Turn on your stove to medium heat, and add about 3 cups (or ½) of the coconut milk to a medium sized saucepan. Put the pot on the heat and immediately toss in the sliced galangal and lemongrass.
As your coconut milk begins to heat, move back over to your cutting board and slice up the chicken. I used 2 chicken breasts for this recipe. Slice the chicken into medium sized chunks – they can be kind of big in size.
Just before the coconut milk comes to a boil, add the chicken, and then add the other remaining 3 cups of coconut milk. Now, turn down the heat to a medium low, as you don’t want the coconut milk to heat too fast or burn.
Prepare your Thai chilies by peeling off the stems and then just slice them diagonally. Go ahead and add them directly to the soup.
Give the soup a quick stir, and then add about 200 grams of oyster mushrooms (it was about 2 handfuls for me).
Your coconut milk should not boil, but just maintain a nice low heat. Because coconut milk is so delicate, when you stir, be sure to move your spoon in 1 direction only, otherwise you run the risk of the coconut milk getting too shaken and it will start to curdle. Be gentle with the coconut milk.
Move back over to your cutting board and peel and slice 2 small white onions into thick wedges (if your onion is really big, just use 1). Immediately toss the onions into the soup.
Next, cut your tomatoes in the same way as your onions, into thick wedges. Wait until your tom kha gai (ต้มข่าไก่) is just about to boil, and then add the tomatoes.
Take the kaffir lime leaves, break them with your hand, and toss them directly into the soup. Breaking the kaffir lime leaves is going to release their flavor.
Now add about ½ teaspoon of salt to begin with (taste to add more)
Mix your tom kha gai slowly and gently, for about 5 – 10 minutes, making sure it doesn’t come to a full boil – and if it does – turn down the heat to even lower. You want the chicken, onions, tomatoes, and other ingredients to be fully cooked, but you don’t want to overcook the coconut milk.
After about 5 – 10 minutes of cooking, go ahead and turn off the heat completely.
Go back to your cutting board, slice up a handful of fresh cilantro, and add it to the soup. Give it a quick stir, and the cilantro will cook enough from the already hot soup.
The final step is to juice a couple of limes into a separate bowl and then add about 4 tablespoons of lime juice to the tom kha gai (ต้มข่าไก่). Again, just give it a quick and gentle stir, and it’s ready to be served.
Make sure you do some taste-testing to make sure it’s salty and sour enough. You may need to add a little extra salt or lime juice to get the flavor you want.",en,{},4.6,,"Thai Street Food, Restaurants, and Recipes | Eating Thai Food",30,3 – 4

Doesn’t need to be too small or evenly cut, this is just going to make it easier to pound. Set them all aside on a plate.
For the lemongrass, first remove two or three of the outermost layers (the outer layers of the lemongrass are tough and not flavorful). Start from the bottom (thicker side) of the stalk and cut off the end, and then slice it into thin slivers, about half the way to the top. Toss out the top half of the lemongrass stalk as its not flavorful and it’s tough also. Set it aside.
Take your kaffir lime and carefully slice off the outer green bumpy skin. You want to slice only the outer green skin, without getting the white pith. Cut the green skin off about half of the lime.
Using a mortar and pestle, start pounding the dry Thai chilies first. They might be a little bouncy as they are dry, but the more you keep on pounding them, the more they will loosen up and their oils will start to form.
Once you’ve pounded the dry chilies for about 10 minutes, add the fresh Thai bird chilies – you can add the stem and all. This may help add some moisture to your curry paste. Keep pounding, maybe for about 15 minutes or so, until the chilies are broken down.
Start adding pieces of turmeric, garlic, and shallots to your curry paste, and keep on pounding and pounding. If your mortar and pestle isn’t big enough, you may need to put some of your paste into a separate bowl and do a couple batches.
Gradually add in all the lemongrass and the kaffir lime peel and keep on pounding. It took me over an hour to pound this southern Thai curry paste. You don’t want any chunks, and you want to fully release the oils of all the ingredients – that’s when you’re going to get the best flavor out of your paste.
Your curry paste should be a nice oily buttery consistency and quite smooth when you’re done. Then add the black peppercorns, and salt, and keep pounding until the peppercorns are completely pounded in. Keep on pounding until you have a beautiful pasty blob.
The final step is to add the shrimp paste. Pound it slowly, more mashing it into the paste. It should get quite a bit stickier and dryer with the addition of the shrimp paste. Once the shrimp paste is fully mixed in, your curry paste is ready.",en,{},4.8,,"Thai Street Food, Restaurants, and Recipes | Eating Thai Food",90,None

To prepare your fish, you want to make sure it’s already de-scaled, and also that the insides have been removed – you can either do it yourself, or it might be easier to have the butcher do it when you buy it.
Take the fish, and you want to make three diagonal slices on the fillet of the fish, make sure you cut through the skin, but don’t go too deep into the flesh.
Next you’ll need a big bowl or basin and go ahead and put the fish in.
Take some salt, and give each of the fish a small sprinkle on both sides, and rub your hands over the salt to make sure it’s spread evenly over the skin of the fish.
Grab the turmeric garlic mixture and start piling it onto the fish, all of it. You can gently massage the fish, mostly to make sure every part of the fish is coated in orange goodness. Also, take some of that turmeric and garlic and really stuff it into the slits we made in the side of the fish – this will ensure the flavor gets embedded in the fish.
Set aside the fish, and leave it to sit for about 10 – 15 minutes.
While you’re waiting for the fish to marinate for a few minutes, you can prepare your oil for deep frying.
Turn on your stove to a medium heat and add about 1 liter of oil (however much you think you need) to your pot or wok.
We’re going to fry the fish first, and then the garlic and turmeric, so first shake off all the garlic and turmeric from the fish, and leave it in the basin for later (this is because the fish will take longer to fry, so we’ll fry the fish first, then the garlic and turmeric after).
Make sure your oil is fully hot, and then gently slide the fish into the oil carefully. They should immediately start to sizzle up and bubble.
Fry the fish for about 5 – 8 minutes on each side, but it will really depend on the size of your fish – so if your fish is bigger you’ll need more time. While it fries, make sure you carefully scrape the bottom of your pan with a spatula to make sure your fish doesn’t stick.
When your fish looks nice and golden brown on the bottom side, it’s time to flip it over, and again, fry it for about 5 – 8 minutes on the other side.
Keep monitoring your fish closely, making sure it doesn’t stick.
When the fish is brown and golden, and you think it’s fully cooked through, take it out of the oil, and set it in a strainer to drain.
Now we’re going to fry the garlic and turmeric. Keep your stove on a medium heat, a carefully drop in all the garlic and turmeric. It will probably bubble up, then settle down.
Slowly and carefully stir with your spatula, making sure nothing sticks and the garlic and turmeric is fries nice and evenly.
The garlic and turmeric will probably take about 5 – 10 minutes to fry. You want to make sure it turns dark golden in color, and you’ll be able to feel the crispiness with your spatula.
When the garlic and turmeric is done, strain it all out, and let it drain for a few minutes.
Take your fried fish, put it on a plate, and then pile on all the fried garlic and turmeric.",en,{},4.0,,"Thai Street Food, Restaurants, and Recipes | Eating Thai Food",40,Feeds about 2 – 3

When the oil is hot and sizzling, drop in the egg. Let it sizzle and bubble up, and at the same time, splash some of the hot oil onto the top of the egg (don’t flip the egg, unless you really want to).
After the egg looks about right to your cooked likeness (I like mine runny), take it out, drain the excess oil, and put it on a plate for later.
Cut the chicken into small bite sized pieces.
Rinse and peel the garlic and chilies, and pound them in a mortar and pestle (alternatively you can just mince them with a knife). They don’t need to be super fine, you just want to bring out the oils and flavors from the garlic and chilies.
Pluck a good sized handful of holy basil leaves off the stems.
Now it’s time to start cooking. Heat your wok on high heat, and add about 1 tablespoon of oil to the pan.
When the oil is hot, add the chilies and garlic. Stir fry them for about 20 seconds or so until they get really fragrant, but don’t let them burn or get too dry.
Toss in your chicken. Keep stir frying continuously. At this stage you want to continue to stir and cook your chicken until it’s just about fully cooked all the way through (depending on the size pieces of chicken and how hot your fire is, it should take about 2 – 3 minutes). If it starts to get dry, add just a tiny splash of water.
Add 1 teaspoon of oyster sauce, ½ teaspoon light soy sauce, ½ teaspoon sugar, and finally a splash of dark soy sauce. Keep stir frying for about another 30 seconds.
Grab a handful of holy basil, toss it into the pan, fold it into the chicken, and then immediately turn off the heat (if you’re using an electric stove, you’ll want to remove the pan from the burner). The holy basil really only needs to cook for about 5 seconds, and it will continue to wilt and cook from the existing heat of the chicken. This step is important because if you cook the basil for too long, it loses some of its glorious flavor and gets slightly chewy.",en,{},4.9,,"Thai Street Food, Restaurants, and Recipes | Eating Thai Food",20,1 serving(s)
Authentic Tom Yum Recipe (ต้มยำกุ้ง) with Shrimp,Mark Wiens (EatingThaiFood.com),https://www.eatingthaifood.com/tom-yum-soup-recipe/,Thai,https://migrationology.smugmug.com/Eating-Thai-Food/i-DhvBn9k/0/X2/thai-tom-yum-recipe-11-X2.jpg,"['2 liters of water', '4 stalks of lemongrass', '1 inch chunk of galangal', '10 kaffir lime leaves', '10 Thai chilies', '5 cloves of garlic', '½ kilo shrimp', '300 grams of oyster mushrooms', '2 roma tomatoes', '2 white onions (medium sized)', '2 teaspoons of sugar', '8 - 12 tablespoons of fish sauce (depending on your taste)', '8 - 12 tablespoons of lime juice (10 - 15 limes)', 'Handful of cilantro', '3 tablespoons canned Thai roasted chili sauce (nam prik pao น้ำพริกเผา)', '10 tablespoons evaporated milk', 'Taste test, you may need to add more lime juice or fish sauce as the milk and roasted chili sauce throws off the sourness and saltiness.']","First thing to do is put about 2 liters of water in a pot to boil.
Then I like to start by squeezing my limes. This is not the first step of the recipe, but it’s best to have your limes squeezed so when you need them later, you don’t need to rush to squeeze them all. Slice about 10 limes and juice them all into a small bowl, and set them aside for later.
Take your stalks of lemongrass, and first tear off the outermost leaf and throw it out. Then, I like to use a mallet to lightly pound the lemongrass to release the flavors. Then just slice it diagonally into 1 inch strips or so.
Take about 1 thumb sized chunk of the root part of galangal, and chop it into slices.
Coarsely break about 10 kaffir lime leaves - no need to cut them, just tear them - which is going to help release their flavor.
Peel about 5 cloves of garlic.
I used about 10 Thai bird chilies (prik kee noo) for this recipe, but you can use however many you’d like. First, take off the stem, and then you can either just slice them in two pieces, or give them a little pound on your cutting board like I did (just be careful of flying seeds). You can also remove the seeds if you’d still like the chili flavor but not as much heat.
Throw the lemongrass, galangal, kaffir lime leaves, garlic and chilies into the water. You can put on the lid just so it starts to boil and release all the herb flavors quicker.
Now prepare your shrimp (or whatever meat of choice you’re making tom yum with). Since I used goong mae nam (กุ้งแม่น้ำ), freshwater shrimp, I first chopped off all the tentacles.
Boil your soup with all the herbs in it for about 10 minutes, and you can go ahead and toss in the shrimp and turn the fire to low.
Then add your mushrooms, which you should pre rinse beforehand.
Take two roma tomatoes and two small white onions and slice them into wedges - you want them to be big and chunky. Then go ahead and add them to the tom yum.
If you’re using shrimp for this tom yum recipe, you might get some foam build up on top of your soup, in which case you can just lightly skim it off the top and toss it out.
Boil the tom yum for about 2 - 3 minutes.
Next, add about 6 tablespoons of fish sauce first, and 2 teaspoons of sugar. You may need more of each, but start with that.
Boil your tom yum for another minute or so and then turn off the heat. You don’t want your tom yum to be overcooked. The mushrooms and onions should be soft, and then it’s ready.
Once your heat is off, go back to your lime juice and add about 8 tablespoons of lime juice (depending on how sour you like it, I like it really sour).
Make sure you taste test until your tom yum is perfectly sour and salty. You might need to add more fish sauce, sugar, or lime juice.
Finally chop up a handful of fresh cilantro, throw it in the soup, and give your tom yum a final stir. The lime juice and cilantro taste fresher and more vibrant when not boiled, so that’s why I turn off the heat before adding them.
You now have Tom yum goong nam sai (ต้มยำกุ้งน้ำใส), the clear version of tom yum.
For this recipe, I took out about ½ of the tom yum and set it aside as the clear version, and then made the other ½ as the creamy version.
Turn your heat back on low.
Add about 3 heaping tablespoons of Thai roasted chili sauce (nam prik pao น้ำพริกเผา) to your soup and stir it in.
Also about 10 tablespoons of evaporated milk.
Mix it all in and let your soup heat up for about 1 minute.
At this stage, you’ll need to taste test and evaluate. The roasted chili sauce and creaminess from the evaporated milk will alter the flavors from the clear version, so you might need more lime juice and more fish sauce. Just keep taste testing until it’s exactly how you like it.
And there you have the creamy version of tom yum.",en,{},4.8,,"Thai Street Food, Restaurants, and Recipes | Eating Thai Food",30,3 - 5

No need to wait until your oil is hot, just toss in about 3 tablespoons of red curry paste into the oil and start stir frying it in the oil. Let it sizzle for about 20 – 30 seconds on low heat, and it should really be fragrant (you might even cough from the frying chilies!).
Next add your chicken, turn up the heat to high, and start stir frying constantly, fully mixing the chicken with the curry sauce.
Quickly season with 1 teaspoon of fish sauce (give your curry paste a test to see how salty it already is, from the package it might be saltier than the homemade version), and ½ teaspoon sugar.

Prepare the shrimp by taking off the head and peeling the shell, and then devein them. If you want to prepare your shrimp Thai style, peel the body, but leave the tail on.
Stink beans grow in a long twisted hard pods, so the first thing to do is peel the stink beans out of the outer shell. The skin is quite tough so it’s easiest to take a sharp knife and slice the bean, almost in half first. Then peel back the skin and remove the stink bean inside. You’ll also see an inner, beige colored skin that coats the stink beans, and you want to remove that too. Go through all the pods and remove all the stink beans – this will probably take a few minutes. If you haven’t watched the video yet, make sure you watch it for a better explanation of how to peel the stink beans. That’s all for the prep work, it’s time to get stir frying.
Put your wok or frying pan on a medium heat and add about 2 tbsp of oil. I normally like to use less oil when I stir fry Thai food, but with this stink bean curry recipe, you really need to add some oil so the curry paste gets nice and fragrant when frying and doesn’t stick to the bottom of the pan.
When your oil is sizzling hot, add in the curry paste, first start with 2 tbsp. – you can always come back and add more later if it’s not flavorful enough. Then add about ½ tsp of shrimp paste.
Stir fry the curry paste, working it into the oil, and scraping it off the bottom of the pan. Immediately you should start to smell those beautiful chilies, the lemongrass and the turmeric. Keep stir frying for about 30 seconds to 1 minute, making sure the paste doesn’t burn, but is nice and fragrant.
Add the shrimp, and stir fry continuously for about 30 seconds. The shrimp should pretty quickly start to turn from transparent to pink orange in color. If the curry paste starts to get dry, you can toss in a splash of water, and that should give you some liquid to work with as well as a little extra sauce.
Then toss in the stink beans, and stir fry for about another 30 seconds or so. You want to keep frying hard so the curry paste doesn’t stick to the pan.
Season with ½ tbsp of oyster sauce and ½ tbsp of sugar (the normal Thai way is to use sugar, so I showed it this way in the recipe, BUT, when I cook it myself I normally omit the sugar or use just a tiny bit – so up to you how much sugar you want to add).
Again, if your goong pad sataw (กุ้งผัดสะตอ) get’s dry, add another splash of water, and then stir fry for just another minute.
The final step is to take 6 – 8 kaffir lime leaves, and tear them off the stems directly into the curry. When you tear the kaffir lime leaves, it will release their flavor. Stir fry for just 10 seconds, and then turn off the heat.

Peel 2 cloves of garlic, and then just finely mince them
Slice ¼ of a sweet white onion into medium sized strips
Finely dice about 3 – 4 green onions
Take just 1 leaf of Chinese broccoli (kai-lan), slice it in half first along the spine, and then slice it into 1 centimeter sized strips

Add in a little less than ½ of your rice first. This is going to soak up all those delicious shrimp juices and oils and keep your rice nice and dry. Stir fry for about 10 more seconds – This is a little known trick to make good rice, so it remains nice and dry
Scoot all your rice to one side of the pan, and then crack in the egg into the empty side
Whirl the egg up, let it cook for a few seconds, and then start to mix it up with the rice and shrimp
Keep stir frying for about 20 seconds until the egg is fully cooked, and then add in the rest of your rice, and give it a quick stir
Add ½ tablespoon of soy sauce, ½ tablespoon of oyster sauce, just a pinch of sugar (optional), and continue stir frying your rice, making sure all the sauce get mixed in
Then add your chopped Chinese broccoli and onions, and stir fry for another 30 seconds until the vegetables wilt, but they can still be crisp and not fully cooked
Lastly, toss in your green onions, stir it a few more seconds, and it’s ready
Immediately dish your fried rice onto a plate
Slice off a wedge of lime, and serve it on the plate next to the rice
For the final touch, I like to sprinkle some freshly ground black pepper on top to give some extra flavor
Add 3 tablespoons of fish sauce to a small bowl
Slice about 5 Thai chilies (you can add more or less, up to you), and add them to the fish sauce

I like the traditional method as you get bigger, un-even, pieces of green papaya. Cut enough green papaya to have a big handful worth for this recipe.
Add 2 cloves of peeled garlic and 5 chillies (or however many you like) to the mortar (krok). Pound them for a few seconds until the garlic is crushed and chilies are reduced to small bits.

Heat a frying pan on low heat, toss in the uncooked Thai sticky rice (no oil). Stir continuously, kind of like you’re roasting peanuts or coffee. Toast the rice until it turns from white to golden yellow, almost to the point where it looks like brown wheat. It will also be very fragrant and smell almost like popcorn. It took me about 15 minutes or so.
Once the rice is finished toasting, and has cooled off a bit, put it into your stone mortar and pestle. Pound the rice until it turns into a coarse powder (a blender or food processor will also work fine). Put your toasted sticky rice powder in a bowl aside.
Add 300 grams of minced pork to a small sized saucepan with a handle. Fry the pork, breaking it into small minced pieces, until it’s fully cooked all the way through.

Leaving the pork in the same pot, add 1 heaping tablespoon of the toasted rice powder into the pork. Also toss in ½ – 1 tablespoon of chili flakes.
Add a pinch of sugar, ½ tablespoon of fish sauce, and squeeze in the juice from 1 – 2 limes (I used about 1 ½ full limes, but I like it quite sour).
Give the pork and the seasoning a quick stir.
Peel and slice the shallots, finely mince about 5 green onions and a few culantro leaves (if you have them), and just pluck about 20 or so mint leaves off the stem. Throw everything into the saucepan with the pork.
Give the larb moo a good mix, making sure all the spices and dressing coats the pork.

Peel the garlic and shallots, and slice off the skin of the kaffir lime. Cut all the chili paste ingredients into small pieces, to make them easier to grind in a stone mortar and pestle.
In a stone mortar, first add ½ tsp of salt, then begin pounding the Thai dry chilies until you have chili flakes. Then add the fresh chilies, and keep on pounding. Next add the rest of the ingredients and keep pounding for about 15 minutes. You don’t need it to be smooth like a Thai curry paste, but you’re just looking for a coarse chunky chili paste. You could alternatively use a food processor or blender.
If you use whole fish, like I did, fillet the fish by slicing the meat off both sides. Then cut the fish into medium sized pieces, about ½ the size of a deck of cards.
In a mixing bowl, add the boneless fish (skin still on is best), add the pounded chili paste, and season with salt. Mix thoroughly so all the fish is coated with chili paste.
Tear or cut the banana leaf into 30 – 40 cm (1 foot or a little more) pieces. Prepare about 12 pieces.
Banana leaves have a strong side and a fragile side – keep this in mind. Take two of the banana leaf pieces, with the white dull side up (green shiny side down), and give the leaves a quick wipe with a wet cloth. Place one leaf down, then layer another on top of it, but turn it 180 degrees. So there should be a strong edge on one side, and a fragile edge on one side, but two leaves opposite of each other – one strong and one fragile side together.
Place a handful of fresh lemon basil and Thai sweet basil in the center of the leaf, then top with a couple pieces of fish and chili paste. Then tear a couple of kaffir lime leaves, and add them to the top of the fish.

Add 3 teaspoons of white pepper corns to your mortar and pound it until it’s a fine powder.
Add ½ teaspoon of cumin and ½ teaspoon of coriander to the pepper and mix it all thoroughly, and then set them aside in a small bowl.
Take 8 dry spur chilies (prik chee fa haeng), soak them in water for a few minutes to rehydrate them, then drain the chilies. Cut off their stems, and you can then chop them into small centimeter pieces. Some people take out the seeds to make their red curry paste less spicy, but in my opinion you’ve got to keep the seeds.
Add the chopped dry chilies to the mortar along with ½ teaspoon of salt and start pounding. Keep on pounding for about 5 – 10 minutes until most of the chilies are nice and broken, the oils are coming out, and it’s starting to looks almost tomatoey.
Step back over to your chopping board and peel about 10 – 14 cloves of garlic. I used a type of Thai garlic, which is small and extra pungent variety, but using regular garlic will work fine too. If the cloves are really big, use about 8.
Next peel 5 small shallots (Thai shallots are really small, about the size of a grape), so if you have big shallots you might need just 2 or 3. Chop them into small pieces.
Take 1 stalk of lemongrass, pull off and discard the outermost leaf, and then slice it from the bottom into small slivers. You want enough for 1 tablespoon.
Take the fresh coriander roots from about 3 stalks, cut off the roots, slice them into small pieces, and again you want about 1 tablespoon worth of coriander roots.
Take your galangal, and if you can find baby galangal that’s not too old, it will be softer, but whatever you have is alright. Again, slice it into pieces and you want enough for 1 tablespoon worth.
Next take a fresh kaffir lime and slice off only the green skin. You want to slice off the skin very delicately, making sure you get mostly green, not cutting off any of the white pith. I used the skin from about ½ of the kaffir lime.
Toss all of those ingredients into the already pounded chilies.
Pound and pound and pound until you’ve got a buttery, oily, and extremely fragrant Thai red curry paste. This should take anywhere from 15 – 30 minutes, and yes it’s tough work, but it’s so worth it (again, you can alternatively use a blender or food processor).
When your paste is buttery and smooth, go back to your bowl of white pepper and dry spices, and mix it into the paste. You don’t need to pound hard now, just mix it all in and smooth it out.
Final step is to add in just ½ teaspoon of shrimp paste. Pound your paste altogether and make sure the shrimp paste is fully mixed in.",en,{},4.9,,"Thai Street Food, Restaurants, and Recipes | Eating Thai Food",45,About 8 – 10 tablespoons of paste
Khua Kling Recipe,Mark Wiens,https://www.eatingthaifood.com/thai-khua-kling-recipe/,Southern Thai Cuisine,http://migrationology.smugmug.com/Thai-Recipes/i-JDn6Pjw/0/X2/kua-kling-recipe-23-X2.jpg,"['500 g. minced pork, beef, or chicken (I used minced meat, but small slices of meat are common too)', '3 tbsp. southern Thai curry paste (you can see the recipe here)', '50 g. lemongrass (this was 2 stalks when I made this recipe)', '1 red spur chili (this is not completely necessary, but if you add one, it will make your curry look really nice)', '10 – 15 kaffir lime leaves (I probably used about ¾ of them while cooking, and used the other ¼ to sprinkle on top at the end)', 'pinch of sugar (depending on how much you like and how much you want to )', 'Thai bird chilies (I like to slice up some red Thai bird chilies to sprinkle on top of my plate, just for the final spicy touch and for extra red color)']","The first step is to take your lemongrass, slice off the bottoms of the stalks, tear off two or three of the tough outer layers, and then finely shave it. The finer you shave the lemongrass, the more flavor it will add, and the the easier it will be to chew.
To prepare the kaffir lime leaves, you want to grab about five or six leaves, which come as a pair, then I like to fold them over, so you’ve got a nice layered sandwich of kaffir lime leaves. Slice off any of the big stems if there are any, and then finely slice them into thin strips.
I included the spur chili in this recipe mostly to give the khua kling (คั่วกลิ้ง) a beautiful red accent color, but it’s not what gives the dish its spice – that comes from the curry paste. For the spur chili, just cut off the stem, slice the chili in half, and then slice it into thin diagonal strips. Set all those ingredients aside, and we’ll come back to them later.
Turn on your stove to a medium high heat, heat up your wok or pan for a few seconds, and then add about 3 tbsp. of southern Thai curry paste (it may be kind of dry, but since this is a dry curry, you don’t want to add any oil).
One of the tricks my wife taught me, so the curry paste doesn’t burn, is to quickly add in just 1 spoon of meat into the curry paste and start to stir fry it. This will give the curry paste a little extra moisture, but it will still get that direct heat that you want, so the curry paste reaches its maximum flavor potential.
Fry the curry paste for 2 – 3 minutes, and then add in the rest of the meat. Your pan should be quite hot, and due to the dryness, it might start to stick to the bottom. So you want to really work the wok hard by scraping and getting all that good flavor off the bottom of the pan.
Stir fry the meat until it’s broken into small minced pieces, and almost all the way cooked through, then toss in just a pinch of sugar, depending on how much you like (I used about ½ teaspoon, but I know some Thai cooks would use a whole spoon in their recipe).
Give it a quick stir, then add the lemongrass.
Quickly stir it, then toss in about ¾ of your shaved kaffir lime leaves. Stir fry for about 1 minute.
Just a few seconds before turning off your heat, add the sliced red spur chili, stir fry for a few more seconds, and turn off your heat, but keep frying for another minute or so.
Grab a bowl, and dish out your khua kling (คั่วกลิ้ง).
The final step is to take the remaining portion of your finely shaved kaffir lime leaves (of you can slice more if you used them all), along with a handful of sliced Thai bird chilies, and sprinkle them on top of your plate of khua kling (คั่วกลิ้ง).",en,{},4.8,,"Thai Street Food, Restaurants, and Recipes | Eating Thai Food",20,1 plate

You should immediately start to smell the aroma of the shrimp paste. Allow the shrimp paste to just sizzle for about a minute on either side, then remove from the grill. This step is optional, but it increases the fragrance of the shrimp paste. Set aside.
Peel the shallots and garlic, and rip off the stems of the Thai bird’s eye chilies.
In a mortar and pestle, pound the garlic, shallots, and chilies for about 10 minutes until you get a nice semi-smooth oily paste.
Add about 10 pea eggplant to the mortar, and gently crush them, just to release the seeds.
Then add the shrimp paste and palm sugar to the mortar, and pound and mix simultaneously for about a minute until the mixture is even.
Then add about 3 tbsp of lime juice to start and mix everything together, still in the mortar, with a spoon.
Now to taste test. The nam prik kapi (น้ำพริกกะปิ) should be like a sauce in texture, and should be salty, sour, and spicy, with only a faint hint of sweetness. Add more lime juice or chilies as needed to balance the taste.
Once finished, garnish with whole Thai bird’s eye chilies and more pea eggplant.
For the vegetables, either serve them raw, or blanch in hot water for 1 – 2 minutes.",en,{},5.0,,"Thai Street Food, Restaurants, and Recipes | Eating Thai Food",25,1 bowl of sauce

Bring a pot of water to boil, then boil the fish for about 5 – 10 minutes until fully cooked.
Remove the fish from the water, drain fully, and leave to cool.
Once the fish is cool, carefully take off the skin and debone all the meat from the fish, and flake the fish in your fingers so it’s almost like deboned minced fish. Discard the bones and skin.
Set aside the fish for later.
Cut off the ends of the lemongrass and tear off the outer few layers, then shave the lemongrass into small pieces. Cut the turmeric into small pieces as well.
In a mortar and pestle (or alternatively a food processor), start with a pinch of salt, then pound the dry chilies first for about 10 minutes.
Then add the lemongrass, turmeric, garlic, and peppercorns, and pound for about 30 minutes until a relatively smooth paste.
Once the paste is pretty smooth, the final step is to add the shrimp paste, and pound and mix for another 5 minutes.
Set aside.
In a large pot or sauce pan, add all the coconut milk and curry paste, then turn on medium heat.
Stir gently, and only in one direction, making sure all the curry paste dissolves into the coconut milk.
Add the minced fish, season with salt, and tear the kaffir lime leaves in half and add them to the curry.
Keep stirring in one direction, and once it comes to a boil, turn down the heat. You don’t want the curry to boil strongly. Keep stirring gently for about 5 minutes once it comes to a boil.

If your chicken hasn’t been de-gutted, you’ll need to first carefully remove the entire organ system. You have to cut a slit in the back of the chicken, about 6 cm in length, and then reach in with your hand to remove all the organs. Be careful not to break the intestines or innards as it can cause the chicken to get bitter.
Once your chicken is de-gutted, stuff the feet of the chicken into the body cavity, and then twist the wings to the top of the chicken – this is just going to keep its limbs from flapping while being boiled.
Put enough water into a pot to cover your chicken, and then bring it to a boil (chickens not in yet). Once your water is boiling, reduce the heat to low.
Add the salt into the water and dissolve it.
Add the chickens to the boiling water and boil them for about 35 – 45 minutes, if you’re only doing one chicken it might only take 30 – 40 minutes – so just keep an eye on it. If you have a meat thermometer, that could come in handy.
Once the chicken is firm and bouncy, you can remove the chicken from the pot, and lay it in a pan to cool.
That’s it for the boiled chicken.
For a proper Thai street food version of khao man gai (ข้าวมันไก่), you need to have some chicken oil. I made some by taking extra chicken skin, putting it into a hot wok for about 10 minutes and sizzling all the oil out of it – we probably had about 1.5 cups of chicken oil. However, if you don’t want to use chicken oil, you can also just use any kind of vegetable oil.
Take the garlic, and blend it up, or use a food processor. Alternatively, you can just mince it up as well. In Thailand they just use the full cloves of garlic, without even taking off the skin.
Then take the minced garlic and deep fry it in either the chicken oil or vegetable oil. You want to fry it on a medium low heat, and stir it continually in the oil so the garlic doesn’t stick. You want the garlic to become nice and golden brown, without burning or getting too dark. It should take about 5 – 8 minutes.
Once your garlic has been fried, strain and drain it.
Add your uncooked rice to a rice cooker pot, and first give it a good rinse and drain.
Add the fried garlic to the uncooked rice, along with the chicken broth (from cooking the chicken), and a bit of salt to taste.
Stir the uncooked rice and broth all around, even it out in the pot, and finally press cook on your rice cooker. Let the rice cooker work its magic.
When the rice finishes cooking, let it sit for a few minutes, and then open the cover and just fluff it up.
Cut up your winter melon or daikon radish into about 5 cm pieces. For the winter melon, I first sliced off the skin, then cut it into quarters, removed the seeds, and sliced it into pieces.
Go over to your chicken broth, and try to skim off the top layer of oil, and discard.
Now bring your chicken broth to a boil, and then add in the pieces of winter melon or radish.
While your soup is boiling, you can go ahead and add in as much salt and pepper to your tasting. It shouldn’t be too salty or too peppery, you’re looking for just a soothing broth.
Boil your soup for about 15 minutes or so, until the winter melon or daikon radish is soft.
Final step for the soup is to turn off the heat, take a handful of cilantro, chop it up, and toss it in. Give that a quick stir, and it’s ready.
For the sauce, just chop up the ginger, and then just throw it, with all of the ingredients into a blender or food processor.
You don’t need to blend it up completely, it can be a little chunky (depending on your preference).
Transfer your blended sauce over to a pot or wok, and you want to just bring it to a boil for a few seconds – this is not really for any reason other than to kill any bacteria and make your sauce last longer (this sauce should last in the fridge for about 3 – 4 days, but of course it probably tastes the best when it’s freshest).
Pour the sauce into a bowl and it’s ready to be eaten.",en,{},4.8,,"Thai Street Food, Restaurants, and Recipes | Eating Thai Food",210,4 serving(s)
