Combine
In a large bowl, place the chopped chicken and add rice wine, onion powder, garlic powder, salt, ginger powder, and ground black pepper. Combine them well. Set aside.
Dredge
Place the corn starch in a large bowl. Dredge the seasoned chicken pieces in the corn starch and evenly coat them.
Deep Fry
In a deep saucepan (or fryer) add a generous amount of oil and heat it until the oil temperature reaches 175 C / 347 F. Start adding the chicken carefully and fry them until they cook. (It takes 4 to 5 mins depending on the size of chicken). Do not overcrowd the pan, and cook in batches if needed. (It might be useful to use a grease splatter screen if you have one as it minimises oil splatter.)
Twice Deep Fry
Take out the cooked chicken and place them onto some kitchen paper to soak up excess oil. Quickly scoop out any floating debris from the oil using a skimmer. Deep fry the chicken again when the oil temperature reaches 175 C / 347 F. Fry them until the batter is golden and crisp. (The second time frying is shorter than the first time, 2 to 3 mins.) Set aside.
Make Sauce
In a separate pan, combine all the sauce ingredients. Bring it to boil over medium low heat while stirring often. Once the sauce starts bubbling, take out the chilies and green onion pieces. In a separate bowl, combine and mix the slurry ingredients then pour it over the sauce. Stir often. Once the sauce thickens or turns to glaze (within 1 – 2 mins), remove from the heat and cool down for 5 mins.
Baste
Place the double fried chicken onto the lined baking sheet, then using a cooking brush, gently baste the chicken with the sauce. Once all the chicken is coated with the sauce, garnish with sesame seeds and green onions. Serve.
Air Fryer Method (Frying Only)
Spray cooking oil on air fryer basket.
Line Up
Place the chicken pieces, without overlapping, onto the basket. Spray some oil lightly over the chicken pieces. (While it is optional, chicken browns better with extra oil coating.)
Air Fry
Cook at 200 C / 390 F for 6 to 7 mins. Turn them over and spray oil lightly to cover the dried white spots (from corn starch). Cook for another 6 to 7 mins, or until golden brown.",en-US,"{'calories': '549 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '63 g', 'proteinContent': '46 g', 'fatContent': '9 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '2 g', 'cholesterolContent': '214 mg', 'sodiumContent': '1601 mg', 'fiberContent': '1 g', 'sugarContent': '15 g', 'servingSize': '1 serving'}",5.0,,My Korean Kitchen,40,4 serving(s)

(A pot with a long handle is a great option as you can filter the oil easier later on.)
Add in the garlic, ginger, green onion into a wide base saucepan or sauté pan. Pour the cooking oil and bring it to boil over medium high heat until the aromatics start turning light brown or until the oil temperature reaches about 170 C / 340 F when you use an instant thermometer. Depending on your stove type, it will be between 5 to 10 mins to reach this point. Another sign you could use is by splashing a small amount (about 2 tsp) of boiled oil over the Korean chili flakes. If the temperature is high enough, the chili flakes will make some sizzling bubbles. Turn the heat off.
Scoop out the aromatic vegetables using a slotted spoon or tongs and discard. Or strain them while pouring the oil over the chili flakes (from step 1) in a few batches. It will make small sizzling bubbles initially then die down as it cools. Stir around the chili flakes and oil to mix them well. Steep the chili flakes for 15 mins and allow it to bring out the flavor and color.
Filter the oil using a funnel and filter paper and transfer the chili oil into a sterilized glass jar. (Most Koreans do not keep the residual chili flakes after steeping but if you want to you can keep them. Just skip the filtering process.) To store, refrigerate the jar. Try to use the oil within 2 months. To use, give the oil a stir before using and always use a clean spoon to scoop it out.",en-US,"{'calories': '3418 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '84 g', 'proteinContent': '20 g', 'fatContent': '354 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '28 g', 'sodiumContent': '1963 mg', 'fiberContent': '45 g', 'sugarContent': '11 g', 'servingSize': '1 serving'}",5.0,,My Korean Kitchen,30,1 serving(s)

Combine the sauce ingredients – ketchup, soy sauce, Tonkatsu sauce, honey, water and milk in a bowl or large measuring cup. Set aside.
Preheat a frying pan and add the cooking oil and flour. Cook over medium to medium high heat until the liquid turns dark brown. It takes about 5 to 7 minutes. Stir occasionally. Reduce the heat to low.
Pour the sauce in from step 1 and stir well. Bring up the heat and cook over medium low to medium heat until the sauce thickens (about 8-10 minutes). Stir often. Set aside.
FRIED RICE
Preheat a skillet and add some cooking oil. Stir fry carrot, onion, green bell pepper and smoked ham until all ingredients are cooked.
Add the rice and the rice seasoning and mix them well for 1 to 2 minutes.
Turn the heat off. Cover with foil or a lid to keep the rice warm while getting other ingredients ready.
When ready to serve, shape the rice in a small bowl to make mounds of rice. Place the serving plate on the bowl and flip. Remove the bowl.
TORNADO OMELETTE
Beat the eggs in a bowl. To give a smooth texture, sieve through the eggs. (This is also one of the key points for success as it makes the omelette turn smoothly). Add a pinch of salt.
Preheat a non-stick frying pan over medium high heat. (It should be heated well enough for the egg to bubble up when you pour it in.) Add some cooking oil and spread it all over the pan.
Pour the beaten egg onto the pan and cook it until the edge (about 3 mm / 0.12 inch) is cooked. But an easier telltale is when the omelette starts forming air bubbles in the middle of the pan. You should look for a bit larger sized bubbles.
Hold one wooden chopstick in each hand diagonally to yourself and push the egg from the edge towards the centre while maintaining about 4 to 5 cm (1.5-2 inch) gap between each chopstick, and start twirling your chopsticks in one direction. Holding diagonal instead of parallel to yourself will give you more room to turn the egg. Swap the chopstick holding hands in between twirling to be able to keep turning and to make the tornado egg smoothly. Cook the omelette until it’s about 95% cooked. (If the omelette is fully cooked, it’s hard to keep the tornado shape as it might break in the centre.)
Hold the chopsticks with one hand and slowly slide the omelette from the pan onto the shaped rice.
Pour the demi-glace sauce (or ketchup if you didn’t make the sauce) and serve.
OVAL SHAPE OMELETTE
Beat the eggs in a bowl. To give a smooth texture, sieve through the eggs. Add a pinch of salt.
Preheat a non-stick frying pan over medium high heat. Add some cooking oil.
Reduce the heat to medium and pour the beaten egg in the pan. Quickly spread the egg and make a thin, large, and round omelette.
Once the omelette is 85% cooked, place one serving of fried rice in the middle of the omelette and spread well.
Fold around the edge of the omelette toward the rice, providing a short blanket.
Slowly slide and flip the egg from the pan onto the serving plate. Or place the serving plate on the omelette rice and flip the pan. Ensure there’s no residual oil in the pan to avoid an accidental burn.
Use cooking foil (or cooking paper) to shape the omelette into an oval shape. Watch out as the omelette rice can be hot.
Pour the demi-glace sauce (or ketchup if you didn’t make the sauce) and serve.
ROUND SHAPE OMELETTE (EASIEST)
Beat the eggs in a bowl. To give a smooth texture, sieve through the eggs. Add a pinch of salt.
Preheat a non-stick frying pan over medium high heat. Add some cooking oil.
Pour the beaten egg in the pan. Quickly spread the egg and make a thin, large, and round omelette.
Once the omelette is fully cooked, slide it out onto a small bowl. Gently tuck in the egg following the shape of the bowl.
Place the fried rice on top of the omelette (from step 4). Push it gently to shape it firm.
Place the serving plate on top of the bowl. Flip the plate and remove the bowl.

Blend the sauce ingredients in a mixer or food processor until smooth. Pour over the meat. Add the baby potatoes and carrots. Close the lid and cook for 8 hours on low heat. (You could cook for 5 hours on high heat if you’re short on time, but I find that it results in less flavorful and less tender meat.)
30 mins prior to the end of the cooking time, make the starch slurry by combining the water with the starch flour. Whisk well and pour it into the slow cooker.

Then simmer the sauce over the stove on high heat, stirring, until it thickens. You may use the starch slurry to quicken the process.
