Combine
In a large bowl, place the chopped chicken and add rice wine, onion powder, garlic powder, salt, ginger powder, and ground black pepper. Combine them well. Set aside.
Dredge
Place the corn starch in a large bowl. Dredge the seasoned chicken pieces in the corn starch and evenly coat them.
Deep Fry
In a deep saucepan (or fryer) add a generous amount of oil and heat it until the oil temperature reaches 175 C / 347 F. Start adding the chicken carefully and fry them until they cook. (It takes 4 to 5 mins depending on the size of chicken). Do not overcrowd the pan, and cook in batches if needed. (It might be useful to use a grease splatter screen if you have one as it minimises oil splatter.)
Twice Deep Fry
Take out the cooked chicken and place them onto some kitchen paper to soak up excess oil. Quickly scoop out any floating debris from the oil using a skimmer. Deep fry the chicken again when the oil temperature reaches 175 C / 347 F. Fry them until the batter is golden and crisp. (The second time frying is shorter than the first time, 2 to 3 mins.) Set aside.
Make Sauce
In a separate pan, combine all the sauce ingredients. Bring it to boil over medium low heat while stirring often. Once the sauce starts bubbling, take out the chilies and green onion pieces. In a separate bowl, combine and mix the slurry ingredients then pour it over the sauce. Stir often. Once the sauce thickens or turns to glaze (within 1 – 2 mins), remove from the heat and cool down for 5 mins.
Baste
Place the double fried chicken onto the lined baking sheet, then using a cooking brush, gently baste the chicken with the sauce. Once all the chicken is coated with the sauce, garnish with sesame seeds and green onions. Serve.
Air Fryer Method (Frying Only)
Spray cooking oil on air fryer basket.
Line Up
Place the chicken pieces, without overlapping, onto the basket. Spray some oil lightly over the chicken pieces. (While it is optional, chicken browns better with extra oil coating.)
Air Fry
Cook at 200 C / 390 F for 6 to 7 mins. Turn them over and spray oil lightly to cover the dried white spots (from corn starch). Cook for another 6 to 7 mins, or until golden brown.",en-US,5.0,,My Korean Kitchen,40,4 serving(s),549 kcal,63 g,46 g,9 g,2 g,214 mg,1601 mg,15 g,1 serving,1 g

(A pot with a long handle is a great option as you can filter the oil easier later on.)
Add in the garlic, ginger, green onion into a wide base saucepan or sauté pan. Pour the cooking oil and bring it to boil over medium high heat until the aromatics start turning light brown or until the oil temperature reaches about 170 C / 340 F when you use an instant thermometer. Depending on your stove type, it will be between 5 to 10 mins to reach this point. Another sign you could use is by splashing a small amount (about 2 tsp) of boiled oil over the Korean chili flakes. If the temperature is high enough, the chili flakes will make some sizzling bubbles. Turn the heat off.
Scoop out the aromatic vegetables using a slotted spoon or tongs and discard. Or strain them while pouring the oil over the chili flakes (from step 1) in a few batches. It will make small sizzling bubbles initially then die down as it cools. Stir around the chili flakes and oil to mix them well. Steep the chili flakes for 15 mins and allow it to bring out the flavor and color.
Filter the oil using a funnel and filter paper and transfer the chili oil into a sterilized glass jar. (Most Koreans do not keep the residual chili flakes after steeping but if you want to you can keep them. Just skip the filtering process.) To store, refrigerate the jar. Try to use the oil within 2 months.

Combine the sauce ingredients – ketchup, soy sauce, Tonkatsu sauce, honey, water and milk in a bowl or large measuring cup. Set aside.
Preheat a frying pan and add the cooking oil and flour. Cook over medium to medium high heat until the liquid turns dark brown. It takes about 5 to 7 minutes. Stir occasionally. Reduce the heat to low.
Pour the sauce in from step 1 and stir well. Bring up the heat and cook over medium low to medium heat until the sauce thickens (about 8-10 minutes). Stir often. Set aside.
FRIED RICE
Preheat a skillet and add some cooking oil. Stir fry carrot, onion, green bell pepper and smoked ham until all ingredients are cooked.
Add the rice and the rice seasoning and mix them well for 1 to 2 minutes.
Turn the heat off. Cover with foil or a lid to keep the rice warm while getting other ingredients ready.
When ready to serve, shape the rice in a small bowl to make mounds of rice. Place the serving plate on the bowl and flip. Remove the bowl.
TORNADO OMELETTE
Beat the eggs in a bowl. To give a smooth texture, sieve through the eggs. (This is also one of the key points for success as it makes the omelette turn smoothly). Add a pinch of salt.
Preheat a non-stick frying pan over medium high heat. (It should be heated well enough for the egg to bubble up when you pour it in.) Add some cooking oil and spread it all over the pan.
Pour the beaten egg onto the pan and cook it until the edge (about 3 mm / 0.12 inch) is cooked. But an easier telltale is when the omelette starts forming air bubbles in the middle of the pan. You should look for a bit larger sized bubbles.
Hold one wooden chopstick in each hand diagonally to yourself and push the egg from the edge towards the centre while maintaining about 4 to 5 cm (1.5-2 inch) gap between each chopstick, and start twirling your chopsticks in one direction. Holding diagonal instead of parallel to yourself will give you more room to turn the egg. Swap the chopstick holding hands in between twirling to be able to keep turning and to make the tornado egg smoothly. Cook the omelette until it’s about 95% cooked. (If the omelette is fully cooked, it’s hard to keep the tornado shape as it might break in the centre.)
Hold the chopsticks with one hand and slowly slide the omelette from the pan onto the shaped rice.
Pour the demi-glace sauce (or ketchup if you didn’t make the sauce) and serve.
OVAL SHAPE OMELETTE
Beat the eggs in a bowl. To give a smooth texture, sieve through the eggs. Add a pinch of salt.
Preheat a non-stick frying pan over medium high heat. Add some cooking oil.
Reduce the heat to medium and pour the beaten egg in the pan. Quickly spread the egg and make a thin, large, and round omelette.
Once the omelette is 85% cooked, place one serving of fried rice in the middle of the omelette and spread well.
Fold around the edge of the omelette toward the rice, providing a short blanket.
Slowly slide and flip the egg from the pan onto the serving plate. Or place the serving plate on the omelette rice and flip the pan. Ensure there’s no residual oil in the pan to avoid an accidental burn.
Use cooking foil (or cooking paper) to shape the omelette into an oval shape. Watch out as the omelette rice can be hot.
Pour the demi-glace sauce (or ketchup if you didn’t make the sauce) and serve.
ROUND SHAPE OMELETTE (EASIEST)
Beat the eggs in a bowl. To give a smooth texture, sieve through the eggs. Add a pinch of salt.
Preheat a non-stick frying pan over medium high heat. Add some cooking oil.
Pour the beaten egg in the pan. Quickly spread the egg and make a thin, large, and round omelette.
Once the omelette is fully cooked, slide it out onto a small bowl. Gently tuck in the egg following the shape of the bowl.
Place the fried rice on top of the omelette (from step 4). Push it gently to shape it firm.
Place the serving plate on top of the bowl. Flip the plate and remove the bowl.

Wash the rice in a large bowl. Rice absorbs water very quickly when you start washing, so don't let the rice absorb the opaque water. Gently wash the rice in a circular motion and discard the water. Repeat this process about 3-4 times.
Let the rice soak in water for 30-60 minutes. This helps the rice absorb the seasonings later on and become more tender and moist after cooking. Transfer the rice into a sieve and drain completely for at least 15 minutes. Place the washed and drained rice in the rice cooker.
Meanwhile, prepare the other ingredients. Soak 3 dried shiitake mushrooms in a ½ cup of water for 15 minutes. I place a smaller bowl on top to keep the mushrooms submerged in the water at all times.
In a small saucepan, bring 2 cups of water to boil. Put ⅓ konnyaku and cook for 1 minute to get rid of the smell. Transfer the konnyaku to a plate to cool. Add the aburaage to the same pot of water and cook for 1 minute. This removes excess oil from the aburaage. Transfer aburaage to a plate to cool. Discard the water.
Shave off the gobo skin with the back of the knife. Don’t peel the gobo with a peeler to keep the earthy flavor and fragrance. Then make a “cross” slit on tip of the gobo as you see in the picture below.
Make a lengthwise cross-shape incision about 1 ½ inch (3.8 cm) deep at one end. Shave from that end as if you were sharpening a pencil with a knife while constantly rotating with the other hand. Soak in the water to prevent it from changing color.
Cut the carrot in half lengthwise and cut diagonally into thin slices. Then cut the slices into julienned or smaller pieces.
Cut the aburaage and konnyaku into thin small strips.
Cut the chicken thigh into ¾ inch (2 cm) slanted pieces. Hold your knife at 45-degree angle and slice the chicken. This “sogigiri” cutting technique gives the chicken more surface area so it will cook faster and soak up flavors quickly.
Squeeze the liquid from dried shiitake mushrooms and save the liquid (this is called Shiitake Dashi). Remove the stem and cut the caps into thinly slices.
Strain the Shiitake Dashi into a bowl through a fine mesh strainer to get rid of dirty particles. Set aside. In a measuring cup, add all the shiitake dashi and then pour dashi so you’ll have 1 ½ cup (360 ml) of liquid. Add it to the rice cooker and mix well.
Now your ingredients are ready!
Add 1 ½ Tbsp soy sauce and 1 ½ Tbsp mirin to the rice.
Pour the dashi & shiitake dashi mixture into the rice and mix well.
Add the chicken and evenly distribute over the rice. Do NOT mix the rice with ingredients. The rice won’t be able to absorb enough water to cook and it will end up with a hard texture. Continue from the hard ingredients to softer ingredients. Without mixing all up, start cooking the rice. If you have a “Mixed Rice” option, use it (See Notes below).
Once the rice is done cooking, use a rice paddle to stir the rice and vegetables with light slicing and tossing motions to distribute the ingredients evenly. The bottom of the rice gets slightly caramelized, and this part is called Okoge and it’s especially tasty.
Serve the rice hot or at room temperature. Sprinkle chopped mitsuba or green onion on top.

27,Maple and Miso Glazed Roasted Carrots,Namiko Chen,https://www.justonecookbook.com/maple-and-miso-glazed-roasted-carrots/,American,https://www.justonecookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Maple-and-Miso-Glazed-Roasted-Carrots-0715-I.jpg,"['1 lb carrots ((I used rainbow carrots))', '1 Tbsp extra-virgin olive oil', '¼ tsp kosher/sea salt (I use Diamond Crystal; Use half for table salt)', 'freshly ground black pepper', '1 Tbsp maple syrup', '1 Tbsp miso ((I used reduced salt Enjuku Koji Miso))', '½ tsp soy sauce', 'fresh thyme']","Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat the oven to 425 °F (220 ºC). Gather all the ingredients. If your carrots still have some moisture after washing, be sure to pat them as dry as possible; the drier the vegetable, the better it will roast.
In a small bowl, mix together 1 Tbsp maple syrup, 1 Tbsp miso, and ½ tsp soy sauce.
Peel the carrots (and if they are large, cut uniform slices so that they will roast evenly and be finished at the same time). Place the carrots in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet lined with parchment paper (for easy clean-up). If the carrots are arranged too closely together or are on top of one another, they will steam, making them mushy rather than caramelized. Use a bigger baking sheet or 2 instead.
Drizzle the olive oil and sprinkle salt and pepper. You want each carrot to have a light coating of oil (the oil keeps some moisture in for that interior tenderness). A good rule of thumb is about 2 Tbsp of oil per baking sheet (I'm using a half sheet).
Toss/Roll the carrots with oil and seasoning.
Place in the oven and bake for 20-30 minutes, rotating the baking sheet halfway through to ensure that the carrots are getting equal exposure to the heat and have an equal chance at getting crispy and caramelized. The roasting time may vary depending on the size of the carrots (young thin carrots require less cooking time). When carrots are lightly browned and almost tender when pierced with a wooden skewer, remove the baking sheet from the oven. Why almost tender? We still need to roast for 5 more minutes after brushing the sauce.
Brush the maple and miso mixture over the carrots and flip to coat the other side. Put back in the oven to finish cooking, about 5 more minutes. The vegetables will start to brown on the bottom first (the side in contact with a hot surface will brown faster than the sides in touch with hot air), so for even browning you'll need to turn them.
Remove from the oven and serve warm, garnished with thyme if desired.

The box says you do not need to soak, but I still recommend washing the koyadofu. Put the koyadofu in a bowl and pour hot water. The koyadofu will expand in about 10 minutes.
While you wait for the koyadofu to expand, put dashi in a pot. I use cold brew kombu dashi for this recipe, leaving the kombu behind. Add mirin and sake.
Add soy sauce, sugar, and salt.
Mix all together and slowly bring it to boil.
While waiting for the broth to boil, wash the koyadofu in clean cold water once it expands. Be careful with the koyadofu as the inside still contains hot water.
Like a sponge, let the koyadofu soak up the clean water and push it out a few times to clean. Hold the tofu flat between your hands. Squeeze the cloudy water from the inside of the koyadofu by pressing hard.
Change the water in the bowl several times to clean all the koyadofu. Thoroughly wash out the cloudy water by repeating this process several times. Give it a final squeeze.
Cut each koyadofu into 6 square pieces.
Once the dashi-soy broth is boiling, add the koyadofu and cover with a drop lid (Otoshibuta – if you don’t have one, make one with aluminum foil). You do not use a regular lid on top. Simmer for 10 minutes on medium-low heat.
When it’s about to finish simmering, prepare the snow peas by removing the tough strings. Add the snow peas in the saucepan.
Cook for 1-2 minutes. Then transfer the koyadofu to a glass container.
Make sure the glass container is big enough to hold the koyadofu and the broth. I stack the koyadofu neatly.
You can serve hot, at room temperature, or chilled after refrigerating for a few hours or overnight. Put the koyadofu, snow peas, and broth in a bowl and serve.

Also, prepare a clean container with a lid for each vegetable. You can also put all vegetables (except for eggplants) in one big container.
Measure the Weight (Important!)
Decide the amount of salt you want to use and weigh the salt (Please read the blog post). This recipe is 5% brine (50 grams of sea salt in 1000 ml of water) and made double batch (100 grams of sea salt in 2000 ml of water) as I used a lot of vegetables to demonstrate.
Weigh each vegetable you’re pickling and write down the number. At the next step, you'll need to find out the weight of the heavy objects to put on the vegetables.
Figure out which heavy object to use. Make sure to include the plate that goes under the heavy object. The total weight (object + plate) needs to be 1.5 to 2 times of the total vegetable weight. You can use several plates, pie weights in a plastic bag, etc.
Prepare the Brine
Put the measured water and sea salt in the pot and let the salt dissolved completely over medium heat. You do not need to let it boil. You can turn off the heat once it’s warm and salt is completely dissolved. Let cool. Tip: In winter, it’s fast if you put the pot outside (leaving the lid slightly ajar). In summer, make the brine the previous day.
Cut the Vegetables (If Necessary)
Eggplants: Cut off the end of eggplants. When you are making Asazuke (quick pickles), cut the eggplant in half or cut a slit vertically about half the length in the eggplant to let the salt brine absorb. Otherwise, you don’t need to cut the eggplants. Place them in the container. Tip: To prevent the beautiful eggplants from discoloring, I used 'Lucky Iron Fish' - a cooking tool that retains colors and adds iron to foods. It is optional but worth investing especially if you need more iron in your diet. You can purchase it on Amazon. I also use 'Lucky Iron Fish' when I make Kuromame.
Cucumbers: You don’t need to cut. Place them in the container.
Daikon radish: Peel and cut in half or quarters vertically depending on its size. Place them in the container.
Celeries: Remove the leafy parts and cut into the length that would fit in the container. Place them in the container.
Carrots: Peel and cut into the length that would fit in the container. Place them in the container.
To Pickle Vegetables
Eggplants: Pour the brine until they are submerged.
Place a plate on top of the vegetable, and then put a weight on the plate. You can use plates and pie weights. Make sure the vegetables are completely submerged. Place a lid on and close tightly.
Cucumbers: Pour the brine until they are submerged.
Daikon radish: Pour the brine until they are submerged.
Celeries: Pour the brine until they are submerged.
Carrots: Pour the brine until they are submerged.
Pickling Time
Keep the tsukemono at room temperature for the best pickling. For my 5% brine, the best pickling time 8 hours. Tip: You can adjust the pickling time according to your preference. Dense vegetable takes longer time to pickle than less dense vegetables. Please read the blog post.
To Take Out and Serve
Remove the eggplants and Lucky Iron Fish from the brine and transfer to a clean airtight container or resealable plastic bag.
Remove other vegetables from the brine and transfer to a clean airtight container.
To Serve
Cut the tsukemono into slices when you are ready to serve.
Serve on a plate and enjoy!
To Store
With 5% brine, you can keep the shiozuke in the refrigerator for up to 4 days. Do not cut the tsukemono into slices until you are ready to serve.

You will also need an Otoshibuta (drop lid), a large pot with a lid, and 2-3 rusty iron nails (traditional method) in a cheesecloth or Iron Fish.
Rinse black soybeans under running water and discard bad ones. Some beans have skin that is half-peeled off, but you don’t have to throw them away.
Put black soybeans, water (1200 ml, 5 cups), and the rusty nails or Iron Fish in a large pot. Let it soak overnight (6-8 hours).
After being soaked, add sugar and salt and gently mix. Keep the nails/Iron Fish in the pot.
Start cooking over medium heat. Once boiling, you start to see white bubbles.
Thoroughly skim the scum and foam off the surface.
When it's done, put an Otoshibuta and a regular pot lid. The otoshibuta is to keep the soybeans under the cooking liquid (which is to prevent the beans from getting wrinkles). Reduce heat to low and simmer (make sure beans are not bouncing around) for 4 hours or until the beans are tender.
Check inside the pot a few times to make sure there is enough cooking liquid. If not enough, add water (I added 1 cup water). Skim the surface if needed.
Check if the beans are tender by mashing a bean with two fingers. Take out the rusty nails/Iron Fish.
When the beans are tender, add soy sauce and mix well.
Remove from the heat and place the parchment paper on top of the surface to prevent the beans from getting wrinkles. Once cooled, keep in the refrigerator overnight so the soybeans will turn darker and absorb more flavor.
To Serve and Store
The following day, you can transfer the soybeans to an airtight container and store in the refrigerator for up to 4 days or in the freezer for up to a month.

Gather all the instructions.
To Prepare the Pork Belly
1.Roll up the pork belly, making sure one or both ends should have the “bacon” like appearance, showing the varying layers of meat and fat. If your slab comes with the skin (rind), it should be removed. Ask your butcher and they may remove it for you.
Run some butcher twine under the far end of the log. Tie a double knot to secure the pork tightly. Make sure you leave about 3 inches (7.5 cm) twine at the end.
Wrap around the pork belly 2-3 times around the same area to secure the end. Then pull the twine to the other end of the pork belly. Wrap around 2-3 times at the end area to secure before working toward the middle. Each wrap should be a ⅓ inch (1 cm) in between.
Continue wrapping around the pork belly toward the end (where you started). Make sure it’s wrapped as tightly as possible.
Once you reach the end, run the butcher twine under some wraps to hook and go back to the starting point. Find the 3-inch (7.5 cm) twine you leave behind.
Tie a double knot with the long twine and the 3-inch (7.5 cm) twine.
To Cut Aromatics
Cut off the green part of the long green onion and slice the ginger.
To Sear the Pork Belly
Heat the oil in a cast iron skillet (or regular frying pan) over high heat. Add the rolled pork belly in the pan.
Sear the pork belly one side at a time, rotating to make sure all sides are nicely seared.
It’ll take about 10-15 minutes all together.
To Prepare the Sauce
While searing, put all the ingredients for seasonings in a heavy-bottom pot that fits the chashu.
To Simmer Chashu
Transfer the seared chashu into the Dutch oven.
Bring the liquid to a boil.
Once boiling, skim off the foam and scum. Then turn the heat to low/simmer.
Put an otoshibuta (drop lid) on top to press the ingredient down. You do not need to use the regular lid and limit the evaporation by just otoshibuta. If you don’t have the otoshibuta, you can make it with aluminum foil (here’s how to make Otoshibuta).
Simmer on low heat, and cover with the otoshibuta at all times for the next 2 hours, rotating chashu every 30 minutes.
The sauce has been reduced. After 2 hours, turn off the heat to let cool a little bit.
To Rest Chashu Overnight
Once the meat is slightly cooled, transfer to a container or plastic food saver bag. Strain the leftover cooking liquid over a fine-mesh strainer. The liquid is roughly 2 ½ cup.
Add ½ cup of the cooking liquid into the bag.
Seal the bag with food saver. TIP: Fold a piece of paper towel to plug the entry of the Food Saver bag. This paper towel will absorb all the moisture when you seal.
I also made a quick ramen egg (ajitsuke tamago) with the leftover liquid. You make soft boiled eggs and add ½ cup of cooking liquid in the bag. Cover the cooking liquid and store chashu, ramen egg, and the cooking liquid in the refrigerator.
DAY 2
Open the bag of chashu.
Cut the twine with kitchen shears and remove them completely.
Slice the chashu into ¼ inch pieces (Keep the edge for chashu fried rice!).
Place the chashu slices on a ceramic plate and use a propane torch or broiler to sear the chashu slices to enhance the flavor. Then enjoy them immediately or serve on your ramen.
Scoop up the solidified fat from the cooking sauce.
Prepare a mason jar or container and strain the sauce over a fine-mesh sieve to make sure the solidified fat is left behind. The sauce will last for a month in the refrigerator. I use it for drizzling over the chashu and making stir-fries, marinade, and ramen eggs.
To Store
You can store the chashu in the refrigerator up to 7 days and 1 month in the freezer. I usually divide the rolled chashu into thirds and freeze 2 portions separately (for Ramen right away, and chashu fried rice and chashu Don for later). Ramen eggs should be consumed in 3-4 days if they are soft-boiled eggs and 7 days if hard-boiled eggs. The eggs get salty as you keep in the marinade, so remove from the sauce when they have the right taste.
FOR NON-ROLLED CHASHU
Gather all the ingredients. For small blocks of pork belly, you don't need to roll them up before cooking and simmering time is just 1 hour (instead of 2 hours).
Heat the oil in a cast iron skillet (or regular frying pan) over high heat. Sear the fat side down first, then flip over to sear all sides, which will take about 10 minutes.
While searing, put all the ingredients for seasonings in a heavy-bottom pot (or regular pot) that fits the chashu. Add the chashu and bring it to a boil, skimming the scum and foam. Then turn the heat to low/simmer.
Put an otoshibuta (drop lid) on top to press the ingredient down and limit the evaporation. If you don’t have an otoshibuta, you can make it with aluminum foil. (here’s how to make otoshibuta). Simmer on low heat for the next one hour, rotating chashu every 15 minutes (keep otoshibuta on all times!).
After one hour, there is ½ inch liquid left in the pot. Now you have 2 options. Option 1: If you're serving right away, remove the otoshibuta and further cook down the sauce on low heat until the sauce gets thicken and see the bottom of the pot when you draw a line with a spatula. Option 2 (recommended): Transfer the chashu to a container or a bag with a little bit of cooking sauce and refrigerate overnight. Strain the leftover cooking sauce and refrigerate.
To serve, slice the chashu into ¼ inch pieces. You can use a propane torch or broiler to sear the chashu slices to enhance the flavor. If you kept the chashu overnight and don't want to sear the chashu, you can reheat it by soaking in the hot cooking sauce.",en-US,4.61,,Just One Cookbook,640,8 serving(s),,,,,,,,,,

Dried Shiitake Mushrooms
In a small bowl, put dried shiitake mushrooms and 1 cup water and soak for 20-30 minutes, or until tender.
After 30 minutes or so, squeeze the liquid out from the shiitake mushrooms.
Cut the shiitake mushrooms into a hexagon, which represents turtle shape for longevity.
Strain the liquid through a fine-mesh sieve. This is called shiitake dashi. It yields roughly ¾ cup.
Chicken
Remove extra fat of the chicken and cut into 1 ½ inch (3.8 cm) pieces.
Transfer the chicken in a medium bowl and add ½ Tbsp sake and ½ Tbsp soy sauce. Coat the chicken with the marinade and set aside.
Burdock Root (Gobo)
Scrape the skin off the burdock root with the back of the knife. After rinsing, cut it into thin slices.
Prepare a bowl of 2 cups water and ½ Tbsp vinegar. Soak the burdock root in the water for 15 minutes.
Japanese Taro Roots (Satoimo)
Cut off the ends of taro. Then peel from one end to the other.
Ideally, taro should be a hexagon (6 sides) from the side view.
Cut the taro in half and soak in water. You can rub them with salt to get rid of the sliminess if that bothers you.
Bamboo Shoot
Cut the bamboo shoot into quarters lengthwise.
Cut the bamboo shoot in half widthwise. If each piece is still bigger than bite-size, you can cut in half.
Lotus Roots (Renkon)
Cut the lotus root into Hana Renkon.
The lotus root should resemble flowers after cutting the edges off.
Cut them into ⅛ inch (3 mm) slices. Prepare a bowl of 2 cups water and ½ Tbsp vinegar. Soak the lotus root in the water for 15 minutes.
Carrot (Nejiri Ume)
Peel the carrot and cut into ½ inch (1.3 cm) pieces.
Use a flower-shaped vegetable cutter and cut out each piece into a flower shape. Then make a shallow (roughly ¼ inch deep) incision from the center of the flower to in-between the two petals.
Hold a knife parallel to one petal and make a diagonal cut from right to left in-between petals.
This is called Nejiri Ume.
Konnyaku
Cut konnyaku into ¼ inch (6 mm) slices and then make a 1 ½ inch (3.8 cm) incision in the middle.
Put one end of konnyaku into the hole in the middle and pull it out. This is called Tazuna Konnyaku.
Snow Peas
Pull the strings at the seams of the snow peas and discard them. These are tough and not edible.
To Blanch Vegetables and Konnyaku
Boil water in a saucepan and blanch half of the flower carrot for 2 minutes and set aside.
Add a pinch of salt and blanch the snow pea pods for 30-60 seconds, until crisp but tender enough to eat.
Remove the snow peas from the water and transfer to the ice water to stop cooking and set aside.
In the same boiling water, add konnyaku. After boiling again, cook for 2-3 minutes to remove the smell.
Diagonally cut the blanched snow peas in half and set aside.
To Make Chikuzenni
In the large pot, heat 1 Tbsp of sesame oil over medium heat. When it’s hot, add the chicken.
Cook the chicken until it turns white. Transfer the chicken to a plate.
Add ½ Tbsp sesame oil and cook all the ingredients except the blanched snow peas and carrots reserved for decoration.
Stir and coat the ingredients with sesame oil.
Add dashi and shiitake dashi.
Bring it to a simmer over medium heat. Skim off the fat and scum that accumulates on the surface.
Add sake, mirin, sugar, soy sauce, and salt.
Add the chicken back into the pot. Bring it to a simmer. As you see, the stock should cover about 80% of the ingredients.
Put an otoshibuta (drop lid) on the ingredients and cook for 10 minutes. If you don't have one, you can make an Otoshibuta with aluminum foil.
Remove Otoshibuta and cook for another 10 minutes.
Insert a bamboo skewer into tough vegetables (taro root and lotus root) and see if they are tender. Taste and adjust seasonings if needed.
To Serve
Add the snow peas and remove from the heat. Cover, and let cool. Serve Chikuzenni in a serving dish or Osechi box. Top with the snow peas and blanched flower shaped carrots.
To Store
Keep the leftovers in an airtight container and store it in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. The flavor will intensify as time passes, so if you plan to serve it later, you may consider reducing the amount of seasoning.

Rinse the rice under cold water, by gently rubbing the rice with your fingertips in a circling motion. Submerge the rice in water and pour out the starchy water. Rinse and repeat until the water becomes clear. Soak rice in water for 20-30 minutes. Meanwhile, start preparing the next ingredients. After soaking for 20-30 minutes, drain water completely and set aside for 10 minutes. If you don’t have time to wait, then shake off the excess water the best you can.
To Prepare Katsuo Dashi
Add 1 ½ cup water in a saucepan and bring it to almost boil. Add 1 cup packed katsuobushi to the water, reduce the heat, simmer for 30 seconds, and turn off the heat. Set aside and let the katsuobushi sink to the bottom, about 10 minutes.
Strain the dashi through a fine-mesh sieve over a liquid measuring cup. You need exactly 340 ml. If you don’t have enough, add water. If you have too much, then take it out. Tip: You can use used katsuobushi for Second Dashi (Niban Dashi) or make homemade furikake.
Add 2 Tbsp sake, 2 Tbsp usukuchi soy sauce (or regular soy sauce), and ½ tsp kosher salt. Usukuchi soy sauce (lighter color soy sauce) will not darken the rice as much as regular soy sauce.
Mix well to combine and let the salt dissolve completely. At the end, you should have 400 ml of broth.
To Prepare Ingredients
Prepare boiling water and pour over the aburaage to remove excess oil. Cut in half first and then cut into thin strips. Squeeze excess water out.
Open the packaged bamboo shoot and cut in half. Some pieces may be bigger or smaller, but you will need 5.3 oz (150 g).
Then cut the halves into quarters. The key here is to cut into smaller pieces so it’s easy to eat with rice. I usually keep the tip of bamboo, roughly ¾ inch length as intact (a triangle shape looks cute for presentation).
Then for the rest of bottom bamboo parts, cut into thin slices.
To Cook Rice
The rice should be drained well by now. Add the rice into the donabe (or rice cooker/heavy bottom pot). Pour 400 ml broth you prepared, and make sure the rice is evenly distributed in the pot.
Evenly distribute the aburaage over the rice (DO NOT MIX with rice) and then bamboo shoot on top of aburaage (again do not mix with the rest). Rice needs to be steamed nicely and evenly and when it’s mixed with other ingredients, it will not be cooked.
If you’re using the Kamado-san, place the inner lid and then the donabe lid. Cook on medium-high heat (or medium for a professional stove) for 14 minutes.
Once it’s cooked, remove from the stove and set aside for 20 minutes.
Cooking with Rice Cooker
Choose “regular” or “mixed rice” mode and start cooking. If you use “regular” setting, let it steam for 10 minutes more to create “okoge” (burnt rice).
Cooking On the Stove
Bring it to boil on medium heat (you can peek to see if it’s boiling). Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook for 15 minutes, or until liquid is completely gone.

In a small pot, boil 1 ¾ (400 ml) cups water. Once boiling, add katsuobushi.
Mix together and turn off the heat. Set aside for 15 minutes. Then strain the katsuobushi with a fine-mesh sieve. Set the katsuo dashi aside for now. You can discard the katsuobushi or make furikake (rice seasonings) with the leftover katsuobushi.
Remove the seeds from the kabocha and microwave it for 2 minutes to soften the outer kabocha skin. You can skip microwaving if you have a sharp knife and the strength to cut through the skin.
Cut the kabocha into wedges, then equal 2” (5 cm) pieces. Remember, kabocha skin is edible and nutritious.
In a large pot, place the kabocha pieces in a single layer, skin side down.
Add dashi, sake, and sugar. Tip: Swirl the pot to mix the seasonings so you won't break the kabocha.
Cook on medium high heat and bring it to a boil.
Add soy sauce and salt, and swirl the pot again to mix the seasonings. If the liquid does not cover ¾ of kabocha, you can add a little bit of water. Bring to a boil again.
Once boiling turn down to medium-low heat to maintain the simmer. Cover with an otoshibuta (drop lid) and cook for 20-30 minutes (depends on size, and skin takes time to cook), or until the kabocha has a tiny thin crack near the skin (it’s a sign for doneness!). If you feel that liquid is evaporating too fast, you can cover the regular lid (and you still need to use otoshibuta).
Remove from the heat and let kabocha sit covered (with a pot lid) until cool, about 30 minutes. This helps kabocha absorbs more flavor as it cools. You can serve at room temperature or reheat before serving.
Optional Garnish
Cut the ginger into thin slabs and then thin julienne strips.

The rice to water ratio is 1 : 1.1 (or 1.2 ). Please read the blog post for a detailed explanation.
To Rinse the Rice
Overfill the plastic rice cooker cup (180 ml) and level off. In this recipe, I'm using 3 rice cooker cups (540 ml).
Add water just enough till it submerges all the rice. Then discard the water immediately. Repeat this process 2-3 times. Tip: Rice absorbs water very quickly when you start rinsing, so don't let the rice absorb the first few rounds of water.
Use your fingers to gently wash the rice in a circular motion for 10-15 seconds. Repeat this process 1-2 times.
Add water and discard the water. Repeat this process 1-2 times.
Repeat this process 2 more times.
When the water is almost clear, drain well. Tip: Use a fine-mesh sieve to drain and shake off excess water.
Transfer the drained rice to the rice cooker (I use the Zojirushi IH). Add water (600 ml for my 3 rice cooker cups).
To Cook the Rice
Soak the rice for 20-30 minutes (especially if you're using an older rice cooker). Select your menu and press ""Start"". Tip: Even though my rice cooker includes soaking time, I soak my rice for 20-30 minutes. Note: For this Zojirushi rice cooker, 3-cup ""regular"" white rice takes 55 minutes to cook, which already includes a 10-minute soaking time and 10-minute steaming time in the program.
Once the rice is done cooking, let it steam for 10 minutes (if your rice cooker does not include the steaming time). Open the lid and fluff the rice with a rice paddle.
To Store Cooked Rice
Transfer the rice in airtight containers and close the lid to keep the moisture in. Let cool completely before storing the containers in the freezer (read my tutorial post).",en-US,4.55,,Just One Cookbook,60,2 serving(s),,,,,,,,,,

Bring a pot of water to a boil. Even if your sesame seeds are toasted/roasted, it’s good to toast them again in a non-greased frying pan for a couple of minutes, gently jiggling the pan. Be careful not to burn them.
With a pestle and a mortar (or spice grinder), grind the sesame seeds, leaving some seeds uncrushed to add texture to the sauce.
Add soy sauce and sugar and mix it all together. The dressing looks more like a paste than dressing. Set aside.
To prepare the green beans. If your green beans are not trimmed, snap the tip of one end of the bean with your fingers and draw it down the length of one side of the bean to remove any possible string. Do the same thing with the other end, pulling it down the other side of the bean.
Add a pinch of salt and the green beans to the boiling water.
Cook the green beans for 4-5 minutes (3 minutes for French green beans/Haricots Verts) until they are bright green and tender but still crunchy.
Remove from the heat, place in a strainer, and quickly rinse them in cold water to stop them from cooking further (or you can transfer them to an ice-water bath). Shocking the green beans with cold water will help the beans stay green. You don’t need to chill them; the beans should still be warm.

Cut the broccoli and cauliflower into florets.
Cut the napa cabbage into bite-size pieces.
To Steam
Pour the dashi in your steamer, cover the lid, and bring it to boil on medium-high heat. As a quick guide, dashi (or water) should be at least 1-2 inches to your steamer (pot). Insert the steamer basket. Make sure the surface of the dashi (or water) is not touching the basket. If it is, take out some water.
When steam is coming out from the pot strongly, reduce the heat to medium and place the hard vegetables such as sweet potatoes and root vegetables. I also added kabocha squash and corn here as the rest of ingredients are fairly fast to cook. Cover the pot and set timer for 5 minutes.
Then add “Flower” vegetables such as asparagus, broccoli, cauliflower, and the bottom part of the napa cabbage. I also added carrot peels here. Set the timer for 3 minutes.
Lastly, add the leafy part of the napa cabbage and mini tomatoes. Cook for 2 more minutes.
Insert a bamboo skewer to check the doneness of denser vegetables. If it goes through, it’s ready to eat! Stop the steaming when the vegetables are still a bit crunchy since the residual heat will continue to cook the vegetables.
Serve the steamed vegetables with Miso Sesame Sauce and enjoy! During the meal, you can continue to steam the vegetables. Keep an eye on the dashi/water inside the pot.

For Japanese short-grain rice, the ideal rice to water ratio is 1 : 1.1 (or 1.2), which is 10-20% more water. For easy American ""cup"" measurement, I used 25% in this recipe (rice to water ratio is 1 : 1.25). If you have a precise milliliter measuring cup or kitchen scale, use the following measurement. 200 ml water for 1 rice cooker cup (180 ml). 400 ml water for 2 rice cooker cups (360 ml). 600 ml water for 3 rice cooker cups (540 ml). 800 ml water for 4 rice cooker cups (720 ml). 1000 ml water for 5 rice cooker cups (900 ml).
Put rice in a large bowl. Rice absorbs water very quickly when you start washing, so don't let the rice absorb the unclear water. Gently wash the rice in a circular motion and discard the water. Repeat this process about 3-4 times. Drain to a fine-mesh sieve and shake off excess water.
In a heavy-bottomed pot with a tight-fitting lid, put well-drained rice and measured water. Soak the rice for 20-30 minutes before cooking.
To Cook Rice
Close the lid and bring it to a boil over medium heat. Take a quick peek to see if water is boiling (otherwise do not open the lid).
Once water is boiling, turn the heat to low and cook covered for 12 to 13 minutes, or until the water is completely absorbed (take a quick peek!). If you see there is water left, close the lid and continue cooking for a little longer.
Remove the pot (with the lid on) from the heat source and let it steam for another 10 minutes.
Fluff the rice with a rice paddle when it’s done.
To Store Rice
Transfer the rice in airtight containers and close the lid to keep the moisture in. Let cool completely before storing the containers in the freezer (read my tutorial post).",en-US,4.75,,Just One Cookbook,50,2 serving(s),,,,,,,,,,

To Prepare Sesame Sauce
In a frying pan (do not add oil), toast sesame seeds (2 Tbsp) until they are fragrant and starting to pop. Keep some distance from the heat and shake the pan to toast.
Transfer to a mortar (suribachi). Using a pestle (surikogi), grind the sesame seeds until 80% of the sesame seeds are ground (to keep the texture of sesame seeds).
Add soy sauce (1 Tbsp), mirin (1 Tbsp), and rice vinegar (1 tsp) to the sesame seeds.
To Prepare Gobo
Peel gobo skin with the back of a knife. Don’t use a vegetable peeler to peel gobo’s skin because the earthy delicious flavor is just right below the skin and you don’t want to peel it off.
Cut the gobo into 5 inches (12 cm), and then cut each piece in half. If it’s a very thick piece, you can cut that piece in half again.
Add 1 tsp rice vinegar (1 tsp) in the water (4 cups, 960ml). Soak gobo in vinegar water for 3 minutes so the gobo retains its color. Drain and set aside.
To Cook Gobo
Add gobo in the saucepan filled with water (4 cups, 960 ml). Bring it to a boil. Once boiling, lower the heat to medium and cook for 13-15 minutes, or until the gobo is tender but firm. Drain gobo and transfer to the cutting board.
To Dress with Sesame Sauce
Pound gobo with the pestle (surikogi or a rolling pin from end to end until the fibers are smashed. This allows the sauce to go through the fibers of the gobo. Then cut them in half (2.5 inches/6 cm pieces).
While gobo is still hot, transfer into the sesame sauce and coat well. Gobo can absorb the flavors when they are hot.

Put sake lees in a medium bowl and bring it to room temperature on the counter so it becomes much more pliable.
Check the texture of sake lees with your fingers. If they feel solid firm, add sake first and microwave for a few seconds until it becomes pliable. Otherwise, combine sake lees with miso, sugar, and salt first.
Using your hand, mix the ingredients and knead well until well combined.
Add sake a little bit at a time to combine with the sake lee mixture. See the consistency to see if you need to add more sake. Each sake lee brand may have a different consistency and you may not need all of sake (or you may need more). The consistency you’re looking for is similar to miso, not too loose not too hard.
Knead until kasudoko becomes paste form and then transfer to a glass container where you want to pickle your ingredients.
To Make Cucumber Kasuzuke
Gather all the ingredients for cucumber kasuzuke.
Sprinkle salt over cucumbers. The amount of salt used is 2% of the weight of cucumber. Here I use 500 grams of cucumbers; therefore, I’ll need 10 grams of salt. Using hands, rub the salt into the cucumbers.
Set aside for 1 hour. Salt will draw moisture from the cucumbers.
After 1 hour, dry the moisture on the cucumbers with a paper towel. And transfer the cucumbers into the misodoko.
Completely cover the cucumbers with misodoko.
Once the cucumbers are embedded, cover the container with the lid. Store in the refrigerator for half day (maximum 24 hours).
With clean hands, take out the cucumbers from kasudoko, leaving the sake lees in the container.
Slice the cucumbers and serve in a dish. Tsukemono is always served along with steamed rice and miso soup. Enjoy the cucumber kasuzuke within 3 days.

Day 1
Combine 1 cup water and 1 Tbsp salt and mix well. Peel daikon.
Cut the daikon in half widthwise and half in lengthwise. If your daikon is thinner, you may just cut in half widthwise.
Put the daikon in a resealable plastic bag and add saltwater. Remove air and seal tightly. Daikon has strong-smelling sulfur compounds and it gets quite smelly. If you decide not to use a resealable plastic bag, you will need a large airtight container such as a big jar that can include daikon, saltwater, and heavy objects on top of the daikon.
Put the bag in a tray to avoid any leakage and put a heavy object on top of the bag. Here I put a plate (to evenly distribute the weight) and pie weights. Set aside at room temperature overnight.
Day 2
To make Shio Koji Mixture, combine ½ cup shio koji and ¼ cup sugar in a 1-cup measuring cup (or bowl). Cut off the end of red chili pepper with a knife or a pair of scissors.
Take out and discard the seeds (typically, the Japanese do not include seeds and use just the pod for mild spiciness). Cut the red chili pepper into small rounds and add to the mixture.
Cut the kombu into thin strips and add to the mixture. Mix all together. Set aside.
Remove the heavy objects, and take out the daikon. Discard the salt water.
Wipe off the moisture on the daikon with a paper towel.
In an airtight container that fits the daikon, pour half of your Shio Koji Mixture on the bottom of the container. Put the daikon on top.
Add and distribute the rest of the mixture. Put the lid on and keep at the room temperature for 2-3 hours, then transfer to the refrigerator for 2-3 days.
When to Stop Pickling
You can start eating from the day you add Shio Koji Mixture. It’s up to you when you want to stop pickling. You can take out all the daikon after 1 day, for example. As time passes, moisture comes out more form the daikon and it gets slimy from kombu. When the daikon is pickled enough (to your liking), take them out and transfer to another airtight container to keep for a week or two. I usually take out and eat one daikon each day and finish all of it by the 3rd day.
To Serve
If you prefer to serve pickled daikon without koji (grain), you can quickly rinse under running water. Cut the daikon into ¼ inch (6 mm) slices and enjoy!

Wash the taro with water and drain. Cut both ends and peel the skin. Taro will be slimy so be careful when you’re handling with the knife.

Place the taro in a large pot and fill up with water to cover the taro. Bring the water to boil.
Once boiling, reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes, or until the skewer goes through. Pre-blanching helps to absorb flavors when you simmer with seasonings. Drain and remove the sliminess under warm water.
Heat the oil in the pot. Add the taro and quickly coat with the oil. The oil helps lock in all the flavors inside the taro and prevent umami from going away. It also helps to keep the shape without breaking into pieces.
Add dashi, sake and sugar, and bring to boil. Skim if necessary.
Lower the heat and place otoshibuta (drop lid) and simmer for 5 minutes.
Remove otoshibuta and add soy sauce (adding soy sauce later helps the sweet flavors easily soak in). Place the otoshibuta back and simmer for 20-25 minutes (depends on the size of taro - mine is large). Lastly, add mirin and gently shake the pot to coat the taro with the sauce.

Make sure the rice is evenly distributed and flat. Close the lid.
Set HIGH pressure for 2 minutes. Make sure the steam release handle points at “sealing” and not “venting.” The float valve goes up when pressurized (it takes roughly 5 minutes to pressurize). When it’s finished cooking, the Instant Pot will switch automatically to the “Keep Warm” mode. Let the pressure release naturally for 10 minutes and then proceed with quick release (DO NOT EXCEED MORE THAN 10 MINS.

For serving the rice ball, keep 6 shiso leaves aside (they will be placed under the rice ball later). Roll up the rest of shiso leaves and cut into julienned strips.
Add shiso leaves and roasted white sesame seeds in the bowl of steamed rice. Using a rice scooper, fluff up the rice while you mix in shiso leaves and sesame seeds.
Prepare a small bowl of water and a plate of kosher salt, roughly 2 to 3 tsp. Wet your palms with water, dip your fingers into the salt and rub some of the salt lightly onto your palms. Then using a rice scooper, scoop 1/6 portion of the steamed rice (you should be able to make 6 rice balls).
Gently form the rice into a ball shape, and then flatten top and bottom. It should look like a thick disk shape.
Cut the parchment paper to fit the bottom of your frying pan and place it on the pan. Brush the oil on the parchment paper. Place the rice balls and start cooking on medium heat. Make sure to keep some distance between rice balls so they don’t stick to each other.

Increase the marinate ingredients if you cook more than 4 eggs.
In a resealable plastic bag, combine soy sauce, mirin, and water. Tip 1: If you plan to make the ramen eggs in just a few hours of marinating, use 0-1 Tbsp water. Otherwise, start with 2-3 Tbsp water and taste before adding more water. You have to adjust the saltiness to your taste and how long you plan to marinade. Tip 2: To use the minimal amount of the condiments (as we have to discard after marinating), I use a plastic bag. If you use a container, you will need to double the amount of condiment to cover the eggs.
Bring water to a boil in a medium saucepan. There should be enough water to cover the eggs (should be 1 inch above eggs).
When boiling, take out the eggs from the refrigerator and carefully and slowly submerge the eggs into the boiling water with a mesh strainer/skimmer or ladle to prevent the eggs from cracking.
Immediately reduce heat to maintain a simmer (gentle boil) and cook the eggs for exactly 7 minutes. [Runny egg yolk - 6 to 6 ½ minutes. Custard-like egg yolk but not runny - 8 to 9 minutes.] Make sure the water is simmering, but not so hot that the eggs bounce around. If you want your egg yolk to be in the center, gently rotate the eggs with chopsticks once in a while for the first 3 minutes so the egg yolk will be in the center.

To Cook Rice
1 rice cooker cup (180 ml, 150 g) yields roughly 330 g of cooked rice, which is roughly 1 ¾ US cups. One sushi roll requires ½ - ¾ cup (90-135 g) of sushi rice.
Put rice in a large bowl. Rinse the rice and discard the water immediately. Rice absorbs water very quickly when you start washing, so don't let the rice absorb the unclear water. Repeat this process 1-2 times.
Now use your fingers to gently wash the rice by moving in a circular motion.
Rinse and discard water. Repeat this process 3-4 times.
Repeat the rinsing process 3-4 times until the water is almost clear.
Transfer the rice into a sieve and drain completely.
Gently wipe the dashi kombu with a damp cloth (it's a traditional method but these days kombu is much cleaner). DO NOT wipe off the white powdery substances, which contribute to the umami flavor in dashi. NEVER wash the kombu.
Put the rice in the rice cooker bowl and add water (never hot or warm!) to just under the 3-cup line. If your rice cooker has a ""Sushi Rice"" mode, add water till that line. Place the kombu on top of the rice, soak rice in water for 20-30 minutes, and start cooking. If you don't have a rice cooker, cook rice in a pot over the stove, an instant pot, or a donabe. Tip: Since you add sushi vinegar to the cooked rice, the rice should be cooked a little bit on the firm side and the water to rice ratio for sushi rice should be 1 to 1 (instead of 1 to 1.1 or 1 to 1.2 for regular steamed rice).
To Make Sushi Vinegar
To make sushi vinegar, combine rice vinegar, sugar, and salt in a small saucepan and bring it to a boil over medium-high heat. Whisk until the sugar is completely dissolved. You can also put the ingredients in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave for 1 minute, or till sugar is dissolved. Set aside to let it cool.
To Make Sushi Rice
When the rice is cooked, moisten sushi oke/hangiri (a round, flat-bottom wooden tub) or a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, or a large moisten glass bowl. Transfer the cooked rice into the sushi oke and spread out evenly so the rice will cool faster. While it’s hot, pour sushi vinegar over the rice. Tip: If you're making more/less rice or using the sushi vinegar bottle, the required sushi vinegar for rice should be roughly 8-10% of the cooked rice weight.
With a rice paddle, slice the rice at a 45 degree to separate the chunks of rice instead of mixing. At the same time, you need to use a fan to cool rice so the rice will shine and doesn't get mushy.
Then gently flip the rice in between slices. Repeat this process until the rice is cooled to the temperature of human skin.
To Keep
Keep the rice covered with a damp towel (or paper towel) at the room temperature until ready to use.
To Store
Rice gets hard and dry in the refrigerator. Therefore, my recommendation (even you plan to use it soon) is to put sushi rice in an airtight container and store in the freezer for up to a month. You can defrost overnight in the fridge or microwave, but bring it to room temperature (not hot). If you really want to refrigerate, cover the container with a thick kitchen towel, so the rice will stay cool and safe, but not become cold.",en-US,4.58,,Just One Cookbook,100,5 serving(s),,,,,,,,,,

Add ¼ cup (50 g) short-grain rice in a bowl and rinse under running water while gently rubbing the rice with hands. Repeat until the water runs clear and drain.
Put the rice back in a donabe (I used a small Japanese earthenware pot) or a heavy-bottomed pot, add 250 ml of water, and cover with a lid. Soak the rice for at least 30 minutes. Tip: With the heavy-bottomed pot like a donabe, the heat is distributed not as strongly/directly as a regular pot, so you can cook rice evenly.
Bring the rice to a boil over medium-high heat. You can open the lid to check during this time.
As soon as it's boiling, gently mix with the spoon once, making sure rice is not stuck to the bottom of the pot. Then lower the heat to the stove’s lowest heat setting (make sure to use the right size of stove burner for your pot size), cover the lid, and simmer the rice for 25-30 minutes. During this time, don't open the lid or mix the rice (See Note).
After 25-30 minutes, turn off the heat and set aside for 10 minutes to let it steam. The rice should be soft and thickened.

Once the rice is done cooking, add 2 tsp white sesame seeds and fluff the rice with a rice scooper. Roughly divide the rice into 6 equal portions.
To Make Rice Balls
First wet both of your hands with water in order to keep the rice from sticking to your hands. Gently tap 2-3 finger tips in kosher salt and rub to spread all around your palms (Why using salt? Please read Notes below). If you are using table salt, use half the amount as it is saltier than kosher salt.
Scoop out one portion into one hand. Then mold the rice with your hands by pressing it down gently to form a barrel shape (or any shape you like).

To Prepare Steamed Rice
You can also cook short-grain rice with a rice cooker, an instant pot, or a donabe.
Put the rice in a large bowl and gently wash the rice in a circular motion and discard the water. Repeat this process about 3-4 times.
Let the rice soak in water for 30 minutes. Transfer the rice into a sieve and drain completely, at least 15 minutes.
Combine the rice and water in a heavy-bottom pot. A heavy-bottom pot with a tight-fitting lid is recommended as it is thicker at the base so it absorbs and distributes heat better. Cover the lid and bring it to a boil over medium heat.
Once water is boiling, turn the heat to the lowest setting and continue to cook covered for 12 to 13 minutes, or until the water is completely absorbed. At 12-13 minute mark, take a quick peek and if you see there is any water left, close the lid and continue cooking for another minute or so.
Remove the pot (with the lid on) from the heat and let it steam for another 10 minutes. Then transfer the rice to a large plate or baking sheet lined with parchment paper (I use Sushi Oke). Fluff the rice with a rice scooper. Let the cooked rice cool a little bit until you can hold rice without burning your hands. However, do not let the rice completely cool down.
To Prepare Onigiri Fillings
While rice is being soaked and drained (45 minutes), prepare the onigiri fillings.
Salted salmon filling: Sprinkle kosher salt on both sides of the salmon fillet. Bake at 425ºF (218ºC) in a toaster oven or oven for 10-20 minutes. Japanese salted salmon is cooked till well done (more dry and flaky).
Break the cooked salmon into flakes and set aside.
Umeboshi filling: Place umeboshi (Japanese pickled plums) on a 10” x 10” sheet of plastic wrap. Fold in half and squeeze the seed out from each umeboshi. Discard the seeds and keep the umeboshi flesh.
Okaka filling: Put katsuobushi (dried bonito flakes) in a bowl and add 2 Tbsp soy sauce. Mix to combine. Katsuobushi should be moistened but not drenched in soy sauce.
Tuna mayo filling: Put drained canned tuna in a bowl and add 2 Tbsp Japanese mayonnaise and ½ Tbsp soy sauce. Mix to combine.
Seasoned kombu filling: Put the purchased seasoned kombu in a bowl for easy access later.
To Make Onigiri
Cut the nori sheets in thirds (⅓).
First, wet both of your hands with water in order to prevent the rice from sticking to your hands.
Then put some salt in your hands and rub to spread all around your palms. How much salt? I dip 3 finger tips in kosher salt shown in the picture below. If you are using table salt, use half amount as it’s saltier than kosher salt.
Scoop out a handful of warm rice (about ⅓ cup) into one hand. Create a small well (indentation) in the center of the rice. Put one kind of filling (about 1-2 tsp) inside. Then mold the rice with your hands around the well to cover your filling completely.
Press the rice around the filling to gently form the rice into a triangle. I use three fingers (thumb, index finger, middle finger) to make a triangle corner. Your hands should be just firm enough so the onigiri doesn't fall apart. You don't want to squeeze the rice too tight.
Wrap the onigiri with nori seaweed.
Place a little bit of each filling on top of onigiri so we know which kind it is.
Alternative Method of Making Onigiri
If you do not want to touch the rice at all, you can place a piece of plastic wrap in a rice bowl (or any small bowl) and put the rice on top. Sprinkle some kosher salt (remember, salt is used to preserve the rice for a long time here).
Pull the plastic wrap corners and twist a few times.
Form into a triangle shape with the same manner as I described above.
To Store
Onigiri (or any rice dish) gets hard when you refrigerate. The cold air makes the rice dry and hard (which is perfect for fried rice!). I don't recommend making onigiri ahead of time. But if you really need to, my trick is to wrap the onigiri with thick kitchen towels and store in the fridge.

Bring a medium pot of water to a boil. Put chestnuts in boiling water, cover with the lid, and turn off the heat. Set aside for 30 minutes and drain (It’s easier to peel when they are still warm).
Using a knife, make an incision around the edge where the flat surface and bottom of a chestnut meets. Then start peeling the shell.
Then peel the inner skin completely and soak in a bowl of water for 10 minutes. Peel the rest of chestnuts and change the water a few times.
Put the rice, water, sake, and salt in a heavy bottom pot and lightly mix all together. Then place chestnuts on top.
Bring the rice to a boil over medium heat. Take a quick peek to see if water is boiling (otherwise do not open the lid). Once water is boiling, turn the heat to low and cook covered for 12 to 13 minutes, or until the water is completely absorbed (take a quick peek!). If you see there is still water left, close the lid and continue cooking for a little longer.
Remove the pot with the lid on from the heat source and let the rice steam for 10 minutes before opening the lid.

Rinse the rice and drain well. For detailed instructions, click here.
Boil water in a small saucepan and pour on top of the aburaage. This will remove the oil in the aburaage (the manufacture’s oil doesn’t taste good, so this extra step will improve the flavor of the aburaage).
Cut in half lengthwise and slice thinly into strips.
Peel the ginger and cut it into julienned pieces.
Mix all the ingredients for the seasonings in a 2-cup measuring cup. Then add water to the seasonings so that the liquid totals 1 ½ cup or 360 ml (equal volume as rice).
Place the well-drained rice into the rice cooker. No rice cooker? You can also make rice in a pot over the stove, an instant pot, or a donabe. Pour the liquid into the rice cooker and mix well, and add ginger and aburaage on top. Do not mix. Rice cooks evenly when it is not mixed with other ingredients.
Soak for 20-30 minutes and then start cooking. If you have a “Mixed Rice” option, use it (See Notes below). When the rice is done, let it steam for another 10 minutes. Fluffy it up with the rice paddle and serve.

Make dashi if you don’t have it around already and let it cool to room temperature (you can place the pot with dashi in it over a bowl of iced water).
To Prepare Rice
In a large bowl, measure and add 2 rice measuring cups (360 ml). Rinse the rice under cold water, by gently rubbing the rice with your fingertips in a circling motion. Submerge the rice in water and pour out the starchy water. Rinse and repeat until the water becomes clear. Soak rice in water for 20-30 minutes. Meanwhile, start preparing the ingredients.
Here's how the rice looks before and after soaking for 20 minutes. Drain water completely. Set aside for 10 minutes. If you don’t have time to wait, then shake off the excess water the best you can.
To Prepare Ingredients
In a small bowl, add dried shiitake mushrooms and ¼ cup water. Put a heavy object on top so the shiitake mushrooms will be submerged under water. Let them soaked till tender or while you prep other ingredients.
Cut the chicken thigh into slanted, smaller bite-sized pieces. I use “Sogigiri” Japanese cutting technique to create more surface so it will cook faster. Add ½ Tbsp sake to remove any unwanted smell from the chicken.
Peel gobo skin with the back of a knife. You don’t use a vegetable peeler to peel gobo’s skin because the earthy delicious flavor is just right below the skin and you don’t want to peel it off. Cut the gobo in half lengthwise.
Thinly slice each half diagonally. Soak the gobo in water to prevent it from turning brown and to remove any astringent taste.
Cut the carrot in half lengthwise and thinly slice diagonally.
Pour hot water over aburaage to get rid of the excess oil. Some people skip this step as the oil is cleaner these days. I do it anyway. Cut in half lengthwise.
Cut the tofu pouch into thin slices and squeeze water out.
Roughly, you will need ⅓ cup each of sliced carrot, sliced gobo, and sliced aburaage.
By now shiitake mushrooms should be hydrated and tender. Squeeze them to remove the excess liquid in the bowl. We will use this reserved liquid “Shiitake Dashi”. Remove the stem from each shiitake mushrooms.
Thinly slice the mushrooms. If it’s a big mushroom, cut the slices in half.
In a 2-cup measuring cup, add 2 Tbsp shiitake dashi (the reserved liquid from hydrating shiitake mushrooms). If you are worried about small particles that are left in the liquid, you can strain the liquid using a tea strainer. Then in the same measuring cup, add 1 ½ Tbsp soy sauce, 1 Tbsp mirin, and ½ tsp salt.
Lastly, add dashi so that the seasoning is 360 ml.
In a large bowl, add chicken, shiitake mushrooms, carrot, gobo, aburaage, and the seasoning from the previous step. Mix well.
To Cook Rice
Transfer drained rice and make sure the rice is evenly distributed and flat.
Add the ingredients and seasoning liquid on top of the rice. DO NOT MIX rice and the ingredients. Try to evenly distribute the ingredients and flatten without mixing with rice.
Close the lid and click MANUAL. Set HIGH pressure for 2 minutes.
Make sure the steam release handle points at “sealing” and not “venting.” The float valve goes up when pressurized (it takes roughly 10 minutes to pressurize).
When it’s finished cooking, the Instant Pot will beep and switch automatically to the “Keep Warm” mode. Let the pressure release naturally for 10 minutes (10-minute natural release) and then proceed with a quick release by turning the steam release handle to the “venting” position to let steam out until the float valve drops down. DO NOT EXCEED MORE THAN 10 MINS. I recommend setting a timer. When you do a quick release, hold a kitchen towel and do not place your hand or face over steam release valve. The steam should be left only a little bit after 10 minutes of natural release.
Fluff the rice with a rice scooper immediately to avoid burning the rice on the bottom. Instead of “mixing”, try to “cut” the rice at a 45 degrees angle as you fluff.
Cut the mitsuba into small pieces. If you don’t have mitsuba, you can use green onion.
Serve Takikomi Gohan in individual bowls and garnish with mitsuba.

Please read and follow the black soybean package instructions. Some packages may say ""soak overnight"". My package directions say to soak 4-5 hours, so I soaked for 4 hours. For testing, I tried soaking the same brand of soybeans overnight, and the beans came out a bit too soft. So you may need to test to see how long you want to soak your beans.
To Prepare the Black Soybeans
Gently rinse the black soybeans (kuromame) under cold water a few times. The skin is very fragile, so try not to damage. Discard any beans that are damaged. Drain well.
Put the beans in the inner pot of Instant Pot. Add 4 cups of water to the pot and let them soak for 4 hours (or overnight, depending on your package instruction).
To make the black soybeans even darker, we cook the black soybeans with rusty iron nails in Japan (Read more in the blog post). If you use rusty iron nails, clean 2-3 nails, wrap in a cheesecloth and add in the pot. Optionally, you can purchase purchase “Lucky Iron Fish"" on Amazon and place it in the water.
To Cook the Black Soybeans in Instant Pot
After 4 hours of soaking, put the inner pot back to the Instant Pot (keep the iron fish in the pot). Add 1 cup sugar, 2 ½ tsp soy sauce, and ½ tsp kosher salt. Mix well.
Close the lid and set HIGH pressure for 15 minutes (It will take 10 minutes to pressurize). Make sure the steam release handle points at “sealing” and not “venting”. The float valve goes up when pressurized.
Once Pressure Cooking Is Done...
When it’s finished cooking, the Instant Pot will switch automatically to the “Keep Warm” mode. Let the pressure release naturally, about 45 minutes. Open the lid and take out the inner pot and remove the iron fish.
Pour the beans and sauce into a large airtight container. Let the beans cool uncovered.

Add the seasoned ground chicken into the broth.
Mix well and taste the broth. Adjust the taste with salt if necessary.
To make a slurry, in a small bowl, add potato starch/cornstarch and water and whisk well to combine.
Reduce the heat of the broth and gradually add the slurry to the broth and mix well to combine. If the sauce is too thick, add more water. If too watery, let the liquid evaporate a bit more (or you can make more slurry and add to the broth).

For this recipe, I use a 3-cup size double-lid donabe rice cooker called Kamado-san.
To Make Fish Broth
Note: The fish broth can be made a day ahead and refrigerated. With a spoon, remove the inside of the fish head. Keep the main fish bones for the broth, but discard any tiny bones, the fins, and the tail.
Place the fish bones and head in a medium/large pot and fill up the pot with water, just to cover them.
Bring the water to a boil over medium heat. Once boiling, skim the foam and scrum with a fine-mesh skimmer. Lower the heat and simmer for 10-15 minutes while skimming occasionally. We want clean broth for the rice.
After 10 minutes of simmering, strain the bones and broth over a fine-mesh strainer placed over a large bowl or another pot. Discard the bones and head, and let the broth cool to room temperature.
To Make Tai Meshi
Rinse the short-grain rice (If you are not sure how to rinse rice, see this post) and drain well. Transfer to a donabe (I use a Kamado-san) or a medium pot.
In a 2-cup measuring cup, add soy sauce and sake first. Then pour the fish broth until the amount is 400 ml (should be 1 ¾ cup minus 1 Tbsp).
Add salt and mix well together. Then transfer to the donabe (pot).
Flatten the rice and add a piece of kombu on top. Put the lid on (for Kamadosan, put internal and external lids). Let the rice soak in the broth for 20-30 minutes.
Cook on medium-high heat (or medium heat on a professional gas stove) for 13-15 minutes.
If you are using a Kamado-san, remove from the heat 2-3 minutes after the steam starts puffing from the top lid (see left pic below). Each gas stove is different, so this is a good sign to follow. Let it stand for 20 minutes, without opening the lid.
To Serve
Shave off the skin of ginger with a knife and cut it into thin slices. Then cut it into thin julienned pieces.
Break the fish meat into smaller bite-size pieces. If the fish was in the fridge, you may want to reheat it in the microwave. Open the lid (double lids, if using Kamado-san).
Remove the kombu (you can discard or re-use it to make simmered kombu) and gently fluff the rice with a rice paddle.
Add half of the fish meat and julienned ginger and mix gently. Then transfer the rest of the fish meat to the rice. Garnish with the rest of the ginger on top. Serve into individual bowls and sprinkle some sansho pepper if you like. Enjoy!

In a medium saucepan, bring 2 cups (480 ml) water to boil and add ½ tsp kosher salt.
Add green peas and cook for 4 minutes, or until the peas are firm but tender (eat one and you’ll see). Remove from the heat and let the peas cool in the cooking liquid. This will prevent from getting wrinkles.
Once the peas are cooled down, reserve 1 cup (240 ml) of cooking liquid.

Combine all the marinade ingredients in a small pot. Bring it to a boil, then simmer for 5 minutes. Remove the pot from the stove and let it cool.
Boil the eggs
Prepare a pot that is large enough to hold all the eggs without overlapping them. Add just enough water to cover the eggs. Heat over medium-high heat until boiling. Lower the heat to medium.
Transfer the eggs to a ladle or a colander. Slowly lower the eggs into the water to prevent them from cracking. Adjust the heat so the water maintains a slow boil.
Bring a small pot with just enough water to cover your 6 eggs to a boil.
(Optional) If you wish to keep the egg yolks in the center of the eggs, stir the water in a consistent circle for the first minute of cooking.
Cook for 6 minutes for runny yolks, 8 minutes for semi-firm, or 11 minutes for hard boiled.
While the eggs are boiling, prepare an ice bath (or a big bowl of cold water if you don’t have ice).
When the eggs are done cooking, run cold water over them for 30 seconds. Add the eggs to the ice bath and let them cool completely, about 10 minutes.
Marinate the eggs
Once the marinade is cooled until no longer hot to touch, transfer it into a tall container that is large enough to hold 8 cups of water (*Footnote 4).
Carefully crack the egg shells by tapping them with the back of a spoon or by gently rolling them on the counter. Starting from the bottom, begin peeling each egg, dipping it back into the water as needed to help loosen the shell. Make sure to peel off the egg membrane completely, so the egg will marinate evenly. Once peeled, place the eggs into the marinade container.
Marinate the eggs in the fridge for a minimum of 6 hours before serving. If you want to serve the eggs sooner, simply drizzle some extra marinade onto the cut eggs. Store the eggs in the marinade in the fridge for up to a week.
How to serve
You can serve the eggs over steamed rice or boiled noodles, drizzled with extra marinade and some homemade chili oil (if you wish). You can also make noodle soup by combining some marinade with hot noodle boiling water. Enjoy!",en-US,5.0,,Omnivore's Cookbook,390,6 serving(s),,2 g,6 g,5 g,1 g,212 mg,676 mg,1 g,1 serving,

At this point, the rice on the bottom will be moist and fragile. Use a rice paddle (or a fork) to gently fluff the rice by lifting from the bottom. Cover again and let rest for 10 to 20 minutes. This will redistribute the moisture and cook the rice more evenly.

Add the milk into a small bowl and warm to approximately 100-110°F (38°C), about 30 seconds in the microwave. The milk should be warm, just a bit above body temperature. Add a pinch of sugar and the active dry yeast. Let sit for 5 minutes so the yeast will activate.
While the yeast activates, add the rest of the ingredients into your mixer bowl.
Once the yeast is activated, you should see bubbles on the surface of the mixture. Pour it into the mixer bowl. Mix with a spatula until the dough just comes together. Cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 20 minutes.
Install the dough hook on your mixer (I used a KitchenAid). Start at low speed, then gradually increase to setting 8 out of 10. Knead for 10 to 12 minutes, until the dough is very smooth. Stop the mixer in the middle and scrape the dough from the sides of the bowl. Test the dough by pulling a piece of it using both of your hands. It should stretch into a very thin and translucent sheet. The dough should be wet and a bit sticky.
Grease a big bowl with a thin layer of oil. Place the dough into the bowl. Cover with plastic wrap. Let rise until the dough doubles in size, about 1 hour.
2nd rise
Line a 9” x 9” (23cm x 23 cm) baking pan with parchment paper.
Punch the air out of the dough. Transfer it onto a lightly oiled working surface. Divide the dough into 9 even pieces by cutting it into 3 even strips, then further cutting each strip into 3 small pieces. Each piece of dough should weigh 68 to 70 grams.
Shape the dough one piece at a time. Tuck the dough onto itself by pinching the dough from all sides into the center using your fingers, creating a round shape. Then roll the dough in a circular motion with your palm against the table, until it forms a round ball. Place the dough balls onto the parchment paper, evenly spaced, in a 3-by-3 array.
Cover the baking pan with plastic wrap. Let rest again for another 35 to 45 minutes, until the size has doubled.
Bake
Preheat the oven to 350° F (176° C) while resting the shaped bread rolls.
Right before baking, gently brush a thin layer of milk onto the tops of the bread rolls.
Bake the milk bread rolls on the middle rack for 20 to 25 minutes, until the top turns golden brown. You can also test the doneness by inserting an instant-read thermometer into the middle of the center bun. It should register at least 190°F.
Let the bread rest in the pan for 5 minutes, then transfer it onto a cooling rack.
Serve warm or at room temperature.
Store
Once the milk bread rolls have cooled completely, you can store them in an airtight container on your kitchen counter for up to 2 days. The rolls will stay very soft at room temperature. You can also warm them up in the microwave it for 10 seconds or leave them in a 350° F (176° C) oven to warm up before serving.

Add rice and water to cover into a large bowl. Use your fingers to gently rinse the rice in a swirling motion, then drain the water. Add water to cover the rice with 1” (2 cm) of water. Soak at room temperature overnight. Drain thoroughly before cooking.
Prep
Heat 1 cup of water in the microwave until hot. Add the dried shiitake mushrooms. Soak until the mushrooms turn soft, 15 to 20 minutes. Once done, squeeze the liquid out of the mushrooms into the soaking water. Slice the mushrooms thinly. Reserve the soaking water for cooking.
Cut the rest of the ingredients while rehydrating the mushrooms.
Cook
Heat the butter in a 4-quart dutch oven (or tight-sealing heavy pot) over medium heat. When the butter has melted, add the shallot and shiitake mushrooms. Cook, stirring frequently, until the onions turn golden and translucent, 6 to 8 minutes.
Add the Chinese sausage. Cook and stir for 1 minute.
Pour in the Shaoxing wine. Use your spatula to release any brown bits stuck on the bottom of the pan. Cook until the wine has evaporated completely.
Add the rice. Stir to mix the rice evenly with the other ingredients. Add the chicken stock and salt. Stir to mix well.
Add the water chestnuts. Pour in the soy sauce and dark soy sauce. Gently stir a few times to mix the soy sauce.
Cook until the liquid comes to a low simmer. Turn to very low heat and cover the dutch oven. Steam until the rice is cooked through, 20 to 25 minutes. Uncover the pan and taste the rice at the 20-minute mark. If the rice still has a bit of a raw texture, let it cook for another 5 minutes.
Once done, uncover the pan and stir with a rice paddle or spatula to fluff the rice. Garnish the stuffing with sliced green onions.
Serve hot as a side.
This dish can be cooked 1 to 2 days in advance. Reheat it in the same dutch oven in a 350 ℉ (176 ℃) oven with the lid on until warm. You can reheat it in the microwave, too. To heat it evenly, be sure to stir the rice several times over the course of reheating.
Clean-up
It’s very likely that the sticky rice will stick to the bottom of the pot once you’re done cooking. This is due to the starchy texture and the added soy sauce. To clean up the pot, add 2” (5 cm) of water to the pot and boil for 5 to 10 minutes, until the sticky rice can be lifted easily with a wooden spatula.

Combine the minced ginger and hot water in a small bowl. Stir to mix well and set aside.
Prepare the dough
In a large tall plate or a big bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, cornstarch, instant yeast and sugar. Stir to mix well.
Slowly pour in the warm water, a few tablespoons at a time, and mix with a pair of chopsticks (or a fork). Once all the water has been added, keep mixing and scrape off the dry flour on the side of the bowl, until it forms many small dough flakes.
Pour in the vegetable oil. Keep mixing with the chopsticks until the oil is absorbed.
Start kneading by hand while further incorporating the dry flour, until there’s no dry flour left in the bowl.
Transfer the dough onto a working surface. Knead for 15 to 20 minutes, until the dough is quite smooth and elastic and there’s no dry flour left in the bowl. It’s OK if there’s some unevenness in the dough, which will smooth out after resting. The dough should be quite tough and not sticky to the touch. Cover and seal the bowl with plastic wrap. Let rest until it doubles in size, 1 hour or so.
Prepare the filling
Add the ginger water, light and dark soy sauce, Shaoxing wine, salt, sugar, and white pepper to the ground pork in a large bowl. Beat with a pair of chopsticks or a wooden spatula in a circular motion, until all the liquid is absorbed and the meat is sticky. This process might take a few minutes. (*Footnote 4)
Add the green onions and sesame oil. Mix until they are incorporated. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Store in the fridge until ready to use.
Assemble the buns
When the dough has rested, transfer to a work surface and punch it down. Knead for 1 minute to deflate the air out completely, then form it back into a ball.
Cut the dough in half. Wrap half of the dough in plastic wrap and store in the fridge while working on the other half.
Poke a hole in the center of the dough you’re working with. Stretch the dough into a large oval by running your fingers along the inside of the hole in a circular motion. Once the diameter of the dough is about 1” (2.5 cm), tear apart the ring so it creates a long, thin strip.
Cut the dough strip into 12 even pieces by cutting it in half, then further cut each half into 6 pieces. Gently use a circular motion to round up each dough piece then flatten it with your palm. Cover them with plastic wrap to prevent drying out.
Work on one piece of dough at a time - take one dough piece and place in front of you. Roll it with a rolling pin in one hand, using the other hand to rotate the dough while rolling, until the diameter reaches 5” (13 cm). You should keep the edges thinner than the center, so the wrapper of the bun will be even once you make the pleats.
Place the rolled dough in your palm and add 1 tablespoon of filling in the center.
Start wrapping the bun by folding and pinching the edge over itself, in one direction, until it is almost sealed. Then rotate and pinch the top of the pleats to fully seal the bun. (View my video for more details)
Repeat with the remaining dough pieces to wrap all the buns. Keep the wrapped buns under a piece of plastic wrap to prevent drying out. Once done wrapping, let rest for 10 minutes. Once rested, you should cook the buns immediately. You can store the wrapped buns in a sealed container in the fridge for up to 1 hour before cooking.
Repeat the wrapping steps to wrap the other half of the dough.
To cook the buns:
Add 2 tablespoons of oil and carefully place 12 wrapped buns into a 9” or 10” skillet. Heat over medium-high heat until hot. Turn to medium heat. Cook, uncovered, for 3 minutes, until the bottoms are lightly browned.
Pour about 1/4 cup hot water into the pan, just enough to cover the buns halfway up. Cover the pan and cook over medium heat for about 8 minutes, until the water is completely evaporated.
Turn the heat to medium-low and cook for another 2 to 3 minutes. Turn the heat off and remove the pan from the stove. Let the buns rest with the lid on for an additional 2 minutes. Remove the lid and transfer to a plate. Repeat the steps to cook the rest of the buns.

Use your fingers to gently rinse the rice in a circular motion a few times, then drain off the water. Repeat 1 to 2 times.
Instant Pot Method
Add the rice and water to your Instant Pot. Cover and seal the lid. Select high pressure, and set the timer to 25 minutes. Once done, let the pressure release naturally.
Once the pressure has fully released, open the lid and stir the congee with a ladle. It might look thin once it’s done cooking, but it will thicken up a bit once you stir it well and let it sit for a few minutes. If you want to change the texture of the congee, turn on the “Saute” function and let it boil down for a few minutes and stir constantly, until it turns thicker. Or you can pour in a bit of hot water and stir it, to thin it out.
Stovetop Method
Add the rinsed rice and water to a medium-sized or big, tall pot. Bring to a boil over high heat. Stir a few times to make sure the rice doesn’t stick to the bottom.
Turn to medium-low or medium heat to reduce to a simmer. Cover the pot halfway to keep the water boiling without spilling over. Simmer for 45 to 50 minutes, depending on the texture you’re looking for. Stir the congee a few times during cooking. Towards the end of cooking, the congee will get quite thick and sticky. Stay near the pot and stir frequently over the last 10 to 15 minutes. It will easily spill if covered too much or if the heat is too high. The rice will stick to the bottom if you don’t stir enough.
Serve
Serve the congee hot or warm with any topping options you prefer. You can also replace steamed rice with the congee as a side, to serve with other dishes.
Store and reheat
You can store the congee in a sealed container in the fridge for 3 to 4 days. The congee will continue to thicken. To dilute it, you can add a splash of water to the congee and heat it either on the stovetop or in the microwave.",en-US,-1.0,,Omnivore's Cookbook,123,4 serving(s),84 kcal,18.5 g,1.7 g,0.2 g,,,10 mg,,1 serving,0.3 g

Make the dough by hand - Put the flour in a large bowl, add dry yeast, and mix well with a fork. Add water and mix with a fork or a pair of chopsticks, stirring in a clockwise direction, until water is fully incorporated with flour. Dust both hands with flour and start by using one hand to knead until dough begins to form. The dough should be soft, but shouldn’t stick to the bottom of the bowl. Blend in more flour if the dough sticks to the hands, 1 teaspoon at a time. Dust a cutting board or working surface with flour and transfer the dough onto the cutting board. Continue kneading the dough for a few minutes, until the surface becomes smooth.
Make the dough using a food processor or mixer - Add the flour and the yeast into the food processor (or mixer), pulse a few times to mix well. Add the water and mix until it forms a dough. Transfer the dough onto a dusted working surface. Knead for a few minutes until the surface becomes smooth.
Make the dough using a Kitchenaid - Add the flour and the yeast into the Kitchenaid bowl. Mix on low for a few revolutions. Gradually add the water. Mix until it forms a smooth dough, 10 minutes or so.
Making the bread
Transfer the dough to a dusted bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Rest the dough for 10 to 15 minutes (*Footnote 1).
Dust both hands again and knead the dough a few times. Divide the dough into 10 equal parts, and shape each one into a ball by hand. Transfer the dough onto a dusted tray and cover with plastic wrap. Let rest for another 10 minutes.
Dust both hands and the working surface. Place one dough ball on the working surface, then press it with the palm into a round shape. Use a rolling pin to flatten the dough into a 1/4 inch (6-mm) thick round disk. Set aside. Shape the rest of the dough balls the same way.
Heat a cast iron pan or nonstick skillet with a few drops of oil over medium heat. When skillet is hot, turn to medium low heat. Place a round piece of dough into the skillet and cover the pan (cook one or two doughs at a time, depending on the size of the skillet). Use a spatula to turn the dough occasionally, 1 to 2 minutes per side, and cook covered during the process, until both sides turn golden brown and the bread is inflated. Transfer finished buns to a plate or cooling rack.
When the buns have cooled down a bit, use a knife to split them horizontally, half-way through. Separate the inside of the bun with your fingers, taking care not to tear the two layers apart.

Combine the flour, yeast, baking powder, sugar, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer. Slowly pour in the milk while using a spoon or spatula to mix with the flour. Once the liquid is fully combined, turn on the mixer and knead for 5 minutes until it forms a firm and coarse dough ball. Alternatively, you can use your hands to knead the dough and it should take about 10 minutes.
Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the dough rest for 10 minutes.
After 10 minutes, knead the dough using your hands, for another minute, until smooth. Cover with plastic wrap. Rest the dough until it doubles in size, about 1 hour.
While the dough is rising, prepare 10 pieces of square parchment paper about the size of your palm, to hold the buns while steaming.
(Optional) If you’re making the gua bao filling and quick pickled shallots on the same day, prepare them during this time.
Divide the dough
Once the dough has doubled in size, punch the dough gently with your hand to release the air bubbles. Knead for 1 minute.
Cut the dough into 2 equal pieces, then further divide each piece into 5 smaller pieces. For a more accurate result, use a scale to measure the dough to make sure it’s 48 g per piece.
Work on the dough pieces one at a time, forming them into balls by pinching the loose ends into the base until taut and round. Then roll the dough on the table using your hand shaped like a dome, lightly pressing the dough so it forms a round ball. Place the dough balls on a large plate and cover them with plastic wrap to prevent them from drying out.
Shape the buns & 2nd rise
Place the dough balls pinched side down onto a clean working surface. Using a rolling pin, roll each ball into a 1/4"" (1/2 cm) thick oval that's twice as long as it is wide (about 2.25” x 4.5”/ 5.5 cm X 11 cm). Flip the dough oval over and lightly roll again to smooth it out,
Brush the top of the dough oval with a thin layer of oil (*Footnote 1), fold the oval in half, and place it on a piece of parchment paper you prepared earlier.
Place the shaped buns in a steamer basket, leaving at least 1” (2.5 cm) between the buns. Cover and let rise for another 15 to 30 minutes before cooking, or until the size is 1.5 times bigger.
Cook the buns
Right after you finish forming the first batch of buns, prepare the steamer by adding water into the base. When the buns have risen the 2nd time, add the covered steamer rack with the risen buns over the steamer. If using a metal steamer, use two layers of clean kitchen towels between the steamer rack and the lid to prevent water from dripping. Cook covered over medium heat until steam starts coming out of the pot, then turn to medium-low heat. Steam for another 10 minutes.
After 10 minutes, turn the heat off but leave the lid on for another 5 minutes. Do not open the lid at this time! The buns might deflate without the proper resting.
Once done, remove the buns onto a wire rack to cool. Then you can use the same steamer to cook the rest of your buns.
Workflow note
You probably will need to cook the buns in batches depending on the size of your steamer. While you’re steaming the first batch of the buns, the second batch or the third batch might have been formed and rested. In this case, transfer the buns onto a big plate and cover them with plastic wrap. Transfer the buns into the fridge to slow down the rising. Wait until the previous batch of buns is done. Remove the rested buns from the fridge, let them return to room temperature for 2 minutes, then start steaming them. It’s important to NOT allow the buns to rise too much. If the buns are rested for too long, they will deflate once steamed.
Serve, store & reheat
Once the buns are steamed and slightly cooled, you can use them to make gua bao, serve them with moo shu chicken, or stuff them with any braised meat.
You can store the steamed buns in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 4 days, or in a tightly sealed ziplock bag in the freezer for up to 3 months.
To reheat the refrigerated buns, you can place the buns on a plate and cover them with a layer of wet paper towels, then heat them up in the microwave. You can also heat the buns in a steamer, which will create a softer result.
To reheat the frozen buns, place them directly in a steamer without thawing them and steam until fully heated through.

Gather all the ingredients.
Carefully wash the sweet potatoes (Don’t peel the skin). Cut the sweet potatoes diagonally while rotating the sweet potato a quarter between cuts. This Japanese cutting technique is called “Rangiri”.
Put the sweet potatoes in 8 cups water and add 2 tsp salt. Soak for 15 minutes to remove starch.
Add the oil in the medium pot (I use a 2.75-QT Staub) and bring it to 320ºF (160ºC) (Use a cooking thermometer helps!). Meanwhile, dry the sweet potatoes with the kitchen towel (or paper towel).
When the oil has reached 320ºF (160ºC), add the sweet potatoes (half of them) into the oil and deep fry. Do not crowd the pot and fry in batches (I do twice).
Deep fry until golden brown, about 10 minutes.
When it's golden brown, insert a wooden skewer to make sure it goes through. Transfer to a wire rack or a paper towel to drain the oil.
To make candy (syrup), combine 5 Tbsp sugar, 1 ½ Tbsp water, and 1 Tbsp Mirin in a large frying pan off the heat. Put on the stove and bring it to boil on medium heat.
Once the mixture is bubbling, add 1 tsp vinegar and 1 tsp soy sauce.
Reduce the mixture, stirring constantly, until the right consistency. When you can draw a line on the pan, add the sweet potatoes.
Turn off the heat and coat the sweet potatoes with syrup. Sprinkle black sesame seeds (once the candy is hardened, sesame seeds won't stick to the surface, so do it while candy is soft).
Serve on a plate or bowl. Enjoy!
#2 Steam & Shallow-Fry Version
Gather all the ingredients.
Carefully wash the sweet potatoes (Don’t peel the skin).
Cut the sweet potatoes diagonally while rotating the sweet potato a quarter between cuts. This Japanese cutting technique is called “Rangiri”.
Soak sweet potatoes in water for 15 minutes to remove starch.
Do not heat the frying pan yet. Add sugar, oil, soy sauce and rice vinegar in the pan and combine all together.
Dry the sweet potatoes completely with paper towel and place in the pan.
Wrap the frying pan’s lid with kitchen cloth. This is to prevent condensation on the lid dripping into sweet potatoes while cooking.
Cover with the lid and turn on the heat to medium.
When you hear bubbling sound from the pan, turn the heat to low to medium-low, and set timer for 2 minutes. Open the lid and flip the sweet potatoes every 2-3 minute so that all sides will have nice golden brown color and get flavored.
Depends on the size of sweet potatoes, the cooking time varies, cook for 8-10 minutes or until an inserted skewer goes through smoothly (I personally prefer it a bit tougher than completely soft texture).

Knead on a lightly floured surface for about 3 minutes, until a smooth dough forms. In Japan, we say “knead until the texture is like your earlobe”.
Form the dough into a ball, put it back in the bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let it rest at room temperature for at least 30 minutes or longer. Letting the dough rest increases its elasticity making it easier to work with later, so please don't skip.
To Make Eggplant Filling
While the dough rests, make the fillings. Remove the eggplant stem and cut it half vertically. Then slice into half circles. Soak in water for 5-10 minutes (Meanwhile, you can cut Kabocha). Drain well and set aside.
Heat sesame oil in a large frying pan and sauté eggplant until it is coated with oil. Cover the lid and cook on low heat for 5 minutes.
When tender, add sugar and combine well.
Add miso and julienned shiso leaves, and mix well together. Transfer to a dish to let cool.
To Make Kabocha Filling
Cut the kabocha into smaller wedges and remove the skin (See How To Cut a Kabocha Squash).
Cut each wedge into thin slices and then cut into thin strips.
Heat the oil in the frying pan and sauté the kabocha. When it’s coated with oil, add water and cook covered for 5 minutes on low heat.
Add sugar and combine well.
Add soy sauce and pinch of salt. Mix well together.
Transfer to the dish to let cool.
To Shape into Oyaki
Roll out the rested dough into a rectangular or circle shape and divide it into 12 pieces.
Make each dough into a ball then press down with your hand.
Stretch the dough to 10 cm (4 inches) in diameter. The important trick is to keep the center thicker than the edges. Using your fingers, stretch the outer edges by rotating the dough. This way, when you pinch the dough to seal, the dough won’t be too thick/too much.
Place about 1 Tbsp of the filling in the center of each piece of dough. Close the oyaki by bringing the dough up over the filling, pinching at the top to seal.
I use the same pleating technique as my Nikuman recipe (see the video on how I close the dough and pinch).
After pinching the dough, put the pinched-side down on a lightly floured surface and twist a few times. Then press the top of the oyaki a little bit into a slightly flat ball.
To Cook Oyaki
Set a steamer ready, by placing a steamer basket on top of wok/pot filled with enough boiling water. If you don’t have a steamer, after cooking the oyaki in a frying pan, add ¼ cup water to the pan. Cover with a lid and steam it until the water evaporates.
Heat the oil in a frying pan (12 inch) and cook oyaki, pinched-side down.
Pan fry for 3-4 minutes each side, or until golden brown.
Transfer the oyaki to a steamer basket and cover to cook on high heat for 15-20 minutes (depending on the size of the oyaki and filling – small one should take about 10 minutes). Make sure the lid is covered with the kitchen towel so condensation on the lid doesn’t fall onto the oyaki.
When they are done steaming, transfer to a wire rack (I use a bamboo strainer) where the heat can escape from the bottom.

To Prepare Fruits
Remove the core of strawberries.
Cut off both ends and peel the skin of the kiwis.
Cut off both ends of the navel orange. Remove the peel. Carefully peel off the segment wall and get each segment out.
Using a paper towel, remove the moisture of the fruits.
To Make Whipped Cream
Prepare a large bowl of iced water and place a medium bowl inside the larger bowl to keep cool. Make sure the bowl is clean and dry. Add the heavy whipping cream and start whisking on low speed.
Once bubbly, add sugar and rum (if you are using) and start whisking on medium-high speed.
The cream will be thicker as you whip.
When you lift the whisk out of the cream and shows peaks, remove the bowl from the ice bath and switch to a hand whisk. Whisk until you achieve the right consistency. Check the consistency of the whipped cream as you whisk. It should be spreadable but not runny because it goes between the sandwich bread.
Now spread the whipped cream on both sides of the sandwich bread. If there is any leftover whipped cream, you can dip your fruits or make Fruit Parfait. I prefer to keep the crust on the bread until the end. When you put fruits between two slices of the bread, the crust helps to keep it in shape.
Only on one side of the sandwich bread, align the fruits. I plan to cut the sandwich diagonally. Think carefully about how you want to show your cross section. I recommend taking a picture of the alignment of the fruits and don’t change the orientation of the sandwich.
Put the whipped cream to fill in any gap between fruits.
Put the second slices of sandwich bread over the fruits, facing the whipped cream side down.
Prepare plastic wrap, large enough to wrap the sandwich tightly from all four sides. Remember, don’t change the orientation of the sandwich.
Mark the cross section over the plastic wrap with a pen.
Put the sandwiches between plates and refrigerate for at least one hour (up to overnight). In Japan, putting weight on the sandwich is a pretty standard method prior to cutting in half.
Open the plastic wrap and cut the sandwich in half diagonally with a clean knife. Keep it closed (Don’t open the sandwich to show cross section yet). Clean the knife with a hot wet towel before each cut.
Gently press down the sandwich and cut off the 4 edges.
Now the cross section is revealed for the first time!
Serve immediately. If you plan to transfer the sandwich, make sure to keep it chilled all times.

To Dry Mochi (7-10 Days Before Frying)
Cut kirimochi into small pieces and ⅛ inch (3 mm) thickness. Lay the mochi pieces in a single layer on a flat tray or wire rack.
Allow them to air dry with good ventilation for at least one week. As mochi pieces dehydrate, they might break into smaller pieces so try not to touch. The surface of mochi pieces will be cracked and flaky and the texture will be harder.
Another option: I haven't tried this method, but I've read that you can alternatively bake the mochi pieces at 400ºF (200ºF) for 15 mins. For a convection oven, reduce cooking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC). You can lightly brush oil and season with salt (so the salt will stick to the rice crackers).
To Cook Rice Crackers
In a frying pan (I use a cast-iron skillet), add the oil to about ¾ inch (2 cm) deep and heat it to 340ºF (170ºC). Add a few pieces of mochi pieces first. If small bubbles start to appear around the mochi, then add more pieces in a single layer, keeping some space in between as they pop and expand. The mochi pieces will turn white and puff up.
Turn over each piece and cook until mochi pieces are popped and lightly golden brown. Increase heat so the oil is 350ºF (180ºC) and fry till mochi pieces are golden brown.
Remove the mochi pieces from the oil and place a wire rack or a plate lined with paper towels. While they are hot, season with salt.
Optionally, you can sprinkle furikake or brush soy sauce (adjust the amount of salt if you use soy sauce).

To Prepare Fillings
Grind ¼ cup katsuobushi (bonito flakes) into a fine powder. Set aside, we'll use this powder when we're cooking Takoyaki.
Cut green onions into fine slices and mince 1 Tbsp red pickled ginger.
Cut the octopus into ½ inch (1.3 cm) bite-size pieces (cut into smaller pieces for kids so they can chew easily). I use ""rangiri"" cutting technique.
To Make Takoyaki Batter
In a large mixing bowl, combine 1 cup (120 g) all-purpose flour, 2 tsp baking powder, and ½ tsp kosher salt and whisk all together.
Add 2 large eggs, 1 tsp soy sauce, and 1 ½ cup (360 ml) dashi.
Whisk all together until well-blended and transfer the batter to a 2-cup measuring cup with a handle (or any other pitcher with a spout for easy pouring).
To Cook Takoyaki
Heat the takoyaki pan to 400ºF (200ºC) over medium heat. Using a brush, generously oil the takoyaki pan (both the holes and connecting flat areas). When you see smoke coming from the pan, pour the batter to fill the holes. It’s okay for the batter to slightly overflow the holes. Usually, as you add ingredients to the batter it will overflow.
Add 1-3 octopus pieces in each hole depending on its size and sprinkle katsuobushi powder you ground earlier on top.
Then sprinkle tenkasu, green onion, and pickled red ginger.
After 3 minutes or so, when the bottom of the balls has hardened slightly, break the connected batter between each ball with skewers. Then turn each piece 90 degrees, stuffing in the edges as you are turning. The batter will flow out from the inside of each takoyaki ball and creates the other side of the takoyaki ball. After you finish flipping, set the timer for 4 minutes. Keep turning constantly so each piece will have a nice round shape. Home takoyaki grill doesn’t equally distribute heat so it’s a good idea to swap takoyaki balls around to get even brown color.
To Serve
Transfer takoyaki balls onto a plate and pour takoyaki sauce, mayonnaise. Finish off with sprinkling katsuobushi and dried green seaweed. Serve immediately (but be careful – inside is VERY hot!).

Put 10.6 oz flour, scant 2 Tbsp sugar, ½ tsp salt, 1 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp instant dry yeast, and 1 Tbsp oil in a large bowl. While mixing the mixture with chopsticks or a wooden spoon, slowly pour 160-170 ml water into the mixture and mix until incorporated.
Lightly dust your hand with flour to keep the dough from sticking too much. Use your hand to knead the dough, pressing it down and reshaping it. Form it into a ball.
Sprinkle the working surface with flour. Transfer the dough onto the surface and start kneading. This is how I knead. First, press the top half of the dough, pushing forward slightly. Then pull it back and fold it in half and press it forward again with the heel of your hand twice. Then turn the dough slightly and repeat this process for 10-15 minutes or until the dough becomes smooth and silky. Sprinkle the dough with a little bit of flour at a time to help decrease the stickiness.
Form the dough into a smooth, round shape, gently tucking loose ends underneath. Coat the bottom of the bowl with oil and place the dough in the bowl. Cover it with plastic wrap and put it in a warm place until the dough doubles in size, about 30-60 minutes.
While you’re waiting for the dough to rise, make the filling. First, soak the dried shiitake mushrooms in ½ cup water. Place something heavy on top so the whole shiitake will be submerged. Set aside for 10-15 minutes.
Thinly slice the scallion. Remove the tough core of the cabbage and chop into 1” (2.5 cm) pieces.
Sprinkle the chopped cabbage with 1 tsp salt to draw out excess water.
Once shiitake mushrooms are hydrated, squeeze the liquid out, cut off the tough stem, and mince the mushroom tops.
In a large bowl, combine ground pork, scallion, and shiitake mushrooms. Squeeze the excess water out from the cabbage with your hands and add it into the bowl.
Grate ginger and add all the seasonings (1 tsp sugar, 1 Tbsp sake, 1 Tbsp soy sauce, 1 Tbsp sesame oil, 1 Tbsp potato/corn starch, and freshly ground black pepper).
Knead the mixture well until it is well combined and looks pale and sticky. Set aside (or cover with plastic wrap and keep in the fridge) until the dough is ready.
Once the dough has doubled in size, dust the working surface with flour and divide the dough in half and then roll each piece of dough into a log. Cut each log into 5 even pieces and then cut each piece in half. You can divide into fewer pieces of dough to make bigger buns. It's also easier to work with smaller dough to make nice pleats when you wrap because it's hard to hold a big dough and filling in one hand. Form each piece of dough into a ball and dust the dough balls with flour to avoid sticking to each other. Space each ball apart and cover loosely with a damp kitchen cloth to avoid drying out. Let them rest for 10 minutes.
Take a ball of dough and flatten it with your palm. Then roll it with a rolling pin into a round sheet. Here’s how I roll the dough. Hold the top of the dough with the left hand and use a rolling pin to roll out the dough with the right hand. You only need to roll up and down on the bottom half of the dough. After rolling 1-2 times, rotate the dough about 30 degrees with the left hand. Repeat this process until the dough becomes thin. The center of dough should be thicker than the edge.
Scoop 1 ½ Tbsp of filling (I use this 1 ½ Tbsp cookie scoop) and place in the center of the dough.
Hold the dough with the left hand and seal the bun using the right index finger and thumb. First, pick up a corner of the dough with your right index finger and thumb and pinch together (left picture). Without moving your thumb, use your right index finger to pick up the dough and pinch it with your thumb while rotating the dough clockwise with your left hand (right picture).
Repeat this process about 10-12 times (= 10-12 pleats) until you seal the last part of the dough by pinching it tightly. Here are some tips: your left thumb should hold down the filling and use your left fingers to turn around the wrapper. Use your left index finger to help to pleat. Also, lift up the pinched pleats slightly while you make the new pleat so the filling stays inside the dough.
Once you finish sealing the last part of the dough, twist the pleats further with your right index finger and thumb to maintain a tight seal. If you’re left-handed, reverse the directions.
Easy Alternative Option: Wrap the filling by bringing the dough up around the meat to the top, forming little pleats with the excess dough, then slightly twisting the dough to close it and pinching it firmly to join the edges.
Place the bun on a piece of parchment paper that fits the bun (for small size, 3” x 3”). Cover the finished buns with plastic wrap and repeat this process with the rest of the dough. Let the buns rest for 20 minutes.
Bring water to boil and set a steamer. Once the water is boiling, place the buns and parchment paper in the steamer tray leaving about 2” between each bun (buns will get larger while being steamed). Close the lid and steam over high heat for 10 minutes (10 for small buns, 13 for medium, 15 for big). If you use a regular pot for steaming, wrap the lid with a kitchen cloth to prevent the condensation (formed on the lid) from dripping onto the buns. Enjoy immediately.

Open the lid and add 1 tsp truffle and salt and the remaining popcorn kernels.
Cover the pot with the lid and gently shake the pot from side to side (or back and forth). This will distribute the popcorns in an even layer and mix the truffle and salt with the kernels.
While the kernels pop, shake the pot occasionally over the burner to prevent the kernels from burning. When you are not shaking the pot, keep the lid slightly ajar to release the steam from the popcorn. Cook until there are about 2-3 seconds between pops. By this time, you can’t hear many kernels moving against the bottom of the pan.
Remove from the heat. Shake a few times to let the last few kernels pop and take the lid off to let the steam out, this will allow the popcorns to stay crisp. Enjoy!

In a large bowl, combine 1 large egg and ⅓ cup black sugar, and whisk together until sugar has dissolved.
Add 1 tsp oil and whisk together.
Sift 1 cup cake flour, 1 tsp baking powder, and ⅛ tsp kosher salt over the egg and sugar mixture.
Using a silicone spatula, start to combine the dry and wet ingredients. If the dough is too wet, you can add extra flour. Moisture in the air effects, so you have to decide how your dough is like. If you feel that it’s too soft and wet, add more flour 1 Tbsp at a time. The consistency is similar to cookie dough, but slightly softer. Let the dough rest for an hour.
Bring the oil in the deep fryer to 300-320ºF (150-160ºC) over medium-low heat. In order to cook inside the dough, we deep fry at low temperature. For a medium saucepan, you will need about 3 cups of oil. You can use less oil, but you will need to rotate the balls often as they won’t be covered by oil.
Prepare some oil (for rolling the dough) in a small bowl and rub it on your palms which will prevent the dough from sticking to your hands.
When the oil in the deep fryer reaches 300-320ºF (150-160ºC), scoop the dough with a cookie scooper and roll into a ball. To achieve the same portion size for whatever you're making, a cookie scooper is a great tool to have. The size should be slightly bigger than 1 inch (should be around 3 cm). We say the size should be Ping-Pong ball size (if that helps).
As soon as you are done with rolling, start putting the dough balls into the oil. They will expand so do not put too many.
Once the dough balls are cooked through, they start to float. They rotate themselves, but you can help them rotate to achieve even coloring.
When golden brown, about 7-8 minutes of deep frying, pick them up and drain excess oil on a paper towel or wire rack. Let cool for 5 minutes and enjoy!
