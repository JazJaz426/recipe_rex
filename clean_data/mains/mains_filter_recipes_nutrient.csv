Pour the marinade over the chicken and refrigerate at least one hour. You can go up to 8 hours. There is no acid in the marinade so there's no issue with the chicken cooking (think ceviche). Reserve the marinade when you are done marinating the chicken. Don't throw it out. This is important.
Pre-heat your oven to 375F.
Remove the chicken from the marinade and place into a dish that can go from the oven to the stove-top. You don't want a pan that is much bigger than the chicken. A frying pan with heat resistant handles is great for this.
Roast until the internal temperature of the chicken reaches 160F. Remove the chicken from the pan and set aside.
Place the frying pan (or whatever you are using) over medium heat. When it starts to bubble stir up any browned bits in the pan. Add the reserved marinade and bring to a lively simmer. This kills any bacteria so make sure you see bubbles in the pan.
If your sauce seems dry add a little drizzle of chicken stock. You don't get a lot of sauce here. It's just a drizzle so don't go crazy.

Combine the soy, sake, mirin, sugar, garlic and green onions in a ziploc bag large enough to hold the pork belly. Stick a straw in the bag and seal the ziploc bag up against it (so the straw is the only opening). Suck as much of the air out as you can and seal.
Sous vide the pork for 10-11 hours at 170F.
Remove pork from the ziploc bag. Discard the bag and marinade.
Let the chashu pork belly cool completely.
Slice across the chashu pork (so you get bacon like slices) - into 8-12 slices about 1/8 to 3/16 inches thick. Reserve. You won't need all the pork for 4 servings.
Soy bacon tare
Combine all the ingredients in a small sauce pan. Simmer at the lowest setting for about an hour. Top up with a bit of chicken stock if needed.
Remove the bacon.
Miso tare
Combine all ingredients in a small sauce pan and simmer at the lowest setting for about 5 minutes.
Medium boiled eggs
Bring enough water to cover the eggs to a boil. If you have a way to prick the eggshell do it. Boil large eggs for 6 minutes 30 seconds. If using extra large eggs boil them for 7 minutes 30 seconds. You may have to adjust your times slightly depending on the exact size of your eggs but this should get you pretty close.
Submerge the eggs in cold or ice water to chill. This stops the egg yolks from continuing to set up. Peel. Cut in half right before you serve your tonkotsu ramen.
Assemble the tonkotsu ramen
Boil the ramen noodles in plenty of water as directed by the packaging. If there's no translation on the packaging usually its 4 minutes. You don't need to salt the water.
Cook the mushrooms along side the noodles - you just want them softened.
Gently fry the chashu pork in a non-stick skillet until lightly browned.
Place 1/4 of whichever tare you are using in the bottom of four bowls.

Slice the onion into 1/8 inch slices. Cut the onion in half from the stem to the root. Peel. Cut the stem end off. Now cut slices moving towards the stem end. You are cutting onion half moons.
Cut up the carrots, potatoes and chicken. You want bite size pieces.
Heat a pot large enough to hold all the ingredients over medium low heat. Add 2 tablespoons of butter. Let melt and then add the onions and the salt. Cook the onions for about 5 minutes stirring occasionally. You are going for soft and translucent. You don't want to let the onions brown.
Add the carrots, garlic and ginger (or 1 tbsp of garlic ginger paste if you stock it) and cook another 2 minutes.
Add the stock. Stir and bring to a simmer. Let cook 10 minutes. Set a timer. Makes things easy.
Add the potatoes. Cook another 15 minutes. Use your timer. Check the potatoes. They should be close to done. Depends on how big the pieces were. If they aren't starting to soften cook them until they do.
Add the chicken. Cook 10 minutes.
While the chicken cooks make the curry roux.
Heat the remaining 4 tablespoons of butter in a small sauce pan over medium low heat. Add the curry powder and garam masala and cook for about 30-45 seconds. Add the flour and stir to combine. You want all the flour coated with fat. If it's really dry add a bit of vegetable oil.
Cook the flour/spice mixture over medium low heat for about 2 minutes. This is your roux.
Now add a couple tablespoons of broth from the simmering curry. Stir to combine. It will make an ungodly looking mess. Goop. Don't worry. Add another couple tablespoons of broth and stir. Repeat that a couple more times.
Now add around 1/2 cup of broth and stir to combine. Add another 1/2 cup or so and stir. You sould be getting to the point where you have a really thick but smooth paste. Curry paste. It's better than it sounds. It's actually a variant of veloute which is a variant on bechamel. There's some cooking theory in this recipe...
10-12 minutes have gone by. Check the chicken. It should be done or at least close. Depends on how lively your simmer is though. Use an instant read thermometer. Safety first. You want it read around 155-160F at this point. The thighs are cooked at 170F but you can go a little higher. That's the nice thing about dark meat. It is forgiving.
Add the curry veloute (fancy way to say the curry paste) to the curry. Stir to combine. Bring to a simmer. The chicken should be done. Check it. If it's not cook it for another few minutes.
Taste. At this point the flavour profile will be similar to the cubes. Adjust salt. Now add one tablespoon of tonkotsu sauce. Taste again. This will add a hint of sweetness as well as that secret Japanese curry flavour. If you like it stop now. If you want more fruit and sugar add another tablespoon. I like it between one and two tablespoons. If you want big fruit taste add another tablespoon. I've never gone beyond that so I don't know if more is better.

You are going for large bite sized pieces.
Mix the sake, soy, mirin, salt, ginger and garlic in with the chicken. Let sit 15-20 minutes minimum. Up to an hour is OK.
Individually dust the chicken pieces with the potato starch. Don't go overboard. Don't double dredge. It will be tough. You really want a light hand here. Set chicken on a rack on a cookie sheet until you are ready to fry.
Pre-heat the oil in a heavy frying pan. A nice large cast iron pan works well here. Go for about 1 inch of oil in the pan. Use a candy thermometer. You want your oil at 340-350F when the chicken goes in. Regulate your heat to try to keep it in the range while the chicken cooks if you can.
A word of caution here. Don't add a bunch of chicken at the same time. You run the risk of the oil bubbling up over the edge of your pan. That's really bad. Dangerous. Be careful. Cook smart.
Working in batches, deep fry the chicken until it reaches an internal temperature of 170F. Get an instant read thermometer if you don't have one. Instant read thermometers are how you get consistent results.
Once the first batch of chicken is done, set it on paper towels on a plate. Repeat until all the chicken is cooked.

Pre-heat your oven to 375F. Put an ovenproof skillet large enough to hold the chicken in the oven to pre-heat.
Medium boiled eggs
Gently lower the eggs into the boiling water (the water for the noodles) and cook for 6 1/2 minutes for large eggs. 7 1/2 minutes for extra large eggs.
After 6 1/2 (or 7 1/2 depending on the size of the eggs) minutes place the eggs in a bowl of ice water to cool. You want them to cool quickly to stop the yolks from hardening.
Peel the eggs and set aside.
Cook the chicken
Rub the chicken with a bit of vegetable oil and season with salt.
Remove the skillet from the oven. Be careful. The handle is hot. Putting a bar towel on the handle to remind you is never a bad idea. This is one burn you can live without.
Place the chicken, skin side up, in the skillet and return to the oven.
Cook until the chicken reaches an internal temperature of about 170F. This takes 12-15 minutes. Remember - that handle is hot.
Flip the chicken so the skin side is down and place the pan over medium heat. Fry about a minute. You just want the skin to crisp up and turn golden. Remove the chicken from the pan and tent with foil. Set aside.
Spoon off the fat. Leave the darker liquid and any fond in the pan. That stuff is serious flavour.
Make the broth
Deglaze the pan with a bit of chicken stock. Scrape up any those little bits in the bottom of the pan. Add about two cups of stock. Bring to a simmer.
Place the cubes in the stock, remove from the heat and cover. Let it sit for 5 minutes.
Uncover and look. The cubes should be melted at this point. Stir them into the stock. It isn't easy to get the curry cubes fully melted and smooth. You will likely have to chase little bits around your pot. I've tried all sorts of approaches. This is the best I've figured out so far but it isn't perfect.
Add the remaining stock and simmer for about 4-5 minutes.
While the stock simmers cook the ramen noodles per the instructions on the package.
Drain the noodles.
To serve
Slice each egg in half lengthwise. Be careful. The yolks still have a bit of runny texture.
Divide the noodles across two bowls. Ladle the broth into the bowls. Arrange the chicken overtop the noodles and pour half the broth into each bowl. Add the eggs, submerging slightly to warm them through.

Salt the steaks liberally.
Use a food saver to shrink wrap the steaks.
Pre-heat your sous vide to 116 degrees. See below for guidelines on temperature vs. level of doneness.
Immerse the shrink wrapped steaks in the water and let it cook for about 90-110 minutes.
Remove the steaks from the water bath.
Heat a sturdy skillet large enough to hold the steak in a single layer over medium high heat.
Add about 1 Tbsp of vegetable or peanut oil.
Sprinkle the steaks with black pepper to taste. A nice crust of butcher's grind pepper is nice. Not particularly Japanese but nice.
Sear the steaks one one side for about 20 seconds. Flip and cook on the other side for 20 seconds. Repeat on each side for a total of about 80 seconds.
Sear the sides (stand the steaks up) about 20 seconds on each of the long sides.
Let rest 5 minutes.
Make the simple ponzu sauce
Combine the sake and mirin in a small sauce pan and simmer for 1 minute.
Add the remaining ingredients and stir.
Prep the green onions
Here's a trick that food bloggers don't advertise. If you want those nifty curled green onions it's easy.
Julienne the green part of a couple green onions.
Immerse the julienned green onion in a small bowl of ice and water.
Stir them around a bit with your finger to get them unstuck from each other.
Let stand about 20 minutes.
Drain and blot on paper towel.
That's it. Now you know.
Serve the beef tataki
Slice the beef thinly. Try to get as close to across the grain as you can. If you have a nice Japanese knife this is a good place to use it.
Fan the beef out. Garnish with thin slices of the white portion of a green onion along with the curled green onion.

Pre-heat your oven to 290F.
Combine the soy, mirin, sake and sugar.
Place the pork belly in a baking dish that's not too much bigger than the pork belly. I use a loaf pan.
Pour the soy mixture over the pork and cover the baking dish with tin foil. You want to get it fairly well sealed.
Place the pork in the pre-heated oven and cook, turning the dish occasionally to ensure even cooking. You are going for an internal temperature of 195F. This will take about 2 hours.
When you hit 195F remove the pork from the marinade and chill. Cool the marinade down and skim and discard the fat from the surface. This is going to be the base of your ramen broth flavouring.
Medium boiled eggs
In a medium saucepan, bring water to a boil. Boil large eggs for 6 minutes 30 seconds. If using extra large eggs boil them for 7 minutes 30 seconds. You may have to adjust your times slightly depending on the exact size of your eggs but this should get you pretty close.
Submerge the eggs in really cold or ice water to chill. This stops the egg yolks from continuing to set up. Peel and set aside. They will warm up in the broth.
Miso tare - the flavouring
Combine the chashu braising liquid with 1/2 cup shiro miso in a small sauce pan over medium low heat.
Warm the chashu miso mixture, mixing the miso gently. It will go in as a 1/2 cup lump so you are trying to get it to gradually dissolve.
Add the bacon and simmer, covered, over the lowest heat for 1 hour. Keep an eye on it. You may need to add a bit of chicken stock to thin it out a bit. You want to wind up with about the same amount of miso tare that you started with. Remove and discard the bacon.
Miso ramen
Cook the noodles per the instructions on the package. If the instructions are in Japanese 4 minutes is about right for the thin ramen noodles. Drain and set aside. Don't let them sit too long. Try to time it so the noodles are ready when you are ready to assemble the ramen bowls.
Heat the chicken broth to a simmer.
Using your sharpest thin knife cut the eggs in half lengthwise. They will be a bit runny inside so be ready.
Slice the pork belly. You want it about 3/16 inches thick. Warm it in the chicken broth briefly.
Add about 4 Tbsp miso tare to each of 4 pre-warmed bowls. Then add 2 cups of chicken stock to each bowl. Stir and taste. You will want to add a bit more tare. You are going for the point where you are not quite sure if it's too salty. That's when it's perfect. This should be around 5 Tbsp but really this is up to your taste. It will probably be less if you used regular sodium soy sauce or there was sodium in your chicken broth.

Cook the beef or chicken
Slice the beef into 1/4 inch slices or cut the chicken into 3/4 inch cubes.
Heat the oil in a pan large enough to hold the stock until it just shimmers.
Fry the beef or chicken until just done. Remove.
Medium boiled eggs
Gently lower the eggs into the boiling water (the water for the noodles) and cook for 6 1/2 minutes.
After 6 1/2 minutes place the eggs in a bowl of ice water to cool. You want them to cool quickly to stop the yolks from hardening.
Once they have cooled slice each egg in half lengthwise. Be careful. The yolks still have a bit of runny texture.
Make the broth
Chop the cubes into small pieces
Deglaze the pan with a bit of chicken stock then add about another cup of stock.
Add the chopped cubes into the stock and bring to a boil. These things don't dissolve very well so you will have to chase them with a spatula.
Once the cubes have dissolved add the remaining stock and simmer for about 4-5 minutes.

For 40 gyoza 2 Tbsp of soy to 1 Tbsp of rice wine vinegar should be about enough. Scale it up - 2 parts soy to 1 part rice wine vinegar if you need more...
The filling
Slice the napa cabbage as thinly as you can.
Mix in 1 tsp salt and let the cabbage stand for around 15 minutes.
Working a big handful at a time, squeeze the water out of the cabbage. Do this over the sink. Squeeze hard to get as much water out as possible or your gyoza will be soggy.
Add the chives, ginger, garlic, togarashi shichimi, miso and sesame oil. Mix thoroughly. You especially want to distribute the garlic and ginger evenly.
Now mix in the pork. Get you hands in there and really, really mix. Go nuts. This is important. The cabbage keeps the pork from getting tough as it cooks.
Shape the gyoza
Have a small bowl of water handy.
Place a wonton wrapper on a cutting board.
Shape a small ball (like a big marble) of the filling and place it in the middle of the wrapper.
Wet about 1/2 the edge (circumference) of the wrapper with a bit of water. Just dip your finger in the bowl of water and rub the outer edge of the wrapper.
Fold the wrapper over the filling to form a semi-circle. Pinch the middle of the semi-circle where the two halves touch.
Now make those irritating little pleats. Do the side to the right of the point where the two sides are pinched, then do the left. Google a video for this. It helps. Or be a trend setter and just don't bother.
Cook the gyoza
Pre-heat a frying pan with a tight fitting lid over medium heat. Non-stick won't brown the gyoza as well as a regular pan but they do have a tendency to stick a bit so decide what your priorities are.
Add 1 tsp vegetable oil and 1 tsp sesame oil.
Making sure you don't let the gyoza touch, carefully place as many as will reasonably fit in the pan and fry, flat side down (pleated side up if you bothered) for about 2 minutes. Check to see how they are browning.
When they are just a bit less brown than you want, add a 1/4 cup of water. Be careful. You are adding water to hot oil. That's generally not a good idea. It will splatter.
Cover, turn the heat to medium-low and cook for about 2-3 minutes.
Remove the lid, turn the heat back to medium and cook until the water has evaporated.
If you are into food safety, check the internal temperature with an instant read thermometer. You want the inside to read at least 160F. I've never seen it not get there but it's always a good idea to check.

They will stick or worse, burn if you cut back.)', 'the root vegetables', 'the spice mix', 'cilantro and Vietnamese garlic chili paste to garnish']","Do your prep
Combine the curry powder, black pepper, turmeric and salt in a small bowl. Get your bay leaves ready
Pick off the tough outer layer of the lemongrass. Cut each stalk into three even pieces.
Peel the carrots, sweet potato and potatoes. Cut them all into 1 inch pieces
Chop your shallots. Mince the garlic and ginger.
Skin the chicken. Give is a liberal sprinkling of salt. You are now good to go.
Shallow fry the vegetables and the chicken
A wok is great for this. If you have one use that. If you don't something around a 10 inch pot should also do the trick. You can go bigger but you will need more oil. You want the oil somewhere around 2/3 of an inch deep.
Heat 2 cups of oil over medium heat (or thereabouts - remember around 2/3 inch deep). You are going for a temperature of around 350F for the oil. Slip in a piece of sweet potato. If lively bubbles form around it you know you're good.
You'll need to do this in 2 batches. Shallow fry all the sweet potatoes and half the carrots. Use a slotted spoon to flip them around so they brown evenly. The sweet potatoes take about 3 minutes. The carrots take about 4 minutes. You are going for lightly browned on the sweet potatoes and kind of blistered looking on the carrots. When they are done transfer them to a bowl lined with paper towel.
For the second batch fry the other half of the carrots and the potatoes. Light brown on the potatoes and blistered looking for the carrots.
The oil is hot anyway so you might as well fry the chicken. GIve it around 2 minutes per side. You want colour but you aren't trying to cook the chicken through here. Transfer them to a bowl (no paper towel required) when the come out of the oil.
Make the Vietnamese chicken curry
Heat the 4 tbsp vegetable oil over medium heat in a pot large enough to hold all the ingredients. Add the shallots and sweat until they are translucent and soft. This should take 3-4 minutes.
Add the garlic and ginger and cook for another minute or so.
Turn the heat down to medium low. Push the vegetables off to one side. You should have a puddle of oil in the middle of the pan. Its time to bloom the spices. Add the spice mix. Stir to make sure all the spice is well coated in oil. You may need a splash more oil if it looks dry. Don't worry, you can spoon off some of the oil at the end if you want. Blooming the spices is really important so err on the side of a bit too much oil.
Cook the spices for about 90 seconds to 2 minutes. Be careful. You don't want the spices to burn. This step is critical. It's also a really good trick to have in your bag for anything heavy on spice (think Indian and Mexican).
Add the coconut milk, the chicken stock and 2 tbsp of fish sauce. Give it a good stir. Add the carrots, potatoes and the chicken. Hold the sweet potato back. It takes a little less time to cook sweet potatoes.
Toss in the lemongrass and bay leaf. Bring to a simmer and cook for about 10 minutes.
Add the sweet potato and cook until the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 170F for dark meat. This should take another 15 minutes. If you are using white meat you are going for 160F. Probably want to add your sweet potato in around 5 minutes sooner for white meat.

Joint the chicken. Quarter the chicken, removing the back. Separate the thighs from the drumsticks. Remove the wings from the breasts. Cut each breast into 3 roughly equal pieces. You should have 12 pieces of chicken.
Combine the marinade ingredients. In a large bowl, toss the chicken in the marinade. Marinate for no more than 2 hours. Lemon is an acid. It ""cooks"" the chicken and can result in a mushy texture.
Make the dipping sauce
Chop the ginger, green chili and garlic as finely as you can. If you have a morter and pestle, grind them together.
Add the remaining dipping sauce ingredients and stir thoroughly to dissolve the sugar. Let stand about 1 hour before using.
Grill the chicken
Remove the chicken from marinade.
If using a gas grill, set it up for high indirect heat. Place a drip pan under the grill on the cool side. Grill the chicken over the dripping pan for about 25 minutes. Move the chicken over high heat briefly to add grill marks if desired.
If using a charcoal grill, bank the charcoal on both sides and place a drip pan in the middle. Grill the chicken over the drip pan for about 25 minutes. Move it over the charcoal carefully to add grill marks.
The noodles
Soak the noodles in hot water for 40-45 minutes to soften. Do not boil them. Please.
Heat the oil in a wok or large pan. Add the noodles and stir fry until they soften. Remove the pan from heat. Add 1/3 cup ginger lime dipping sauce. Stir briefly and add the green onion, red pepper and green chili.
Alternately you can serve this with a cool noodle salad. You need to cook the noodles first. A soak won't quite do it. Then toss the noodles with the green onion and the peppers. Drizzle with the dipping sauce and a bit of the herbs and peanuts. Works great either way. Mix it up. It will be fine.

Combine all the ingredients in a small sauce pan. Bring to a gentle simmer and cook for about 2 minutes. Set aside to cool. Yes, it's that easy. Which is good because rolling spring rolls is a little more of a challenge.
Cook your shrimp
Bring 3 cups of water to a boil. Add a 1/2 tsp of salt. Drop your cold, thawed shrimp into the pot. Cover. Remove from heat. Let stand exactly 6 minutes.
While they stand prepare an ice bath. In a large bowl combine ice and water.
After 6 minutes drain the shrimp and plunge into cold water to stop them from continuing to cook.
Cut each shrimp in half lengthwise. Set aside.
Make the spring rolls
Do not overstuff your spring rolls. Just don't do it. It will make you crazy. You don't want them too thin but overstuffed is just a mess waiting to happen.
Place the rice vermicelli in a large bowl. Pour hot tap water overtop to completely submerge.
Let stand around 10 minutes or so. Check. You want them a little chewy but not hard. They are probably good to go at this point. If they aren't let them soak another minute or two. Drain and rinse under cold water.
Prep your ingredients. Stem the mint leaves and cilantro. Have your lettuce and shrimp at hand. If you are using carrots or cucumbers keep them close as well.
Fill a large bowl with warm(almost hot) tap water. Not as hot as it goes but pretty warm.
You are making little rice paper burritos. Think about it like that. You want to be able to fold the ends over and then roll them up. Just like a burrito. You have to move fast. Make a couple practice rolls before you start adding the shrimp.
Put a lettuce leaf flat on a cutting board. Put a little rice vermicelli on top. Now add a few sprigs of cilantro (be generous) and roll it into a little lettuce cigar. You want it about 4-5 inches long. Set it to the side of the cutting board.
Top with julienned carrot and cucumber.
Dip a rice paper sheet in the warm water for about 2-3 seconds. It will still be firm but that's OK. Lay it flat on a cutting board. Place a couple mint leaves about a 1/3 of the way down from the side furthest away from you. Arrange the shrimp around the mint. Make sure the cut side is up.
Place the lettuce cigar in the bottom third . Carefully peel up one side (your left or right) and fold it over the filling. Repeat on the other side.
Peel up the side closest to you. Place it overtop the lettuce wrap. Now roll the whole thing away you. Be careful. The rice paper sheet will be very soft by this point. You want to start fairly tight and then relax as you roll over the shrimp.
Do this without the shrimp a couple times. It will come. Just be patient and deliberate. Once you hit your rhythm start making them with shrimp.

Mint']","The aromatics
Pre-heat your oven to 350F.
Roast the onion and ginger for 1 hour.
Let cool. Slice the onion in half and the ginger into 1/2 inch pieces.
The chicken
In a 5-6 quart dutch oven or pot combine the whole chicken, 4-5 green onions, the 1/2 inch piece of ginger and the salt. Add 8 cups of stock plus enough water to cover the chicken. If you can't quite cover the chicken start it breast side down.
Bring to a simmer and poach for about 20 minutes (breast side down if needed). Flip the bird and continue to poach until the chicken reaches about 155F in the breast and 165F in the thigh - about 10 minutes. Use an instant read thermometer - there's no other safe way to do this. The chicken will continue to cook after you remove it from the broth so give yourself some room. You are going for a final internal temperature of 165F in the breast and 175F in the thigh.
Set the chicken aside to cool enough to handle. Remove chicken from the bones. You don't have to be perfect. You have lots of chicken.
The broth
Remove and discard the 1/2 inch piece of ginger. Keep the stock and green onion in the pot.
Return the chicken bones to the pot along with the roasted ginger and onion.
Add the brown sugar.
Let simmer 3-4 hours, loosely covered.
Strain. You should have about 10 cups of broth. If you have less, add some water to make up for evaporation.
Refrigerate until ready for use. If you refrigerate you can skim the fat and reserve. That way you can add a tsp or so per bowl as they do in Vietnam.
When ready to serve heat the broth to just below a boil and add the fish sauce. This is where the final seasoning happens. Your broth may still under-salted. Decide for yourself. Start adding salt a half a tsp at a time. You want it pretty salty - adding in the chicken and the noodles blunts the saltiness some.
Pho ga
Do your prep. Slice or shred the chicken. Cut up some green onion. Prep your herbs. Slice your shallot as thinly as you possibly can. Slice some red chili. Cut up the lime. Pre-heat your bowls. Make sure your broth is good and hot. Have it all ready to go. Once you start things go fast and cold pho is not good pho.
Cook the noodles
Here's a trick to cook rice noodles for pho that I found buried at the bottom of an Epicurious recipe. Soak your rice noodles in cold water for about 30 minutes.
At the same time, bring a large pot of water to a boil.
Put the soaked noodles in a big strainer and drop it into the boiling water.
Stir the noodles and start checking them for texture after about 30 seconds. They should be done in under a minute. You want them slightly toothy as they will cook a bit more in the broth.
When you have them how you want them, pull the noodles and divide into 4 bowls.
Top the noodles with the chicken and sprinkle with green onions and sliced shallots.
Pour 1/4 of the broth into each bowl.
Serve with the condiments on the table to let people flavour their pho as they like it.",en-US,4.29,,glebe kitchen,300,4 serving(s),4 servings,1004 kcal,111 g,55 g,36 g,10 g,163 mg,2807 mg,8 g,2 g,,

Soak 10 wooden skewers in water for at least 30 minutes.
Combine the ground pork, shallots, garlic, toasted rice powder, sugar, fish sauce and sambal oelek in a mixing bowl.
Use your hands to mix thoroughly.
Transfer half the pork mixture to a food processor. Pulse about 10-15 times. You want a big homogenous mess.
Repeat with the rest of the pork mixture. You don't want to overload your food processor. It won't mix well if you do. Let the pork mixture sit for about 30 minutes.
While the pork sits, build an indirect charcoal fire in your grill. Bank the coals on both sides and put a drip pan in the middle. If you are using gas, turn on a burner or two but leave a cool zone in the middle. You want the grill at about 500 degrees. Hot.
Here's a nifty grilling tip. To approximate a Japanese grill put two fire bricks sideways with enough space between them to sit the skewers on them. Far apart enough that the meatballs don't touch the bricks but close enough so your skewers sit on them. You don't have to do this. You can grill them how you like. But the brick trick is what I do.
Form the pork mixture into golf ball size balls. You should get around 24 balls.
Thread the pork balls onto the skewers. Take care to try to get the skewers through the middle of the balls so they are balanced. This is tough. Do what you can.
Grill the pork ball skewers until an instant read thermometer reads 160 degrees. This goes pretty fast at 500F. Under 10 minutes. Less maybe. Don't have an instant read thermometer? Time to get one. Seriously. They start at $10. Everybody should have one. Guessing is almost always wrong. Instant read is always right. You want to nail it every time don't you?
Nuoc cham
Combine all the ingredients and stir to combine. Let stand as long as you can. An hour or two isn't out of the question. 10 minutes is probably OK too.
Bun cha
At some point along the way bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook the noodles until tender. The package may or may not have instructions on it (annoying). If it doesn't 3 minutes plus or minus about a minute is usually about right. You want tender. You don't want mush. Rinse under cold water until cool.

Pick a pot that will hold the beef brisket and stock that is small enough that you can submerge the beef while it simmers.
Take a look at your brisket. Figure out which way the grain runs. You are going to need to know that when you slice it.
Combine the chicken stock, beef brisket, star anise, cinnamon stick, black cardamom, onion, ginger, salt and fish sauce. Bring to a simmer.
Simmer for about 2 to 2 1/2 hours. At this point your broth should smell like pho. Remove the beef and strain the stock through a couple sheets of paper towel or some cheesecloth. This is important if you want a nice clear broth. Add the sugar.
Chill the beef. Chill it well. An ice bath if you're in a hurry. The fridge if you're not.
Beef pho
Soak your noodles in cold water for 30 minutes. Make sure there's enough water to fully submerge them.
Slice the chilled beef as thinly as you can. Slice it against the grain. You checked which way the grain runs, right?
Heat up your pho broth. Taste it. It will need more salt. Use a mix of fish sauce and kosher salt. Creep up on it. Add about a tbsp of fish sauce. Then a 1/4 tsp of salt at a time until you hit the taste you want. It takes quite a bit.
Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Put the noodles in a strainer that will fit in the pot. Cook the noodles about 30 seconds. Try one. If it's nicely chewy you are done. If not, cook the noodles another 30 seconds. It shouldn't take more than a minute total.
Put 1/4 of the noodles in each of two bowls. Toss in the brisket. Add the rest of the noodles. Put the sliced eye of the round on top of the noodles. Sprinkle with green onions and shallots.

Cut up the lemongrass. Remove the tough outer pieces. You want the tender inside bits. If it's hard to push a sharp knife through it, it is not tender.
Combine all the marinade ingredients. That is everything except the pork in the pork and marinade section of the ingredients. Use a bowl that's big enough to hold all the pork. And give you enough room to mix it all up.
Stir to combine the marinade ingredients. Add the pork. Use your hands to mix it all up. You want the pork coated.
Cover with plastic wrap, refrigerate and marinate 1 to 12 hours. I usually go 3 or 4 hours. I've cut it back to one hour even. It works fine.
Do your prep
Make your nuoc cham. Prep your herbs. If you are making any quick pickled carrots do it now.
Soften your rice vermicelli. Bring a kettle to boil. Pick a large bowl. Pour boiling water over the noodles. Let it sit for around 5 minutes and start checking it for tenderness. Different brands take different times but I've never seen it go over 10 minutes. Probably not even 8 minutes.
When the noodles are tender drain. Rinse under cold water until cool. Set aside.
Prep your noodle bowls
You want this done before you start grilling. Or somebody else can do it while you grill.
Place 1/4 of the noodles in 4 bowls. Add your choice of garnishes. Cut up some lime. Put out the nuoc cham. All that should be left to add is the pork.
Grill the pork
This is the hard part. Grilling thinly sliced pork shoulder is not trivial.
Set up your grill for medium hot direct fire. Find something that will keep the pork from falling through the grill. A fine grill like they sell at Asian shops works. A vegetable grill (the non-stick ones with the holes in them) will work but not as well. Find something though. Do not try to grill this on your regular grate. You will wind up angry. And hungry.
Health safety tip here. You are going to need two sets of tongs. One for cooking and one to remove the pork from the grill. Be careful. Don't mix them up.
Work in batches. Don't try to grill it all at once. Try to lay it as flat as you can using the tongs. As the pork starts going opaque flip it. It will bunch up. It will fight you. Don't worry. Pork shoulder is pretty forgiving. Make sure the bunched up areas are cooked. When the first batch is finished repeat until all the pork is cooked.

Roast the beef ribs in a 325 degree oven for around 30-40 minutes. You want them to brown up a bit.
Bruise the lemongrass. Cut it in half and whack it repeatedly with the dull side of a big knife until it starts to break open.
Combine the roasted ribs (or leftover ribs from a rib roast), lemongrass, chicken stock, star anise, black cardamom, shallots and fish sauce in a pot large enough to hold all the ingredients.
Bring to a simmer and cook until the beef separates easily from the bone. This takes 90-120 minutes or so.
This next step is optional. If you like the textured bits in pho (like tendon) then go for it. If you prefer just sliced beef then leave the meat on the bones and continue simmering. Your broth will be beefier for it.
Remove the ribs from the pot. Let cool slightly. While you are at it remove everything except the shallots from the pot. Once the ribs have cooled enough to handle remove the meat and refrigerate. Return the stripped beef bones to the pot and continue simmering for a total of 4 hours. If your beef took 2 hours to get tender simmer for another 2 hours. Or, if you don't want the more interesting bits then just skip this step. Leave the beef on the bones but do remove the lemongrass, star anise and cardamom.
After 4 hours, remove the beef bones. Strain. Add enough water or stock to bring the total volume back to 6 cups. Refrigerate briefly. You want the fat to set up. There's too much at this point. Once the stock is chilled skim off the fat. Keep it handy though. Don't throw it away.
Return the skimmed stock to the pot. Bring to a simmer. Taste and adjust for salt.
Add three tablespoons of fat to a small sauce pan or frying pan. Heat over medium low heat. It will sputter for a bit as the water boils off. You should have enough fat. If you don't make up the difference with vegetable oil.
Add the bun bo Hue spice to the pan. Stir to coat the spices in oil and fry gently for about 30 seconds. Let this cool briefly and add about a tablespoon of the spice/fat mixture to the broth. Be careful. Hot fat into stock can bubble a bit. Taste and decide if it's spicy enough. If not, add a bit more and taste again. Once you have the salt and spice right your broth is done. Keep warm.
Prep the rice noodles
Soak the noodles in cool water for 30 minutes.
Bring a large pot of water to a brisk boil. A pasta pot works really well here. The type with the built in colander.
Add the pre-soaked noodles to the boiling water. Stir.
Start checking the noodles after around 30 seconds. You want them a little bit toothy. This can take a minute or so.
Remove the noodles from the hot water. Rinse with cold water. Keep the hot water handy.
Assemble the soup
Bring the broth back to a lively simmer.
Put the noodles back into the hot cooking water to warm through. This takes under 30 seconds if the water is still hot.
Divide the noodles into two bowls. Add the beef, green onions, shallots and red chili slices. Pour half the piping hot broth into each bowl.

Prepare your greens, red onion and tomatoes. Set aside.
Combine the all sauce ingredients in a small bowl. You will be deglazing your pan with this sauce.
Cook the beef
Pre-heat a heavy frying pan that will hold the steaks in a single layer over medium to medium high heat. Right before you start frying the steaks, season liberally with salt and pepper.
Turn on your ventilation fan. This is going to smoke.
Place the beef in the pan and fry around 3-4 minutes. You want a nice crust on the beef. This should get you to about medium rare. Depends on how thick your steaks are and how hot your pan is. I can't be more precise because I just don't know your specific details.
Flip the steak and cook it another 3 minutes. Remove and let rest around 10 minutes. Check your internal temperature. 125F is rare. 130 is medium rare. Remove the pan from the heat.
After the steak has rested for 10 minutes cut the beef into big bite size chunks.
Return the pan to medium low heat. Keep an eye on it. You don't want your fond to burn. Once it is heated add the garlic and cook around 30 seconds.
Turn the heat up and deglaze the pan with the sauce. Scrape up all that delicious brown gold and stir to get it to dissolve into the sauce.
As soon as you have finished deglazing the pan turn down the heat to low. Taste it. Now start adding the rice wine vinegar. You are looking for a nice balance of acid and savoury. Creep up on it.
When you get to the point you are happy with your sauce (now your vinaigrette really) return the beef to the pan. Heat through gently. You don't want it to cook more. Just warm it up.
To serve spread your greens out on a plate. Top with onions and tomatoes. Drizzle with a bit of vegetable oil. Spoon the beef onto this mixture and drizzle with the sauce. Serve with lime wedges.

Heat the oil in a dutch oven over medium heat.
Work in batches. Lightly brown the meat in batches. Don't crowd the meat. Leave a half inch around pieces. It doesn't have to be super brown like when making a good French stew but it does need to be brown. Set the beef aside.
If you need more oil add it now. Then add the onions to the same pot used to brown the beef. Cook until soft and well browned, about 10 minutes. Regulate the heat so the onions don't burn.
Reduce heat to medium low. Move the onions to the outer edges and add a splash of oil. Add the whole spices (cloves, cardamom, cinnamon and bay) and cook about 30 seconds.
Leaving the onions on the edge, add the spice mix. Cook for around 90 seconds, stirring constantly. You want enough oil to keep everything wet. If it looks dry, add a Tbsp or two of vegetable oil.

Pre-heat a small skillet over medium-low heat.
Add the spices except the kashmiri chilies to the skillet.
Toast, shaking the pan, until they just start to get fragrant. This should take a two or three minutes. Add the kashmiri chilies and toast until the chilies start to colour. This happens fast so pay attention.
Let cool and grind to a powder with little chunks in it. Not super fine but not coarse either. Fine with little coarse bits in it. I should take a picture. I like a coffee grinder for this. The old ones with the blade work well. Not the best for coffee. Great for spices.
You won't need all of it so transfer it to a jar with a tight fitting lid and store in a cool, dark place so it's ready for next time.
Do your prep
Measure out your spice mix. Prep your chicken. Measure out a cup (237 ml) of Indian hotel curry gravy. Cut up your green chilies if using.
Make sure you have everything ready to go.
Make the achari chicken curry
Heat the oil in a medium sized frying pan until the oil just starts to shimmer.
Stir in the garlic ginger paste. Gently fry until the garlic ginger paste stops sputtering. This can get a little messy.
Turn your heat down to medium low and add your spice mix. Cook for about 30 seconds. You want to fry your spices in the oil. Don't skimp on the oil. Bad things happen if the spices stick and burn.
Add the green chilies if you are using them. Cook another 30 seconds or so.
Add the Indian hotel curry gravy. Stir it really well to get the oil to combine with the curry gravy. You want everything mixed together at this point. Bring to a simmer.
Add the chicken thigh pieces in a single layer. Nestle them down into the sauce. Cover and ccok about 5 minutes. Remove the cover, flip the chicken and recover. Cook until the chicken is done. Use an instant read thermometer if you have one. You are shooting for an internal temperature of 160F. It will get to 170F as the curry finishes cooking.
Add the garlic pickle (or whatever pickle you decide to use) and the optional naga pickle if using. Stir well to combine.
Look at the consistency. You have a decision to make. If the chicken threw a lot of liquid the sauce might be right. If not, add a tablespoon or two of chicken stock and mix it in. Look again. If you are happy with it, cover and simmer for 2 minutes. If it's still too thick, add a bit morestock. I've never added more than a 1/4 cup.

This goes fast. Be ready. Make your spice mix. Get your ingredients out and close to the stove.
Make the Ceylon chicken curry
Heat the oil in a medium frying pan until it just starts to shimmer.
Add the green cardamom, cassia bark and curry leaves. Cook about 30 seconds. You want to see little bubbles forming around your whole spices. It you don't get them right from the start heat your oil a little more next time. What you don't want to do is panic and crank the heat. You will just wind up burning things in the next step.
Stir in the garlic ginger paste and green chilies. Cook until the garlic ginger paste stops sputtering.
Turn your heat to medium low and add your spice mix. This is why you added a full 3 tablespoons of oil at the beginning. You want your spices to fry in the oil. Too little oil and the spices will stick or burn and you will be starting over.
Gently fry the spices in the oil, stirring constantly, for about 30 seconds. This is where magic happens. Volatile compounds in the spices will be released into the oil. And that is big flavour.
Turn the heat up to medium. Add the Indian hotel curry gravy. Bring to a simmer. Really stir it to get the oil to combine and cook for about a minute. You don't need it to fry hard like a regular restaurant curry. That's the beauty of hotel style. You already have that done. No need to make a mess of your stove.
Add the chicken in an even layer and cover the pan. After about 5 minutes flip the chicken pieces. Tongs are good for this. Can't beat a good set of restaurant tongs in the kitche. Cook until the chicken is just done.
The chicken should take around 8-12 minutes to cook through. It really depends on how large the chicken thigh pieces are. Best bet is to use an instant read thermometer and go for 170F.
Once the chicken is done, stir in the coconut milk and tamarind paste. Simmer for one minute.
The texture should be about right at this point. If it's too thick add a bit of water or chicken stock Not a lot. Probably a couple tablespoons max.
If it is too thin (chicken throws a fair bit of liquid as it cooks) just let the curry simmer uncovered for a minute or two.
Taste and decide if you fall in the slightly sweet camp. If you do add the sugar and stir. It will open up the flavours a bit. I like it.

Stem and seed the kashmiri chilies (not the ones in the curry - just the ones in the paste).
Soak your kashmiri chilies in hot, hot water for a few minutes. Drain and repeat. Repeat again. You may not need the third soak. You want them hydrated. Soft.
Combine all the ingredients in a mini food processor or your blender.
Puree. It will probably fight you. Scrape it down into the bowl try again. If that doesn't work add a bit more water and try again. You don't want a ton of water so add a bit at time. If it still doesn't go, add a bit more. Until it does go. Super annoying. I know.
Make your lamb vindaloo
Do your prep. The vindaloo paste is ready to go, right? You've pre-cooked your lamb? Combine the Indian restaurant spice mix, kashmiri chili powder, kasoor methi and salt in a small bowl. Preheat your curry base. Dilute the tomato paste. Now you're good to go.
Heat your frying pan (don't use non-stick) briefly over medium heat. Add the oil. It's ready when the oil just starts to shimmer. You may notice I'm using less oil that usual. That's because there's some in the paste as well.
Add the Kashmiri chilies and cook for about 10 seconds. Flip them and cook another 10 seconds. You should see little bubbles form around the chili. You want it toasted. Not burned. Be careful.
Turn down the heat and add the combined spice mix, kashmiri chili powder, kasoor methi and salt. This is the critical step. Stir it constantly for 30 seconds. If it starts to darken lift the pan off the heat. You want the spice mix to cook in the oil but not burn. If your spices burn start again. It can't be saved.
Add the vindaloo paste. Fry, stirring constantly, until it starts to darken. This should take about 2 to 3 minutes.
Turn the heat up to medium high. This is important. The Maillard reaction makes this work. Google Maillard if you don't know what I'm talking about. It gives curry it's Indian restaurant flavour. Add the diluted tomato paste and stir until bubbles form. This takes around 30 seconds to one minute depending on the heat.
Add 3 oz of curry base. Stir until bubbles form, around 60 seconds. It's like a lively boil except the curry base is frying in the oil.
Now add 6 oz of curry base and stir briefly. Let it cook until the bubbles form again. Let it cook about 2 minutes.
Add the rest of the curry base and let cook until the bubbles form. Stir in the tamarind paste, sugar and worcestershire sauce. Turn the heat down to low and add the pre-cooked lamb.

Bring enough water to cover the cauliflower to a boil. Add some salt. Like you were making pasta. Cook the cauliflower for 3-4 minutes. You want it just barely tender. Remove from the water and set aside to cool.
Make the batter
Combine all the batter ingredients except the water. Stir to mix thoroughly.
Add 3/4 cup water and mix to create a smooth batter. I like the batter a little thin so I add a couple extra tablespoons of water. You want the cauliflower coated with batter. You don't want them to turn out like sweet and sour chicken balls in a bad Chinese restaurant. All batter and no filling is not good.
Make the sauce
Pre-heat a frying pan over medium high heat. Add the oil, red pepper and onion. Fry aggressively. You want the peppers to blister a bit if you can. This is taking a page out of the jalfrezi playbook. A little bit smoky taste adds a nice touch. You are cooking them until the peppers are soft and the onions start to char a bit. Add the green chilies towards the end. Maybe the last minute or so.
Turn the heat down to medium and add the garlic ginger paste. Stir until it stops spluttering - about 30 seconds.
Mix in the soy, rice wine vinegar and chili sauce. Stir to combine. Add 1/4 cup water (not the water with the cornstarch) and bring to a simmer.
At this point you need to decide how sticky you want the sauce. I usually add about a tablespoon of the cornstarch water mix. That works out to a little less than a teaspoon of cornstarch. If you want really thick and gloppy add more.
Add about a tablespoon of the cornstarch mixture. Bring to a simmer. Now decide if that works for you. If not add a bit more. Do not add it all. You will make glue.
Taste your sauce for salt. It probably needs about 1/4 tsp.
Get ready to deep fry
Heat enough oil to deep fry (about 3 inches deep) in a large pot. A dutch oven works well. Pre-heat the oil to 335-350F. Use a candy/frying thermometer.
Cook the cauliflower
Mix the cauliflower with the batter. Be gentle. Add about half the cauliflower to the oil. Regulate the heat to try to keep it around 325-350F.
The cauliflower is done before it goes into the oil so you are really just cooking the batter. Remove the cauliflower when it gets golden brown. Place it on a wire rack on a cookie sheet.
Repeat with the other half of the battered cauliflower.
At this point stop and taste one of the fritters. Decide if you just want to stop here next time. Serve it up with a little tamarind chutney. I really like this for an appetizer.
Finish it off

Heat a small skillet over medium low heat. Add the cinnamon bark, star anise, and black cardamom. Toast until just starting to get fragrant. You will smell cinnamon.
Add the fennel seed, black peppercorn, cumin seed, and cloves. Toast another 30 seconds or so.
Let cool. Transfer the whole spices along with the mace, pomegranate seed and Indian bay leaves to a spice grinder. You will need to break up the bay leaves to get them to fit. Grind to a powder.
Add the kashmiri chili powder, coriander powder, ginger powder and nutmeg powder and stir to combine. This is your nihari masala.
make the nihari gosht
Pre-heat your oven to 325F.
Heat 6 tbsp of the oil in a dutch oven large enough to hold all the ingredients (or 4 tbsp ghee and 2 tbsp oil) over medium low heat.
Add the sliced onion and cook, stirring regularly, until the onion starts to brown. You may need to adjust your heat up a bit.
Once the onion has started to brown turn the heat back to medium low if necessary. Add the whole spices and cook for about 30 seconds.
Now add the nihari masala and salt and stir to combine. You want the spices coated in fat. If it looks dry add a bit more oil or ghee. Cook, stirring constantly, for about about a minute. Watch carefully. You don't want your spices to burn.
Add the beef and stir to combine. Cook the beef, stirring occasionally, until you no longer see any red. Be careful. You still don't want your spices to burn. If the spices start to stick you may need to add the remaining oil/ghee to make this work. I usually do.
Add half the yoghurt. Stir to combine and cook for about a minute. Add the rest of the yoghurt and repeat.
Add the water and the marrow bones if you can get them. Bring to a simmer. Cover the pot with a sheet of aluminium foil and then the lid. This acts similar to a flour dum. Another French trick.
Place in the 325F oven and cook. Give it a stir every hour. Cook until tender. This should take 2 to 2 1/2 hours. There's no hard and fast rule. It's done when it's tender. That depends on how close your oven is to mine. It depends on the size of the beef. And it depends on the beef. So nobody can tell you for sure. It's done when it's done I'm afraid.
When the beef is tender remove the dutch oven from the oven. Set on the stove. Give it a few minutes to stop simmering. There should be a good layer of bright red fat floating on the surface. That stuff is gold.
Skim off as much fat as you want to remove. Remember that fat has all sorts of wonderful flavours in it so don't go overboard. A little fat is good. If you are going to remove the bones now is the time to do it. But please don't think bones are a bad thing. Leaving them in is good too. Up to you.
Transfer 4 tablespoons of the fat to a small saucepan over medium low heat. Add 3 tablepoons of whole wheat flour. Stir to get all the flour coated in the fat. Cook the fat flour mixture for about 90 seconds, stirring constantly.
Add about a tablespoon of liquid from the nihari pot and stir to combine. It will turn into this thick paste. Don't panic. Do it again. And again. And again. After the 4th time add a bit more at a time. Maybe 2 tablespoons or so. Stir until it all comes together. Do that again. And again.
Now add around a 1/2 cup. Stir to combine. Finally add around a cup. Stir until it's a nice even texture. It should have the consistency of a fairly thick gravy at this point. Add this mixture into the nihari and stir to combine. Bring to a gentle simmer. If it seems a bit thicker than you would like add a bit of water. Up to a cup or so.
Taste at this point and adjust salt. It will need a bit more but not alot so be careful and creep up on it.
Add most of the julienned ginger. Keep a bit back for garnish.
To serve, spoon into bowls and garnish with a cilantro and a little bit of julienned ginger. Serve with an Indian flatbread. I like chapatis with nihari but naan works as well.

This is actually easier with a mortar and pestle. You will fight hard using a mini food processor unless you make lots.
Combine the roasted peanuts and sesame seeds in your mortar and pestle. Beat on them to break them down.

It will probably be too thick at this point. Thin it out with some stock. You want a texture somewhere around a full-bodied cream of soup.

Chicken Karahi
Be ready. Have your curry base simmering on the stove. Make your spice mix. Chop all the ingredients and have them at the ready. This is going to go very fast. You don't have time to mess around.

Slice your onion thinly. Really thinly. Cut it in half lengthwise. Set a half down on your cutting board. Cut off the stem end but leave the root end . Slice across the onion so you get half moon rings. Once you are done slicing the first half cut the onion slices in half to form quarter rings. Repeat the whole process with the other half onion.
Deflame the onion. Takes the bite out of it. Put the sliced onion in a fine mesh strainer. Rinse under cold water for about a minute. Transfer the onion to a bowl of cold water. Let the onions soak in the fridge for 10 minutes. Drain. You can do this when you are making salsa as well. Smooths all the rough edges of the onion. This is a good restaurant trick for anything with raw onions.
Combine the ketchup, cumin seed, masala chili sauce, salt and amchoor powder. Stir to combine. If you taste it now it will seem pretty spicy. Depending on the chili masala sauce you pick of course. Don't worry. The onions will dilute the heat. And papadum seem to soak up the fire. If anything it could be spicier if that's what you like.
Fold in the onions. Mix thoroughly to coat the onions with the tomato mixture. If you have time refrigerate the red onion chutney for about an hour to mellow the flavours. It's good right away. It's a little better after it sits for a while. Taste it right before you are ready to serve and adjust the salt.
Easy mint raita
Combine all the ingredients except the milk in a small bowl. Stir it up. Now decide if you like the texture.
If you want it thinner add some milk, a teaspoon at a time, until you get to your desired consistency. Taste and adjust salt.
How to cook papadum
Have your red onion chutney and mint raita ready to go before you start cooking papadum. Papadum do not taste good once they cool too much. They are great hot. They are not great cold. Trust me on this one. Nobody will like cold papadum.
Pick a skillet a little bigger than the papadum. 10 inch diameter is about perfect. Bigger is OK but it takes more oil.
A good set of tongs is essential here. Have them ready when you start cooking.
Pour enough oil into your pan to get it about 1/2 inch deep. Heat your oil to around 350F. Use a thermometer. Guessing never works well. If you must guess you want your papadum to cook in about 8-10 seconds and not wind up too brown. Thermometers are way easier. Better food through science.
Have a plate with some paper towel on it nearby. You are going to need to have it close to the pan or you are going to drip oil everywhere.
Slip a papadum into the oil. It will start to curl and cook immediately. After around 4-5 seconds grab it with your tongs and flip it. It will be pretty solid so this should be easy. Cook another 3-5 seconds. Grab one edge of the papadum and hold it vertically above the oil to drain a bit.
Transfer the cooked papadum to the plate with the tongs. I like to have my tongs in my dominant hand and the plate in my other hand when I do this.
Repeat no more than 6 times. Don't serve cold papdum. Just don't do it. Have I mentioned that?
Serve the papadum with the red onion chutney and mint raita. Let your guests decide what they want to put on their papadum.",en-US,5.0,,glebe kitchen,30,6 serving(s),,,,,,,,,,,,

Combine all the dry powdered spices and salt in a small bowl.
Combine all the whole spices in another small bowl
Make the chicken bhuna
Heat the oil in a pot with a lid that is large enough to hold all the ingredients over medium heat. When the oil starts to shimmer add the onions.
Cook the onions until they are browned on the edges. You aren't going for the deep brown onions this time. This should take 10 to 15 minutes.
Add the garlic ginger paste. Cook about a minute more.
Push the onions to one side. Give them a squeeze with a wooden spoon or spatula to get the oil into the pan. Add the whole spices and cook until you see little bubbles forming around the spices.
Pay attention to this step. Turn the heat to medium low. Add the powdered spice mix. Stir to combine thoroughly with the oil. You are going for a spicy oil slurry. You should have enough oil but if it looks dry add another tablespoon.
Cook the powdered spices for about a minute, stirring regularly. You need to be careful here. If you have enough oil the spices shouldn't burn. Burnt spices is the kiss of death. You have to start over if you burn them. If you have any doubts just push the pot off the burner.
Now stir the spice slurry into the onions. Mix it all up. Cook for about a minute more.
Add the pureed tomatoes. Stir to combine. Reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for about 10 minutes.
Add the chicken. Give it a stir and bring to a lively simmer. Cover loosely, reduce heat to get a gentle simmer and cook, stirring occasionally until the chicken is cooked through. Chicken thighs are perfectly cooked at 170F. Use your instant read thermometer. You have an instant read thermometer right? If you don't, you are just guessing.
The chicken should be done in 20-25 minutes. Keep an eye on it. Give it a gentle stir every 5 minutes or so. You want this to be a pretty dry curry. The chicken will throw liquid as it cooks. If it looks really saucy take the lid off completely to finish cooking.
Add the tamarind or lemon and a good handful of chopped cilantro. Stir to combine. Cook for a couple more minutes. If it's too thick add a splash of water. Once you have reached your desired consistency taste and adjust salt.

Place on a cookie sheet or pizza pan, skin side down. Sprinkle with salt.
Roast in the oven until the eggplant is soft and just starting to colour. This should take about 25 minutes.

Light your grill. You want to grill over medium high direct heat. But you also want to leave yourself a cooler zone. For charcoal bank your fire on one side. For gas simply leave an element on low with the rest on medium high.

Once you have skewered all the meat, transfer the kebabs to the grill. It's never a bad idea to give yourself a little insulation over the exposed wood portion of the skewers. A little strip of tin foil can make the difference between burned skewer stumps and useful skewers.
Grill, turning every couple minutes until the lamb is cooked through. You want an internal temperature of 160F. I know that is high but in the case of ground meat you need to be careful. Sucks. I know. Safety first.

Make your spice mix. Cut up your green chilies, onion, green pepper and tomatoes. Make your naga chicken tikka - or whatever chicken tikka you prefer. Have everything ready.
DIlute your curry gravy with 1/4 cup (4 tbsp) of chicken stock. You need to dilute it because the chicken is going in pre-cooked.
Make your quick naga chicken tikka
Combine the tandoori masala, kasoor methi, salt (if necessary), naga pickle and oil in a bowl large enough to hold all the chicken. This is your chicken marinade. It does not go into the final curry.
Add the chicken and combine with the marinade. Use tongs. This stuff will stain your fingers.
Marinate for about an hour. Pre-heat your oven to 400F while this is going on. Place a sturdy baking sheet in the oven to pre-heat.
Transfer the chicken (again, use tongs) to that pre-heated, sturdy but not too large baking sheet (can you tell the pre-heated pan is important?). Place in the oven. Cook for about 6 minutes. Flip all the pieces and return to the oven.
Cook until the internal temperature of the chicken reaches 165F. This should take another 4-8 minutes or so. Really depends on how big your chicken thigh pieces are. Remove the chicken from the baking sheet. Set aside.
You have a bit extra so snack on a piece or two if you must. I know I can never resist so I added an extra thigh to the recipe. Enjoy. Guilt free. If you aren't hungry they can go into the curry. Fine either way.
Make the chicken tikka jalfrezi
Heat the oil in a medium sized frying pan until the oil just starts to shimmer.
Add the onions and green peppers and stir every few seconds. Keep the peppers skin side down as much as you can. Fry until the pepper starts to blister and the onion edges turn brown.
Stir in the garlic ginger paste. Cook until the garlic ginger paste stops sputtering.
Turn your heat down to medium low and add your spice mix. This is why you need to use all the oil. You want to fry your spices. Too little oil and you risk your spices sticking or burning. Nothing you can do will fix burned spices.
It might look a little dry after frying the onions and peppers. You want the spices in oil. Not a dry paste. If it does look dry add a spash of oil immediately. Cook your spices for about 30 seconds.
Add the Indian hotel curry gravy. Stir it really well to get the oil to combine with the curry gravy. You want everything mixed together at this point. Bring to a simmer.
Cover loosely and cook for about 5 minutes.
Add the chicken tikka and the green chilies. Continue to cook for about 2 minutes to warm the chicken through. Add the tomatoes and cook another minute or so. At this point your sauce is going to be a little thick. Stir in a tablespoon or two of chicken stock or water to get the consistency you want. As much liquid as you need. This step is feel.
Taste. You have a decision to make. A 1/4 tsp of naga pickle mixed in at this point is a nice touch. It kicks the heat up though but it does add a distinctive flavour you can't get any other way. I like it both ways. Depends on my mood. The more classic jalfrezi leaves it out. Up to you.

Make the rice
Want perfect rice every time? Get a rice cooker. I don't like one trick kitchen appliances as a rule but I love my rice cooker. Something to think about...
If you have a rice cooker use it. Just combine the rice ingredients and proceed as you normally do. While the rice is cooking cook the chicken.
If you don't have a rice cooker this is an easy way to make basmati. You can pre-soak, rinse or whatever you want but this works pretty well as written. Blasphemy. I know. But it works. I did this for years until I got a rice cooker.
Pick a pan with a fairly tight fitting lid that's not way too big. Combine the water, chicken stock, green cardamom, cloves, cinnamon stick, salt and the rice in a saucepan.
Bring to a simmer over medium heat uncovered. Reduce heat to low and cover. Simmer for 20 minutes. Set a timer. Seriously. While this is going on make the chicken (see below).
When the timer goes off after 20 minutes, turn off the heat and let stand an additional 5 minutes. Uncover. Remove the whole spices. They should be just sitting on top. Party trick. Fluff gently and replace the cover to keep the rice warm.
Make the chicken
Make the biryani spice mix. Just combine all the ingredients in a small bowl. Dilute the tomato paste. Slice your shallots. Have everything at hand.
Heat the oil in a saute pan over medium heat. Add the shallots and cook until they start to brown. They will brown some more in the next couple steps.
Add the cumin seed. Cook for about 30 seconds.
Add the garlic ginger paste. Stir it into the oil and cook until it stops sputtering. Watch it. Don't let it burn.
Turn the heat to medium low. Add the spice mix. Stir to thoroughly combine the oil in the pan with the spices. Cook for about 30 seconds. Really watch it. There should be enough oil in the pan. If the spices start to stick turn down the heat and add a bit more oil.
Add the diluted tomato paste, stir and turn the heat up to medium. Cook about a minute.
Add the chicken and cook, stirring regularly until the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 150F. You want it mostly cooked. This It will finish cooking in the biryani.
Assemble the biryani
Use a pot that's about 9-10 inches in diameter. Make sure it has a pretty tight fitting lid.
Put a little more than half the rice in the pot and spread it out in an even layer. Top with the chicken. Add the rest of the rice. Top with the fried onions.
If you are using it, dissolve the saffron in a little water. Drizzle this over the top layer of rice.
Cover the pot with tinfoil and then the lid. The tinfoil adds a little extra seal. It's not quite as good as the dough seal in a traditional biryani but it will work well enough.
Transfer the biryani to the oven and bake for 15 minutes.
After the biryani has baked for 15 minutes remove it from the oven and place it on the stove. Let stand for 10 minutes.
To serve transfer the contents to a platter. It will get a bit messy. That's OK. The mix will look good, especially once you garnish it. It should look just like the pictures because that's exactly what I did.

Cook the tandoori seasoned chicken
Cut the chicken into bite sized pieces
Heat your frying pan (don't use non-stick) briefly over medium low heat. Add the oil and then 1 tsp tandoori masala.
Add the chicken and fry until it's all evenly coloured and partially cooked. This takes about 5 minutes. Don't worry. It will finish cooking in the curry.
Remove the chicken and set aside. Return the pan with the now seasoned oil to the stove over medium low heat.
Make the butter chicken
Add the onion and cook until well softened.
Turn the heat to medium. Add the garlic ginger paste and the green chili and cook, stirring constantly, until it stops sputtering.
Turn down the heat and add the spice mix. This is the critical step. Stir it constantly for 30 seconds. If it starts to darken lift the pan off the heat. You want the spice mix to cook in the oil but not burn.
Turn the heat up to medium high. This is important. The heat is what caramelizes the onion in the curry base and gives the curry it's Indian restaurant flavour. As you become more comfortable with this technique try pushing it. Add the diluted tomato paste and stir until bubbles form (the oil will likely separate). This takes around 30 seconds to one minute depending on the heat.
Add 3 oz of curry base. Stir until bubbles form (little craters really), around 30 seconds. Think lively boil. Watch the edges of the pan. The curry can stick here. Sticking is OK. Just scrape it back into the base. Burning is bad.
Now add 6 oz of curry base and stir briefly. Let it cook until the bubbles form again. This takes 1-2 minutes.
Add the rest of the curry base and let cook until the bubbles form.
Turn the heat down to low. Add the chicken, almond flour and sugar. Stir and simmer until the chicken is just done. This takes about another 5-6 minutes depending on how much you pre-cooked the chicken. Sneak a peek if you need to. Cut into a piece to see if it's done.
Let the curry simmer for about 5 minutes. If it gets too thick add a bit more curry base. Don't add water.
Remove from heat. Add the cream and butter if using.

Place the 2 cups of chopped onions in a microwave safe dish and cover loosely. Microwave at 70 percent until the onions are soft and translucent. This takes 10 minutes in my 1100 watt microwave. I can't predict how long it will take in yours...
Remove the onions from the microwave. Be careful. They will be hot. Let them cool slightly. Place the onions, 2 tbsp vegetable oil and 1 cup of warm water in a blender and puree until smooth. Set aside.
Chicken jalfrezi
In a small bowl, combine the mix powder, tandoori masala, Kashmiri chili powder, kasoor methi and salt. This is your spice mix.
Heat 4 tbsp vegetable oil in a pot over medium heat until it shimmers.
Add the green pepper, skin side down. Cook for about 2 minutes. Add the remaining chopped onion and continue to cook until the onion starts to brown on the edges and the green pepper scorches a bit. You really want the colour on the green pepper skin. It's key to the taste of a jalfrezi.
Add the garlic ginger paste and cilantro stems and cook until the garlic ginger paste stops spluttering.
Turn the heat to medium low. Add the spice mix and stir continuously until it starts to smell really good - around 30-40 seconds. Watch it carefully. If you burn the spices at this point you have to start over. It will stick a bit. That's OK - you will deglaze with the tomato mixture.
Add the diluted tomato paste and stir to combine. Turn the heat up to medium. Cook for 1 minute, scraping up any spice mix that stuck to the pan..
Add the onion paste and turn the heat up to medium high. Cook, stirring occasionally for about 4 minutes. It will darken a bit as it cooks. Don't worry if it seems a bit dry. The chicken will release juices as it cooks and you should be left with a nice amount of sauce.
Turn the heat down to medium low. Add the chicken and green chilies and stir. Cover and simmer until the chicken is done. It's done when you measure the internal temperature and it says 170F, about 12-15 minutes. An instant read thermometer is a handy thing to have here...
If the curry is a bit thick add a bit of water or chicken stock and stir. Add the cherry tomatoes. Let the chicken jalfrezi simmer another minute or so. Taste for salt and adjust as needed. It may be a bit under salted at this point.

Do yourself a favour and use a food processor if you have one. Peel and half the onions. Cut each half into six pieces. Fill your food processor about 2/3 full and pulse around 5-8 times. You should have diced onions. Repeat until you have chopped all the onions.
As long as your food processor is out use it to chop the tomatoes (if using fresh). Easy.
Heat the oil in a pot large enough to hold all the ingredients.
Add the oil and heat over medium heat.
Once the oil starts to shimmer add the cardamom, black peppercorns, cloves, cinnamon and optional Indian bay leaf.
Let the spices bubble for about 20 seconds and then add the onions.

Add the turmeric, cumin, coriander and kashmiri chili powder in a bowl. Add about a 1/2 cup of water and stir to make a slurry. You may need to add a bit more water. Doesn't matter.
Once the onions are this nice creamy brown mess add the garlic ginger paste. Stir to combine and continue to cook for about two minutes.
Add the powdered spice slurry and the salt. Cook another 3 minutes.
Add the chopped tomatoes, green chilies and cilantro. Simmer until the tomatoes are broken down. This takes about 10 minutes. The oil may have separated at this point. If it did, do NOT remove it. It's pure flavour.

Measure out your spices. Prep your chicken. Measure out a cup (237 ml) of Indian hotel curry gravy.
Remove the fresh methi leaves from the stems. Discard the stems. You want 1/2 cup of loosely packed methi leaves.
Make the methi chicken curry
Heat the oil in a medium sized frying pan over medium heat until the oil just starts to shimmer.
Add the cumin seeds. You want the oil hot enough that little bubbles form but not so hot you burn your cumin seeds. If it's too hot lift the pan from the heat and hope you were fast enough.
Stir in the garlic ginger paste. Gently fry until the garlic ginger paste stops sputtering. This can get a little messy.
Turn your heat down to medium low and add your spice mix. Cook for about 30 seconds. You want to fry your spices in the oil. Don't skimp on the oil. Bad things happen if the spices stick and burn. You cannot fix burned spices. Just start over if that happens.
Add the Indian hotel curry gravy. Stir it really well to get the oil to combine with the curry gravy. You want everything mixed together at this point. Bring to a simmer.
Stir in the fresh methi leaves.
Add the chicken thigh pieces in a single layer. Nestle them down into the sauce. Cover and ccok about 5 minutes. Remove the cover, flip the chicken and recover. Cook until the chicken is done. Use an instant read thermometer if you have one. You are shooting for an internal temperature of 160F. It will get to 170F as the curry finishes cooking.
Look at the consistency. You have a decision to make. If the chicken threw a lot of liquid the sauce might be right. If not, add a tablespoon or two of chicken stock and mix it in. Look again. If you are happy with it, cover and simmer for 2 minutes. If it's still too thick, add a bit more stock. I've never added more than a 1/4 cup.

Push the onion mixture to one side. You should have a puddle of oil in the pan. If you don't add a splash. You need this to cook the spices.
Turn down the heat to medium low. Add the whole spices, the curry leaf and the fresh green chilies. Cook for around 30 seconds.
Now add in the powdered spices. Stir those into the oil. You want them well coated in oil so they bloom. If it looks like the powdered will stick add a bit more oil. This is important. Cook for around 30-45 seconds.
Toss in the chickpeas and the water or stock and bring to a simmer. Cook, covered, for as long as it takes to get creamy chickpeas and a little body in the sauce. This will vary with the brand of chickpea. Somewhere between 20 and 60 minutes. Keep an eye on the water level. Add more as required. In the end you want your sauce to have a bit of texture so don't drown the chickpeas. You are going for around half the liquid volume you started with.
This is the part that's up to you. It's hard to predict how much green chili pickle flavour you will want. Remember you haven't added any salt yet so everything will taste a bit flat. There's salt in pickle and I don't know how much there is in the brand you picked.
Add 2-3 tsps of green chili pickle. Stir and taste. If you think it could use more taste add another tsp. Repeat until you get a flavour profile that works for you. I use 6 tsps for the brand I use (Mother's).

Pre-heat a small skillet over medium-low heat.
Measure out all the large spices (coriander seed, cinnamon bark, peppercorns, star anise arms, clove and green cardamon. Put those in one small bowl. These are the ""big"" spices. Measure out the cumin seed, poppy seed and ajwain into another bowl. These are the ""little spices"". Very scientific. I know.
Add the ""big"" spices. Toast, shaking the pan, until they start to get fragrant. This should take a minute or two.
Add the ""little"" spices and chilies and toast, shaking constantly, for another minute. Flip the chilies about half way through.
Let cool and grind to a fine powder. I like a coffee grinder for this. One of those ones with the blade.
Do your prep
Chop the onion. Measure out your spice mix (everything can go into one of the little bowls you used above). Grab your curry leaves. Prep your chicken. Measure out a cup (237 ml) of Indian hotel curry gravy.
Have your garlic ginger paste, tamarind and coconut milk handy. You're good to go now.
Make the chettinad chicken curry
Heat the oil in a medium sized frying pan until the oil just starts to shimmer.
Add the cassia bark. You should see little bubbles forming around it. Cook for about 30 seconds.
Add the onions. Cook the onions until they are fully translucent. If you can get the edges to brown a bit that's a good thing.
Stir in the garlic ginger paste. Gently fry until the garlic ginger paste stops sputtering. This is the only messy step.
Turn your heat down to medium low and add your spice mix and the curry leaves. Cook for about 30 seconds. You really want to fry your spices in the oil. Don't skimp on the oil. Bad things happen if the spices stick and burn.
Add the Indian hotel curry gravy. Stir it really well to get the oil to combine with the curry gravy. You want everything mixed together at this point. Bring to a simmer.
Add the chicken thigh pieces in a single layer. Nestle them down into the sauce. Cover and ccok about 5 minutes. Remove the cover, flip the chicken and recover. Cook until the chicken is done. Use an instant read thermometer if you have one. You are shooting for an internal temperature of 160F. It will get to 170F as the curry finishes cooking.
Add the tamarind paste and coconut milk.
Look at the consistency. If you are happy with it, cover and simmer for 2 minutes. If it's too thick, add a bit of water. If it's too thin don't cover it.

Pre-cook your chicken. Cut the chicken into large bite size pieces. Put them in a pan with enough chicken stock or water to cover. Add a bit of spice mix or curry powder and a pinch of salt. Simmer until just barely done. The chicken cooks again briefly in the gravy.
Pre-cook your potatoes. Cut them into pieces about the same size as the chicken. Add them to a small sauce pan and cover with well salted water. Bring to a simmer. The potatoes are done when a fork slides into them easily.
Make the spice mixes. Combine the restaurant spice mix, kashmiri chili powder, cinnamon and salt in one small bowl. This is your powdered spice mix. Combine the mustard seeds and panch phoran in another small bowl.
Combine 1 1/2 tablespoons of tomato paste with about 3 tablespoons of water.
Make the Bengali chicken curry
Heat your frying pan (don't use non-stick) briefly over medium heat. Add the oil.
Once the oil starts to shimmer add the panch phoran and mustard seed mix. You should see little bubbles forming around the spices. Cook 15-20 seconds.
Now add the garlic ginger paste. Cook, stirring constantly, until it stops sputtering. This should take 30 seconds or so.
Add the powdered spice mix. This is the critical step. Stir it constantly for 30 seconds. If it starts to darken lift the pan off the heat. You want the spice mix to cook in the oil but not burn. You can go a little longer if you want. Really cook out the spices. Just be careful. Burnt spices are not tasty.
Turn the heat up to medium high. This is important. The heat is what caramelizes (maillard reaction really) the onions in the curry base and gives the curry it's Indian restaurant flavour. As you become more comfortable with this technique try pushing it. Add the diluted tomato paste and stir until bubbles form (the oil will likely separate). This takes around 30 seconds to one minute depending on the heat.
Add around 3 oz of curry base (you don't need to be super precise here). Stir until bubbles form (little craters really), around 30 seconds. Think lively boil. Watch the edges of the pan. The curry can stick here. Sticking is OK. Just scrape it back into the base. Burning is bad.
Now add 6 oz of curry base and stir briefly. Let it cook until the bubbles form again. This takes 1-2 minutes.
Add the rest of the curry base and let cook until the bubbles form. Turn the heat down to low and add the pre-cooked chicken and potatoes.
Let the curry simmer for about 5 minutes. If it gets too thick add a bit more curry base. Don't add water.

Combine the lentils, water and turmeric in a pot large enough to hold the final curry. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer until the lentils are mushy. You want to bring them to a boil uncovered and then cover when you reduce to a simmer. I've had lentils boil over more times than I care to mention. Messy stuff.
Give them a stir every now and then while they cook. Sometimes they stick to the bottom a bit right when they get to the mush stage. Keep an eye on them. They will cook more with the chicken. Ultimately you want the lentils to fully disintegrate. A little thick at this stage is OK. The chicken will throw some liquid as it cooks.
Prepare the seasoning masala or tempering
Heat the oil over medium heat in a skillet. Add the cinnamon and cook until little bubbles form around it. This takes 20-30 seconds.
Now add the mustard seed, panch phoran and cumin seed. Cook until they start to sizzle. Again, this takes only a few seconds.
Reduce the heat to medium low and add the diced green chili. Cook for 30-45 seconds.
Stir in the garlic ginger paste and cook until it stops sputtering - around one minute. Now add the kashmiri chili powder and salt and cook for 20-30 seconds, stirring continuously.
Mix in the diced tomatoes. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 3-4 minutes. You want to get them to where they are just starting to lose their shape.
Add the tomato mixture to the lentils. Stir to combine. Taste and adjust salt. It's easier now than when the chicken is in your way.
Add the chicken to the lentil mixture. Cook until the chicken is cooked through. An instant read thermometer is good for this. You are going for about 170F in the middle of the thigh.

Make your spice mix. Pre-cook the lamb.
DIlute your curry gravy with 1/4 cup of water (the same 1/4 as in the ingredient list - don't dilute it twice). You need to dilute it because the lamb is going in pre-cooked. That probably doesn't make sense to you if you haven't made a chicken hotel curry yet. Just do it. It will work out.
Pre-cook the lamb
Add the lamb, curry powder, salt and chicken stock to a saucepan. You want enough stock to fully cover the lamb. 1 cup is a guess. I don't know how big your sauce pan is. Try to pick one that isn't way too big.
Bring to a simmer. Cook until the lamb is tender. This should take somewhere around an hour for lamb shoulder. Depends on how big your lamb chunks are. Also depends on the lamb. You are making stew. It's done when it's done I'm afraid.
Drain. Discard the stock (it will be very salty) and set the lamb aside. You can do this the day before if you'd like.
Make the lamb madras
Heat the oil in a medium sized frying pan until the oil just starts to shimmer.
Add the cassia bark. You should see little bubbles forming around it. Cook for about 30 seconds.
Add the diced shallots. Cook until they just start to colour up.
Stir in the garlic ginger paste. Gently fry until the garlic ginger paste stops sputtering. This is the only messy step.
Turn your heat down to medium low and add your spice mix. This is why you added 3 tablespoons of oil. You really want to fry your spices in the oil. Skimp on the oil and you risk your spices sticking or worse, burning. If your spices burn here you are starting over. No way around this.
Add the Indian hotel curry gravy. Stir it really well to get the oil to combine with the curry gravy. You want everything mixed together at this point. Bring to a simmer.
Add the tamarind paste, the cconut milk and the lamb.
Cover loosely and cook for about 5 minutes.
Taste the curry. If you can take the heat, add the chili pickle. A little goes a long way but it really makes a difference in flavour too.
If the sauce looks a little thick at this point add a bit of water and bring back to a gentle simmer. Cook for another two or three minutes. You want some of the lamb flavour to infuse the sauce.

Be ready. This goes fast. Minutes. Literally
Beat your eggs. Set aside.
Use a wok if you have one. Or a really big skillet. For this dish non-stick is easier. I like carbon steel or aluminum for this. You want a pan that heats and cools quickly.
You are going to want to really play with your heat. This is easiest on a gas stove but it works on electric as well. Just slide the pan off the heat when you need it to cool down a bit.
Heat the oil over medium heat high. Add the chicken and stir fry until it starts to brown. It should be done by then but sneak a peak to make sure. Cut a piece in half and look. No harm in that.
Turn the heat down to medium low. Add the garlic and the nam prik pao (the Thai chili paste - not the fish sauce and chilies). Stir fry briefly. Watch it. A bit brown is OK. Burned is not.
Add the rice and crank the heat. Full blast at this point. You want the rice to get a toasty flavour. Toss it around. Push it up the sides. Keep it moving. Cook it this way for about 90 seconds. Maybe longer if you are waiting for your electric element to heat up.
Add the pak choy if using during the last 30 seconds or so. It cooks quickly.
Turn the heat down to medium. Push the rice to the sides and pour the eggs into the pan. Scramble them until just done.
The rice that is at the bottom of the pan will crisp up a bit. Like a soffrito in a paella. I like this. If you don't keep the rice moving as best you can while you scramble the eggs. It's near impossible but if you want to try go for it. Can't hurt.

Slice your shallots in half. Put them in a cast iron pan, cut side down, over medium heat. Add the garlic. Dry roast until the shallots start to char. While that's happening flip the garlic every minute or so.
When the shallots are charred (check them - there's no other way) flip them over. Keep flipping your garlic. When it's all soft remove from heat and let cool. Remove the peels on both the garlic and shallot.
Combine all the ingredients except the oil.
Now the fight starts. It is not easy to puree this stuff. You can use a small food processor. That works. Kind of. Or you can grind manually in a mortar and pestle. That works better.
Sometimes, when I'm using a food processor I give up and add the oil into the mix. Technically you are supposed to fry the paste in oil. But I find when you start cooking it off some of the oil comes out. And your goal is to get the oil into the paste anyway.
Once you have pureed it pour the oil (if you haven't already added it to the paste) into a small frying pan and heat over medium low heat.
When the oil starts to shimmer add the paste and fry, stirring regularly, for about 4-5 minutes. It will darken a bit and start to give off quite a rich aroma. When you get the aroma it's done. You will get it when you get there.
Alternately, If you added the oil to get the paste to puree transfer it to a dry pan and cook over medium low heat as above.

This is a little tricky. Take your time. Thread a piece of pork onto a skewer. Now skewer a piece of green onion. Repeat with another piece of pork and another piece of green onion. Finish with a third piece of pork. Repeat this until all the pork is skewered. You should get 10-12 skewers.
Heat your grill to somewhere between medium and medium low. Give yourself a cool safety zone. You are effectively grilling unsmoked bacon here. It's going to flare up a lot.
Grill no more than 6 skewers at a time. This isn't the place to be a hero. You are going to burn your skewers badly if try to do them all at once. Trust me. I tried to be a hero. Epic fail.
It's too hard to get internal temperature on little bits of pork belly. So you need to trust your instincts a bit. It doesn't take long to cook through. Depending on your fire you could be looking at as little as 3-5 minutes. Could be longer but not crazy long. Be careful. Look at the pictures. Try one to see.
You don't want to overcook them. Pork belly is touchy. You need to cook it until just done. Cook it longer and it gets tough. Really tough. Like I wish I'd braised it tough. Not good.
As you pull the pork belly skewers off the grill give them a good dip in the sterilized marinade.
To serve you can go a few different directions. These skewers make great party food. Serve them with a little of the marinade as a dipping sauce. Maybe put them on a platter and drizzle the marinade overtop. Pass them around like that. Or serve them up as lettuce wraps. Skewers on lettuce with marinade drizzled overtop is good eating.",en-US,5.0,,glebe kitchen,90,12 serving(s),6 g,237 kcal,10 g,4 g,20 g,7 g,27 mg,357 mg,9 g,1 g,,

Warm a small skillet over medium low heat. Add the coriander seed and peppercorns. Toast, stirring constantly until they just start to get aromatic. This takes about a minute.
Add the cumin seed and toast until everything smells great. This takes another 30 seconds or so.
Let cool. Transfer to a spice grinder and grind to a powder.
Combine the remaining ingredients (except the bird's eye chilies) in a small blender or food processor. This isn't a lot of stuff so either double the recipe and reserve half or use a small blender. You will need to add some or all the vegetable oil to get it to puree.
Note that this is best done in a small food processor. And it is real work. You will need to scrape down the bowl a few times to get it. Takes a few minutes. But it's way easier than using a mortar and pestle.
Taste the paste. If you can take the heat add a chopped bird's eye chili. Puree. Taste again. If you don't think it's crazy hot add another one. Keep going until you think it's crazy hot. Don't worry. The coconut milk tames everything. Crazy hot at this point should be just right for your tastes in the final curry.
Make the Thai green curry
Grab a wok or a large skillet. Add the thick coconut milk (the stuff floating on the top of the can) and bring to a lively simmer. Let it go until the cream starts to break. You will see oil separating. This oil is what you will fry the curry paste in.
This doesn't always work. At least it doesn't always work for me. I think it has to do with how thick the coconut cream is. Sometimes it's almost solid. Other times its more like whipping cream. It's not a big deal in this recipe because there is already some oil in the paste. I usually give up after 6 or 7 minutes. If it hasn't split by that point give up.
Once you see the oil or give up add the curry paste and stir to combine. Cook, stirring, until the paste loses it's pungent raw smell. It will smell mostly of the shallots at first. You are done when that smell is gone. This takes about 5 minutes.
Mix in the chicken and cook until the chicken is coloured. Add the remaining coconut milk. Simmer 5 minutes.
Add the quartered Thai eggplant, kaffir lime leaf and fish sauce. Cook until the chicken is done, another 15 minutes or so.
Add the basil and cook one minute more. Taste for salt. You may need a little more. You may not. Up to you.

Soak the rice noodles in fairly hot water for 30-45 minutes. They will turn white but still be quite firm. You want them a little toothy. Not hard. Just toothy. Pliable. 85 percent of the way there. Start checking them after about 20 minutes. This is important.
While the noodles are soaking, do your prep. Chop your vegetables. Cut the chicken into 3/4 inch cubes. Peel your shrimp if using.
Chop your peanuts. I like a mini food processor. You don't want to make peanut butter but you don't want huge pieces of peanut either. If you don't have a mini food processor chop by hand. It takes a while but you'll get there.
Combine the fish sauce, brown sugar, tomato paste, tamarind and sambal oelek. Stir to combine. This is your pad Thai sauce.

Turn the heat way down. If you're cooking on electric just slide it off the burner. Add garlic and cook, stirring, for another 30 seconds. You don't want the garlic to burn. It gets bitter. That's no good.
Crank the heat to max. Mix in the noodles. Stir to coat the noodles with oil. Cook about 45-60 seconds, stirring constantly. Be careful not to break the noodle strands. At this point you want the noodles just done right. Try one to see.

Season generously with salt and coarse black pepper
Roast the chicken, legs facing the rear of the oven for 15-20 minutes. Baste with pan drippings.
Continue roasting the chicken, turning occasionally to ensure the chicken roasts evenly, until the breast reaches an internal temperature of 165F and the legs reach 175F, about 25-30 minutes more. Remove from oven, place chicken on a cutting board with a groove to catch the juices and let rest while you cook the noodles.
Spoon off 4 Tbsp chicken fat and reserve to cook the noodles. Spoon off the rest of the fat (discard), place the pan over medium heat and add the chicken stock. Scrape up the little bits in the bottom of the pan and stir to get them to dissolve. Lower heat to as low as your stove will go.

You don't have this (I don't think) so a bit of extra work is a necessary evil here.
Combine all the sauce ingredients in a small bowl. Set aside.
Prep your beef. If using sirloin a small roast (or baseball steak) works well. Put the sirloin in the freezer for about 20 minutes and then slice about as think as you can get (1/8"") across the grain. If you are using flank or skirt slice on the vertical bias (so the slice is bigger than the steak is high).
Use a wok for this if you can. It's just easier. A big frying pan will do as well. Pre-heat it over medium high heat. Add 2 tablespoon of the oil.
Turn the heat up to high. Crank it. When the oil starts to shimmer (that should happen fast) add half of the beef. Half is important. You don't want to overload your pan. You'll get steam if you do that and your beef won't brown. Cook, tossing frequently, until it gets some colour. Remove.
Add the remaining tablespoon of oil. Add the remaining beef and cook you did with the first half. Set aside.
Turn the heat down to medium. If your wok looks dry at this point add a bit more oil. Add the onions and cook until they are well softened.
Turn up the heat. Add the broccolini and stir fry until it starts to soften. Be vigorous. Toss stuff around. Like you were on TV. Have fun with it. This takes a couple minutes or more depending on how high your heat is.
You want to try to get a bit of that charred flavour on the broccolini. Push it hard. Your onions will start to really shrink and darken. Like fried shallots. That's good. After about two minutes if the onions are getting too dark add a couple tablespoons of water to the wok to cook things down a bit.
Turn the heat down to medium and add the garlic ginger paste. Cook for about 30 seconds, then add the beef back into the wok.
Add the sauce and toss until everything is warmed through. Add the cornstarch-water mixture and simmer until the sauce just starts to cling to the broccolini. Taste. If you think it isn't salty enough let it cook another minute to concentrate the flavours a bit. Remove from heat. Add the red chilies if using.

Bring the chicken stock to a simmer over medium low heat in a pot that is large enough to hold the stock, chicken and ultimately noodles.
Poach the chicken thighs until they reach an internal temperature of 175F. Use an instant read thermometer. Always use an instant read thermometer. This should take about 25 minutes.
Remove the chicken thighs. Set aside to cool enough to handle. Pull the chicken off the bones. You want bite size chunks. Reserve.
Strain the stock if you are worried about little bits floating around in it. Not a big deal, though. Nothing wrong with little bits. Return the stock to the pot.
Combine the gochujang, doenjang if using, miso and gochugaru in a small bowl. Add a bit of hot chicken stock to the bowl and stir to combine. You want to do it this way. If you just add the flavouring to the big pot you are going to be chasing bits of gochujang around the pot for an hour. Trust me.
Add the gochujang stock mixture to the remaining stock in the pot. Stir in the fish sauce. Taste. Adjust salt if needed. Your broth is ready.
Medium boiled eggs
In a medium saucepan, bring water to a boil. Boil large eggs for 6 minutes 30 seconds. If using extra large eggs boil them for 7 minutes 30 seconds. You may have to adjust your times slightly depending on the exact size of your eggs but this should get you pretty close.
Submerge the eggs in really cold or ice water to chill. This stops the egg yolks from continuing to set up. Peel and set aside. They will warm up in the broth.
Carefully cut the eggs in half lengthwise right before you serve. The yolk is still a bit runny so use a sharp knife.
Korean ramen
Bring the Korean ramen broth to a boil. Add the noodles and cook until done. Follow the instructions on the noodle package. Return the chicken to the broth to warm through. Slice the eggs lengthwise.

You should have 6 or so lbs of pork neck bones in total. Some will be meatier than others. Keep those for the soup. You will need to blanch and rinse all the pork so you might as well do it all up front.

Bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover loosely and simmer for 4-5 hours. Longer is better if you have the time.
Strain the stock into a clean pot large enough to hold the remaining pork, potatoes and cabbage. You should have about 5-6 cups. If you have less, add water to get to 6 cups.

Combine all the ingredients except the apple juice or water. Stir to combine thoroughly.
Use the apple juice or water to thin to the desired consistency. You want it pretty thick but you also want to be able to spread it out a bit in your wrap. Like hoisin sauce if you are familiar with that.
Make the beef bulgogi
Beef, sliced against the grain, is fundamental here. Buy a small roast. Chuck it in the freezer for about 20-30 minutes. That makes things easier. Use your sharpest knife. Slice against the grain. You are trying for about 1/8 of an inch thick. It's not dead easy but it's not that hard either...
Heat half the oil in a large skillet until it shimmers. Season the beef with a bit of salt. Add half the beef to the pan. Resist the urge to start stirring right away. Give it a minute to brown a bit. Give it a stir and cook about another minute. Remove from the pan and set aside. It doesn't have to be fully cooked at this point. It will cook a bit more in the sauce.
Repeat with the rest of the oil and remaining beef. If you get a bit of browning in the pan be happy. That's fond. You will scrape that goodness up when you add the bulgogi sauce. More flavour. More better!
Return the first half of the beef to the pan and the bulgogi sauce. If you are lucky enough to have some fond, scrape it up so it melts into the sauce. Cook over high heat, uncovered, until most of the liquid has evaporated. This takes about 2-3 minutes.
Serve with lettuce, ssamjang, and condiments. Place a bit of rice (or not) on a lettuce leaf. Top with a bit of beef. Add a light drizzle of ssamjang and sprinkle with whatever condiments you like.

Pre-heat your broiler. Coat the ribs with a bit of vegetable oil and lay them out in a single layer on a broiler safe sheet pan. Broil until lightly browned. Rotate the sheet pan to make sure they brown evenly. When they look good, flip them and repeat. Remove from the oven. Set your oven to 325F.
Braise the ribs
Heat the vegetable oil in a large dutch oven over medium low heat. Add the onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until translucent. This takes about 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook another 30 seconds. Reduce heat to low.
Mix in the gochugaru, gochujang, shiro miso, mirin, soy, apricot jam and sesame oil. Stir to combine.
Add the chicken stock and bring to a simmer.
Add the ribs to the dutch oven. Stir. The liquid won't cover the ribs. That's OK. Resist the urge to add more stock. Put a sheet of aluminium foil over the dutch oven and cover tightly. Place the pot in the pre-heated oven.
After 30 minutes, remove the pot. Using tongs, move some of the submerged ribs up. Move the ones that were on the top down. Basically mix them up. Replace the foil and lid and return to oven.
Continue to cook for another 30-40 minutes. Check at 30 minutes. They should be fork tender but if they aren't cook them another 10 minutes. Cook them until they are tender. Tender doesn't mean mush. Mush is bad. Tender means they pull away cleanly from the bone. Maybe a little tug to get them off but the bone winds up clean.
Remove the pot from the oven. Remove the ribs to a bowl and tent with foil.
Put the sauce in a large cup or fat separator and spoon off the fat. Return the sauce to the pot. Over medium heat, reduce the sauce until it's fairly thick - like a thin BBQ sauce. This should only take around 5-8 minutes if you resisted the urge to add more liquid while cooking.
Return the ribs to pot and toss in the sauce. Garnish with sesame seeds. Serve with rice and a nice green salad. Or forget the sides and just mow down on ribs.",en-US,4.8,,glebe kitchen,100,6 serving(s),6 servings,1333 kcal,20 g,70 g,106 g,35 g,348 mg,951 mg,9 g,1 g,,

Heat one inch of vegetable oil in a wok or cast iron pan. Alternately prepare your deep fryer. The target temperature is 375F but anywhere between 350F and 400F is OK. The chicken is already cooked. This is all about crisping up the skin.
Thoroughly combine the flour, corn starch, salt and baking soda.

Fry the chicken wings in batches. If you are brave, just slip the chicken into the oil with your hands. If you aren't brave, use tongs. Tongs are more cumbersome but they works fine.
Fry the chicken to colour them. They are already cooked. The frying is all about getting the coating right. That's the beauty of this recipe. It takes about 3 minutes for them to colour up nicely.

Combine
In a large bowl, place the chopped chicken and add rice wine, onion powder, garlic powder, salt, ginger powder, and ground black pepper. Combine them well. Set aside.
Dredge
Place the corn starch in a large bowl. Dredge the seasoned chicken pieces in the corn starch and evenly coat them.
Deep Fry
In a deep saucepan (or fryer) add a generous amount of oil and heat it until the oil temperature reaches 175 C / 347 F. Start adding the chicken carefully and fry them until they cook. (It takes 4 to 5 mins depending on the size of chicken). Do not overcrowd the pan, and cook in batches if needed. (It might be useful to use a grease splatter screen if you have one as it minimises oil splatter.)
Twice Deep Fry
Take out the cooked chicken and place them onto some kitchen paper to soak up excess oil. Quickly scoop out any floating debris from the oil using a skimmer. Deep fry the chicken again when the oil temperature reaches 175 C / 347 F. Fry them until the batter is golden and crisp. (The second time frying is shorter than the first time, 2 to 3 mins.) Set aside.
Make Sauce
In a separate pan, combine all the sauce ingredients. Bring it to boil over medium low heat while stirring often. Once the sauce starts bubbling, take out the chilies and green onion pieces. In a separate bowl, combine and mix the slurry ingredients then pour it over the sauce. Stir often. Once the sauce thickens or turns to glaze (within 1 – 2 mins), remove from the heat and cool down for 5 mins.
Baste
Place the double fried chicken onto the lined baking sheet, then using a cooking brush, gently baste the chicken with the sauce. Once all the chicken is coated with the sauce, garnish with sesame seeds and green onions. Serve.
Air Fryer Method (Frying Only)
Spray cooking oil on air fryer basket.
Line Up
Place the chicken pieces, without overlapping, onto the basket. Spray some oil lightly over the chicken pieces. (While it is optional, chicken browns better with extra oil coating.)
Air Fry

(A pot with a long handle is a great option as you can filter the oil easier later on.)
Add in the garlic, ginger, green onion into a wide base saucepan or sauté pan.

Depending on your stove type, it will be between 5 to 10 mins to reach this point. Another sign you could use is by splashing a small amount (about 2 tsp) of boiled oil over the Korean chili flakes. If the temperature is high enough, the chili flakes will make some sizzling bubbles. Turn the heat off.
Scoop out the aromatic vegetables using a slotted spoon or tongs and discard. Or strain them while pouring the oil over the chili flakes (from step 1) in a few batches. It will make small sizzling bubbles initially then die down as it cools. Stir around the chili flakes and oil to mix them well. Steep the chili flakes for 15 mins and allow it to bring out the flavor and color.
Filter the oil using a funnel and filter paper and transfer the chili oil into a sterilized glass jar.

Combine the sauce ingredients – ketchup, soy sauce, Tonkatsu sauce, honey, water and milk in a bowl or large measuring cup. Set aside.
Preheat a frying pan and add the cooking oil and flour. Cook over medium to medium high heat until the liquid turns dark brown. It takes about 5 to 7 minutes. Stir occasionally. Reduce the heat to low.
Pour the sauce in from step 1 and stir well. Bring up the heat and cook over medium low to medium heat until the sauce thickens (about 8-10 minutes). Stir often. Set aside.
FRIED RICE
Preheat a skillet and add some cooking oil. Stir fry carrot, onion, green bell pepper and smoked ham until all ingredients are cooked.
Add the rice and the rice seasoning and mix them well for 1 to 2 minutes.
Turn the heat off. Cover with foil or a lid to keep the rice warm while getting other ingredients ready.
When ready to serve, shape the rice in a small bowl to make mounds of rice. Place the serving plate on the bowl and flip. Remove the bowl.
TORNADO OMELETTE
Beat the eggs in a bowl. To give a smooth texture, sieve through the eggs. (This is also one of the key points for success as it makes the omelette turn smoothly). Add a pinch of salt.
Preheat a non-stick frying pan over medium high heat. (It should be heated well enough for the egg to bubble up when you pour it in.) Add some cooking oil and spread it all over the pan.
Pour the beaten egg onto the pan and cook it until the edge (about 3 mm / 0.12 inch) is cooked. But an easier telltale is when the omelette starts forming air bubbles in the middle of the pan. You should look for a bit larger sized bubbles.
Hold one wooden chopstick in each hand diagonally to yourself and push the egg from the edge towards the centre while maintaining about 4 to 5 cm (1.5-2 inch) gap between each chopstick, and start twirling your chopsticks in one direction. Holding diagonal instead of parallel to yourself will give you more room to turn the egg. Swap the chopstick holding hands in between twirling to be able to keep turning and to make the tornado egg smoothly. Cook the omelette until it’s about 95% cooked. (If the omelette is fully cooked, it’s hard to keep the tornado shape as it might break in the centre.)
Hold the chopsticks with one hand and slowly slide the omelette from the pan onto the shaped rice.
Pour the demi-glace sauce (or ketchup if you didn’t make the sauce) and serve.
OVAL SHAPE OMELETTE
Beat the eggs in a bowl. To give a smooth texture, sieve through the eggs. Add a pinch of salt.
Preheat a non-stick frying pan over medium high heat. Add some cooking oil.
Reduce the heat to medium and pour the beaten egg in the pan. Quickly spread the egg and make a thin, large, and round omelette.
Once the omelette is 85% cooked, place one serving of fried rice in the middle of the omelette and spread well.
Fold around the edge of the omelette toward the rice, providing a short blanket.
Slowly slide and flip the egg from the pan onto the serving plate. Or place the serving plate on the omelette rice and flip the pan. Ensure there’s no residual oil in the pan to avoid an accidental burn.
Use cooking foil (or cooking paper) to shape the omelette into an oval shape. Watch out as the omelette rice can be hot.

Gather all the ingredients.
Carefully wash the sweet potatoes (Don’t peel the skin). Cut the sweet potatoes diagonally while rotating the sweet potato a quarter between cuts. This Japanese cutting technique is called “Rangiri”.
Put the sweet potatoes in 8 cups water and add 2 tsp salt. Soak for 15 minutes to remove starch.
Add the oil in the medium pot (I use a 2.75-QT Staub) and bring it to 320ºF (160ºC) (Use a cooking thermometer helps!). Meanwhile, dry the sweet potatoes with the kitchen towel (or paper towel).
When the oil has reached 320ºF (160ºC), add the sweet potatoes (half of them) into the oil and deep fry. Do not crowd the pot and fry in batches (I do twice).
Deep fry until golden brown, about 10 minutes.
When it's golden brown, insert a wooden skewer to make sure it goes through. Transfer to a wire rack or a paper towel to drain the oil.
To make candy (syrup), combine 5 Tbsp sugar, 1 ½ Tbsp water, and 1 Tbsp Mirin in a large frying pan off the heat. Put on the stove and bring it to boil on medium heat.
Once the mixture is bubbling, add 1 tsp vinegar and 1 tsp soy sauce.
Reduce the mixture, stirring constantly, until the right consistency. When you can draw a line on the pan, add the sweet potatoes.
Turn off the heat and coat the sweet potatoes with syrup. Sprinkle black sesame seeds (once the candy is hardened, sesame seeds won't stick to the surface, so do it while candy is soft).
Serve on a plate or bowl. Enjoy!
#2 Steam & Shallow-Fry Version
Gather all the ingredients.
Carefully wash the sweet potatoes (Don’t peel the skin).
Cut the sweet potatoes diagonally while rotating the sweet potato a quarter between cuts. This Japanese cutting technique is called “Rangiri”.
Soak sweet potatoes in water for 15 minutes to remove starch.
Do not heat the frying pan yet. Add sugar, oil, soy sauce and rice vinegar in the pan and combine all together.
Dry the sweet potatoes completely with paper towel and place in the pan.
Wrap the frying pan’s lid with kitchen cloth. This is to prevent condensation on the lid dripping into sweet potatoes while cooking.
Cover with the lid and turn on the heat to medium.
When you hear bubbling sound from the pan, turn the heat to low to medium-low, and set timer for 2 minutes. Open the lid and flip the sweet potatoes every 2-3 minute so that all sides will have nice golden brown color and get flavored.
Depends on the size of sweet potatoes, the cooking time varies, cook for 8-10 minutes or until an inserted skewer goes through smoothly (I personally prefer it a bit tougher than completely soft texture).

To Make Dough
Using the fine mesh strainer, sift the flour into a large bowl. Combine hot water, oil, and kosher salt.
Mix the dry ingredients and wet ingredients with chopsticks until you can pick up the dough with hands.
Use the dough to pick up crumbs in the bowl.
Knead on a lightly floured surface for about 3 minutes, until a smooth dough forms. In Japan, we say “knead until the texture is like your earlobe”.
Form the dough into a ball, put it back in the bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let it rest at room temperature for at least 30 minutes or longer. Letting the dough rest increases its elasticity making it easier to work with later, so please don't skip.
To Make Eggplant Filling
While the dough rests, make the fillings. Remove the eggplant stem and cut it half vertically. Then slice into half circles. Soak in water for 5-10 minutes (Meanwhile, you can cut Kabocha). Drain well and set aside.
Heat sesame oil in a large frying pan and sauté eggplant until it is coated with oil. Cover the lid and cook on low heat for 5 minutes.
When tender, add sugar and combine well.
Add miso and julienned shiso leaves, and mix well together. Transfer to a dish to let cool.
To Make Kabocha Filling
Cut the kabocha into smaller wedges and remove the skin (See How To Cut a Kabocha Squash).
Cut each wedge into thin slices and then cut into thin strips.
Heat the oil in the frying pan and sauté the kabocha. When it’s coated with oil, add water and cook covered for 5 minutes on low heat.
Add sugar and combine well.
Add soy sauce and pinch of salt. Mix well together.
Transfer to the dish to let cool.
To Shape into Oyaki
Roll out the rested dough into a rectangular or circle shape and divide it into 12 pieces.
Make each dough into a ball then press down with your hand.
Stretch the dough to 10 cm (4 inches) in diameter. The important trick is to keep the center thicker than the edges. Using your fingers, stretch the outer edges by rotating the dough. This way, when you pinch the dough to seal, the dough won’t be too thick/too much.
Place about 1 Tbsp of the filling in the center of each piece of dough. Close the oyaki by bringing the dough up over the filling, pinching at the top to seal.
I use the same pleating technique as my Nikuman recipe (see the video on how I close the dough and pinch).
After pinching the dough, put the pinched-side down on a lightly floured surface and twist a few times. Then press the top of the oyaki a little bit into a slightly flat ball.
To Cook Oyaki
Set a steamer ready, by placing a steamer basket on top of wok/pot filled with enough boiling water. If you don’t have a steamer, after cooking the oyaki in a frying pan, add ¼ cup water to the pan. Cover with a lid and steam it until the water evaporates.
Heat the oil in a frying pan (12 inch) and cook oyaki, pinched-side down.
Pan fry for 3-4 minutes each side, or until golden brown.
Transfer the oyaki to a steamer basket and cover to cook on high heat for 15-20 minutes (depending on the size of the oyaki and filling – small one should take about 10 minutes). Make sure the lid is covered with the kitchen towel so condensation on the lid doesn’t fall onto the oyaki.
When they are done steaming, transfer to a wire rack (I use a bamboo strainer) where the heat can escape from the bottom.
To Serve and Store

To Prepare Fruits
Remove the core of strawberries.
Cut off both ends and peel the skin of the kiwis.
Cut off both ends of the navel orange. Remove the peel. Carefully peel off the segment wall and get each segment out.
Using a paper towel, remove the moisture of the fruits.
To Make Whipped Cream
Prepare a large bowl of iced water and place a medium bowl inside the larger bowl to keep cool. Make sure the bowl is clean and dry. Add the heavy whipping cream and start whisking on low speed.
Once bubbly, add sugar and rum (if you are using) and start whisking on medium-high speed.
The cream will be thicker as you whip.
When you lift the whisk out of the cream and shows peaks, remove the bowl from the ice bath and switch to a hand whisk. Whisk until you achieve the right consistency. Check the consistency of the whipped cream as you whisk. It should be spreadable but not runny because it goes between the sandwich bread.
Now spread the whipped cream on both sides of the sandwich bread. If there is any leftover whipped cream, you can dip your fruits or make Fruit Parfait. I prefer to keep the crust on the bread until the end. When you put fruits between two slices of the bread, the crust helps to keep it in shape.
Only on one side of the sandwich bread, align the fruits. I plan to cut the sandwich diagonally. Think carefully about how you want to show your cross section. I recommend taking a picture of the alignment of the fruits and don’t change the orientation of the sandwich.
Put the whipped cream to fill in any gap between fruits.
Put the second slices of sandwich bread over the fruits, facing the whipped cream side down.
Prepare plastic wrap, large enough to wrap the sandwich tightly from all four sides. Remember, don’t change the orientation of the sandwich.
Mark the cross section over the plastic wrap with a pen.
Put the sandwiches between plates and refrigerate for at least one hour (up to overnight). In Japan, putting weight on the sandwich is a pretty standard method prior to cutting in half.
Open the plastic wrap and cut the sandwich in half diagonally with a clean knife. Keep it closed (Don’t open the sandwich to show cross section yet). Clean the knife with a hot wet towel before each cut.
Gently press down the sandwich and cut off the 4 edges.
Now the cross section is revealed for the first time!
Serve immediately. If you plan to transfer the sandwich, make sure to keep it chilled all times.

To Dry Mochi (7-10 Days Before Frying)
Cut kirimochi into small pieces and ⅛ inch (3 mm) thickness. Lay the mochi pieces in a single layer on a flat tray or wire rack.
Allow them to air dry with good ventilation for at least one week. As mochi pieces dehydrate, they might break into smaller pieces so try not to touch. The surface of mochi pieces will be cracked and flaky and the texture will be harder.
Another option: I haven't tried this method, but I've read that you can alternatively bake the mochi pieces at 400ºF (200ºF) for 15 mins. For a convection oven, reduce cooking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC). You can lightly brush oil and season with salt (so the salt will stick to the rice crackers).
To Cook Rice Crackers
In a frying pan (I use a cast-iron skillet), add the oil to about ¾ inch (2 cm) deep and heat it to 340ºF (170ºC). Add a few pieces of mochi pieces first. If small bubbles start to appear around the mochi, then add more pieces in a single layer, keeping some space in between as they pop and expand. The mochi pieces will turn white and puff up.
Turn over each piece and cook until mochi pieces are popped and lightly golden brown. Increase heat so the oil is 350ºF (180ºC) and fry till mochi pieces are golden brown.
Remove the mochi pieces from the oil and place a wire rack or a plate lined with paper towels. While they are hot, season with salt.
Optionally, you can sprinkle furikake or brush soy sauce (adjust the amount of salt if you use soy sauce).

To Prepare Fillings
Grind ¼ cup katsuobushi (bonito flakes) into a fine powder. Set aside, we'll use this powder when we're cooking Takoyaki.
Cut green onions into fine slices and mince 1 Tbsp red pickled ginger.
Cut the octopus into ½ inch (1.3 cm) bite-size pieces (cut into smaller pieces for kids so they can chew easily). I use ""rangiri"" cutting technique.
To Make Takoyaki Batter
In a large mixing bowl, combine 1 cup (120 g) all-purpose flour, 2 tsp baking powder, and ½ tsp kosher salt and whisk all together.
Add 2 large eggs, 1 tsp soy sauce, and 1 ½ cup (360 ml) dashi.
Whisk all together until well-blended and transfer the batter to a 2-cup measuring cup with a handle (or any other pitcher with a spout for easy pouring).
To Cook Takoyaki
Heat the takoyaki pan to 400ºF (200ºC) over medium heat. Using a brush, generously oil the takoyaki pan (both the holes and connecting flat areas). When you see smoke coming from the pan, pour the batter to fill the holes. It’s okay for the batter to slightly overflow the holes. Usually, as you add ingredients to the batter it will overflow.
Add 1-3 octopus pieces in each hole depending on its size and sprinkle katsuobushi powder you ground earlier on top.
Then sprinkle tenkasu, green onion, and pickled red ginger.
After 3 minutes or so, when the bottom of the balls has hardened slightly, break the connected batter between each ball with skewers. Then turn each piece 90 degrees, stuffing in the edges as you are turning. The batter will flow out from the inside of each takoyaki ball and creates the other side of the takoyaki ball. After you finish flipping, set the timer for 4 minutes. Keep turning constantly so each piece will have a nice round shape. Home takoyaki grill doesn’t equally distribute heat so it’s a good idea to swap takoyaki balls around to get even brown color.
To Serve
Transfer takoyaki balls onto a plate and pour takoyaki sauce, mayonnaise. Finish off with sprinkling katsuobushi and dried green seaweed. Serve immediately (but be careful – inside is VERY hot!).

Lightly dust your hand with flour to keep the dough from sticking too much. Use your hand to knead the dough, pressing it down and reshaping it. Form it into a ball.
Sprinkle the working surface with flour. Transfer the dough onto the surface and start kneading. This is how I knead. First, press the top half of the dough, pushing forward slightly. Then pull it back and fold it in half and press it forward again with the heel of your hand twice. Then turn the dough slightly and repeat this process for 10-15 minutes or until the dough becomes smooth and silky. Sprinkle the dough with a little bit of flour at a time to help decrease the stickiness.
Form the dough into a smooth, round shape, gently tucking loose ends underneath. Coat the bottom of the bowl with oil and place the dough in the bowl. Cover it with plastic wrap and put it in a warm place until the dough doubles in size, about 30-60 minutes.
While you’re waiting for the dough to rise, make the filling. First, soak the dried shiitake mushrooms in ½ cup water. Place something heavy on top so the whole shiitake will be submerged. Set aside for 10-15 minutes.
Thinly slice the scallion. Remove the tough core of the cabbage and chop into 1” (2.5 cm) pieces.
Sprinkle the chopped cabbage with 1 tsp salt to draw out excess water.
Once shiitake mushrooms are hydrated, squeeze the liquid out, cut off the tough stem, and mince the mushroom tops.
In a large bowl, combine ground pork, scallion, and shiitake mushrooms. Squeeze the excess water out from the cabbage with your hands and add it into the bowl.
Grate ginger and add all the seasonings (1 tsp sugar, 1 Tbsp sake, 1 Tbsp soy sauce, 1 Tbsp sesame oil, 1 Tbsp potato/corn starch, and freshly ground black pepper).
Knead the mixture well until it is well combined and looks pale and sticky. Set aside (or cover with plastic wrap and keep in the fridge) until the dough is ready.
Once the dough has doubled in size, dust the working surface with flour and divide the dough in half and then roll each piece of dough into a log. Cut each log into 5 even pieces and then cut each piece in half. You can divide into fewer pieces of dough to make bigger buns. It's also easier to work with smaller dough to make nice pleats when you wrap because it's hard to hold a big dough and filling in one hand. Form each piece of dough into a ball and dust the dough balls with flour to avoid sticking to each other. Space each ball apart and cover loosely with a damp kitchen cloth to avoid drying out. Let them rest for 10 minutes.
Take a ball of dough and flatten it with your palm. Then roll it with a rolling pin into a round sheet. Here’s how I roll the dough. Hold the top of the dough with the left hand and use a rolling pin to roll out the dough with the right hand. You only need to roll up and down on the bottom half of the dough. After rolling 1-2 times, rotate the dough about 30 degrees with the left hand. Repeat this process until the dough becomes thin. The center of dough should be thicker than the edge.
Scoop 1 ½ Tbsp of filling (I use this 1 ½ Tbsp cookie scoop) and place in the center of the dough.
Hold the dough with the left hand and seal the bun using the right index finger and thumb. First, pick up a corner of the dough with your right index finger and thumb and pinch together (left picture). Without moving your thumb, use your right index finger to pick up the dough and pinch it with your thumb while rotating the dough clockwise with your left hand (right picture).
Repeat this process about 10-12 times (= 10-12 pleats) until you seal the last part of the dough by pinching it tightly. Here are some tips: your left thumb should hold down the filling and use your left fingers to turn around the wrapper. Use your left index finger to help to pleat. Also, lift up the pinched pleats slightly while you make the new pleat so the filling stays inside the dough.
Once you finish sealing the last part of the dough, twist the pleats further with your right index finger and thumb to maintain a tight seal. If you’re left-handed, reverse the directions.
Easy Alternative Option: Wrap the filling by bringing the dough up around the meat to the top, forming little pleats with the excess dough, then slightly twisting the dough to close it and pinching it firmly to join the edges.
Place the bun on a piece of parchment paper that fits the bun (for small size, 3” x 3”). Cover the finished buns with plastic wrap and repeat this process with the rest of the dough. Let the buns rest for 20 minutes.
Bring water to boil and set a steamer. Once the water is boiling, place the buns and parchment paper in the steamer tray leaving about 2” between each bun (buns will get larger while being steamed). Close the lid and steam over high heat for 10 minutes (10 for small buns, 13 for medium, 15 for big). If you use a regular pot for steaming, wrap the lid with a kitchen cloth to prevent the condensation (formed on the lid) from dripping onto the buns. Enjoy immediately.

Set a large deep pot (I use a 3.5 Quart Dutch oven) on the stovetop over medium heat. Add 3 Tbsp coconut oil and 3 popcorn kernels.
Close the lid and wait until the kernels pop. When the kernels pop, it’s when the oil is hot enough to add the rest of the popcorn kernels.
Open the lid and add 1 tsp truffle and salt and the remaining popcorn kernels.
Cover the pot with the lid and gently shake the pot from side to side (or back and forth). This will distribute the popcorns in an even layer and mix the truffle and salt with the kernels.
While the kernels pop, shake the pot occasionally over the burner to prevent the kernels from burning. When you are not shaking the pot, keep the lid slightly ajar to release the steam from the popcorn. Cook until there are about 2-3 seconds between pops. By this time, you can’t hear many kernels moving against the bottom of the pan.
Remove from the heat. Shake a few times to let the last few kernels pop and take the lid off to let the steam out, this will allow the popcorns to stay crisp. Enjoy!

In a large bowl, combine 1 large egg and ⅓ cup black sugar, and whisk together until sugar has dissolved.
Add 1 tsp oil and whisk together.
Sift 1 cup cake flour, 1 tsp baking powder, and ⅛ tsp kosher salt over the egg and sugar mixture.
Using a silicone spatula, start to combine the dry and wet ingredients. If the dough is too wet, you can add extra flour. Moisture in the air effects, so you have to decide how your dough is like. If you feel that it’s too soft and wet, add more flour 1 Tbsp at a time. The consistency is similar to cookie dough, but slightly softer. Let the dough rest for an hour.
Bring the oil in the deep fryer to 300-320ºF (150-160ºC) over medium-low heat. In order to cook inside the dough, we deep fry at low temperature. For a medium saucepan, you will need about 3 cups of oil. You can use less oil, but you will need to rotate the balls often as they won’t be covered by oil.
Prepare some oil (for rolling the dough) in a small bowl and rub it on your palms which will prevent the dough from sticking to your hands.
When the oil in the deep fryer reaches 300-320ºF (150-160ºC), scoop the dough with a cookie scooper and roll into a ball. To achieve the same portion size for whatever you're making, a cookie scooper is a great tool to have. The size should be slightly bigger than 1 inch (should be around 3 cm). We say the size should be Ping-Pong ball size (if that helps).
As soon as you are done with rolling, start putting the dough balls into the oil. They will expand so do not put too many.
Once the dough balls are cooked through, they start to float. They rotate themselves, but you can help them rotate to achieve even coloring.
When golden brown, about 7-8 minutes of deep frying, pick them up and drain excess oil on a paper towel or wire rack. Let cool for 5 minutes and enjoy!

For the sauce, grind 2 Tbsp toasted sesame seeds in your mortar and pestle. Transfer the ground sesame seeds into a small bowl. Then grate the ½” ginger and 1-2 garlic cloves (I used a Microplane grater).
In a small bowl, whisk together 3 Tbsp sugar, 3 Tbsp soy sauce, 2 Tbsp rice vinegar, 2 tsp sesame oil, and 1 tsp la-yu and set aside.
Chop the scallions into 3 pieces. Slice 1” ginger into thin slices.
Butterfly the chicken breast. Butterflying is a really useful technique to create a uniform thickness throughout a piece of meat so that it will cook more quickly and evenly. First, remove the tender (small inner fillet) by cutting away any connective tissue. Turn the breast over and with the edge of a knife parallel to the cutting board, cut the length of the side of the breast. Carefully slice the breast in half widthwise almost to the other edge. Keep the edge intact and open the breast along the fold.
In a large pot, add water, 1 tsp salt, and 2 Tbsp sake that is enough to cover the chicken. Put sliced ginger and scallions and bring it to a boil. Once boiling, put the chicken (breast and tender) in the pot, reduce the heat to the lowest setting, and cover the lid. Cook the chicken for 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, juliene carrot and cucumber. I use a juliene slicer but if you don’t have one, cut into thin sheets first and then cut into matchstick size strips.
Take out the chicken from the pot onto a plate and immediately cover with the plastic wrap to prevent from drying. Once the chicken has cooled, shred the chicken into small pices with your hands.
Rinse the butter lettuce, mint, and cilantro under water and dry completely. Set all the ingredients on the working surface.
Pour hot water in a large bowl. Working with 1 wrapper at a time, soak the wrapper in the hot water and rotate 2-3 times, about 10 seconds. The wrapper will still feel slightly stiff but don’t worry, it will become softer. Place it flat on a working surface.
Lay the butter lettuce, chicken, carrot, and cucumber at the bottom ⅓ of the wrapper closest to you, and place the mint and cilantro leaves at the top ⅓ of the wrapper.
Pressing firmly down to hold the filling in place, fold the bottom of the wrapper and start rolling tightly.
Around the middle of the wrapper, fold both sides of the wrapper in and roll up tightly to the top. Place on a plate and cover loosely with plastic wrap and repeat with the remaining wrappers and fillings. Cut in half or in thirds, and serve with the Sesame Dipping Sauce.

You can use homemade gyoza or store-bought gyoza for this recipe.
Combine 100 ml water and 2 tsp all-purpose flour.
Heat 1 Tbsp neutral flavor oil in a frying pan over medium to medium-high heat.
Cook the gyoza until the bottom is golden brown (more toward light golden brown).
Remove the hot frying pan from the heat and press on a damp cold towel for 3-5 seconds to cool the pan immediately.
Put the frying pan back to the heat. Whisk the flour mixture well one more time and pour the flour mixture into the pan. Cover the pan with a lid and cook on medium-low heat for 6-7 minutes.
If you have a glass lid, you can see the cooking process. If you don’t have a glass lid, check the amount of the liquid once in a while.
When gyoza is cooked through (skin is more see-through) and the flour mixture is almost evaporated, open the lid.
Since the gyoza is cooked already, all you need to do is to let the water evaporated. When the edges of the wings start to peel off from the pan (see right picture below), drizzle sesame oil around the edge of the wings. Adjust the heat according to the color of the wings. If it’s lighter, you can increase the heat slightly.
The sesame oil not only gives a delicious flavor, but also helps cook the flour mixture to make it crispy. Shake the pan a few times to detach the wings from the pan. You can use chopsticks to gently poke around the edges.
Put a plate over the gyoza and flip over. Tip: If you use a plate that’s smaller than a frying pan, you can gently press the gyoza so it doesn’t move around. It’s much easier to flip than using a larger plate. Be very careful as the oil might drip from the pan while you flip.
Serve the gyoza with wings with soy sauce. Optionally, you can add a tiny bit of rice vinegar or/and la-yu (Japanese chili oil).",en-US,4.34,,Just One Cookbook,15,1 serving(s),,,,,,,,,,,,

Miso Dengaku Sauce
Combine 2 Tbsp sake, 2 Tbsp mirin, 2 Tbsp sugar, and 4 Tbsp miso in a saucepan. Mix well to combine and then bring to a gentle simmer over the lowest heat. Stir constantly and cook for 2-3 minutes. Make sure the miso doesn’t burn. When the miso has thickened, it’s ready to use. To Sore: You can put the miso in the airtight container and store the refrigerator for up to 3-4 weeks.
Use the miso glaze to slather on the foods you prepare below.
★ Tofu & Eggplant Dengaku
Preheat the oven to 400ºF (200ºC). For a convection oven, reduce cooking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC). Wrap the tofu with 2 sheets of paper towel and press the tofu between two plates for 30 minutes. Alternatively, you can microwave paper towel-wrapped tofu for 60-90 seconds to dehydrate. Once the tofu is dehydrated, cut it into small bite-size (any shape is ok), and the thickness should be about ¾ inch (1.5 cm).
Cut the eggplant in half lengthwise and score it in a crisscross pattern. This will help the eggplant absorb more flavors. Immediately soak in water to prevent the eggplants from changing colors, and to remove the bitter taste. Drain and dry with a paper towel.
Place the tofu and eggplants (skin side down) on a rimmed baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a silicone baking sheet. With a brush, apply vegetable oil on top and bottom of tofu and eggplants. Bake at 400ºF (200ºC) for 30 minutes, or until the eggplant is tender. Remove the baking sheet from the oven. Adjust the oven rack 6-inches from the heating element and preheat the broiler for 3 minutes. Meanwhile, carefully spoon some of the Miso Dengaku Sauce onto your tofu and eggplants and spread evenly. Broil for 3-4 minutes, or until the top has nice char and caramelization. Transfer to a serving platter, sprinkle with sesame seeds, and serve immediately.
★ Daikon Dengaku
Peel the daikon and cut it into ¾ inch (1.5-2 cm) rounds (you can cut into half-moon shape if daikon is too big). Make a crisscross incision in the center (just one side – this will be the bottom side when serving), which helps absorb the seasonings. We call this technique “Kakushi Bocho”.
Place the daikon in the pan and cover with water. Ideally, instead of water, you want to use the rice-soaked water (the first white water that you throw away while washing rice). It’ll help daikon keep the pretty white color. Now bring to boil over high heat. Once boiling, cook on low heat for 20 minutes.
Drain the rice soaked water and put the daikon back in the pot. Cover the daikon with water, put the kombu, and bring to a boil. Right before boiling, remove and discard the kombu. Lower the heat to simmer and cook daikon for another 20 minutes, or until a skewer pierces through smoothly. Turn off the heat and transfer to a serving dish. Pour a generous amount of Dengaku Miso and sprinkle sesame seeds on top. Serve warm.
★ Konnyaku Dengaku
Cut the konnyaku into bite-size pieces and gently score each piece with a crisscross pattern on the top.
Bring water in a medium saucepan to boil and cook konnyaku for 3 minutes. Drain and allow to cool a little bit before stringing onto bamboo skewers. Slather a generous amount of Dengaku Miso on top and serve immediately.

To Prepare Ingredients
Pull off the head if it is still attached. Pull off the outer shell. Devein the back of shrimp with a skewer. The vein runs right along the back. Insert the tip of skewer sideways about ½ inch down from the head of the shrimp and pull the skewer tip up towards you. This will lift up the vein and you can pull off the vein with the skewer or with your hand. If the vein is broken, then insert again a bit lower towards the tail. If you can’t find the vein, then don’t worry about it. [Recommended] Clean the shrimp with a pinch of salt, 1 Tbsp potato/corn starch, and 2 Tbsp water in a bowl and rub until you see dirty water. Rinse until clean.
Cut the tip of the tail diagonally (as you see below).
Remove dirty water in the tail by holding the tip of the knife down on the tail and moving it from left to right squeezing the water out from the cut tip. If you skip this process, water retained in the tail might create splatter in the oil.
Now all the tail is almost translucent.
Make a couple of slits diagonally underside of the shrimp.
Hold the shrimp with both hands and straighten it as much as possible in order to get the desired shape.
In a small bowl, put the shrimp, sake, and salt and mix well together. Let it marinate until you’re ready to use them.
Peel the ginger skin and cut it into julienned strips.
Cut the negi diagonally into thin slices.
Cut the egg roll wrappers in half and peel off one egg roll at a time to separate them (now you have 10 wrappers!).
Prepare the flour mixture by mixing flour and water in a small bowl. Put the Negi Miso in a small bowl.
To Wrap
Place an egg roll wrapper in front of you with one point of the long side of the wrapper towards you. Place the Negi Miso and shrimp (tail sticking out ½ of the way onto the wrapper on the long side.
Put julienned ginger and negi on the shrimp. Fold bottom edge of the wrapper over the shrimp.

In a saucepan, combine the sauce ingredients and mix it all together. Bring it to a boil and turn off the heat (keep it covered so the sauce doesn’t evaporate).
In a deep frying pot/saucepan, add the deep-frying oil and bring it to 320ºF (160ºC).
Check if the oil has reached at 320ºF (160ºC) by putting the wooden chopsticks into the oil. If you see the small bubbles coming from the chopsticks, the oil is ready.
While waiting for the oil, we prepare the eggplant. Usually, eggplant is soaked in water to prevent discoloration. For this recipe, however, we avoid soaking in water because we will need to deep fry it without coating. You must cut the eggplant right before deep-frying to avoid changing color. Discard the tops of the eggplant and cut in half lengthwise.
Make incisions on the eggplant diagonally (or cut in a crisscross pattern). Do not cut through, and the intervals should be ⅛ inch (3 mm).
Cut each eggplant into 3-4 sections. Make sure to wipe off any moisture with paper towel.
Gently put a few pieces of eggplant, skin facing down, and deep fry for 2 to 2.5 minutes. If you put too many pieces of (cold) eggplant in the oil, the oil temperature will decrease too fast and it gets mushy and greasy. So do not overcrowd the pot. If you realize the oil temperature is too low, take out the eggplant and wait till the oil reaches the right temperature. Remove from the oil and drain on a wire rack, skin facing up. Deep fry the next batch, until all the eggplant pieces are deep-fried.
When the eggplants are cooled, transfer to a rimmed container or dish. Heat up the sauce until hot and then pour the hot sauce over to soak the eggplant for several hours (at least 1 hour). If you serve this dish chilled, put it in the refrigerator.
While soaking, peel the skin of daikon and grate.
Cut green onion and grate ginger.

Soak the bamboo skewers in water for 30 minutes.
Pile and roll up the shiso leaves, then cut into thin julienne slices. Cut the scallion into thin slices.

Grease the grill rack with brush. I use a roasting pan and rack as it can support the skewers very well while the excess oil drips down to the bottom of roasting pan when cooking.
Lightly coat your hands with sesame oil to prevent the meat from sticking. Scoop a handful of the chicken mixture (1 ½ scoop for my hand using an OXO cookie scoop) and form into a round patty.
Toss the meat to left and right hands to release the air pockets and gently squeeze to form the meat into a long oval patty, about 3-4 inches in length. Insert the skewer on the prepared wire rack.

Add the grated apple, garlic, and ginger into the sauce and mix all together.
Place the meat in a single layer and drizzle some of the sauce on top. The sauce does not have to cover the entire meat. In Japanese BBQ restaurants, they usually just drizzle a small amount to the meat.
Peel the carrot. Use a julienne peeler or a knife to cut the carrot into julienned strips.
Cut the cucumber diagonally into thin slices and then cut them into thin strips.
Cut off the green part of the green onions and we will only use the white part. Cut the white part in half lengthwise and thinly slice into long strips. Soak in iced water to make them crisp and curl.

Add ⅛ tsp kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper.
Rub the chicken wings well with your hands until they’re completely coated in the mix.
Heat the Dutch oven (I use this 4.5 Le Creuset) over medium heat. Once it’s hot, add 1 Tbsp sesame oil and distribute evenly. Add the chicken wings in a single layer, trying not to overwrap. If you cook more than 2 lbs chicken wings, you will definitely need to cook in batches.
Some parts of chicken wings may get overlapped, but that’s okay. Cover and cook on medium heat for 4-5 minutes.
After 4-5 minutes have passed, open the lid and flip the chicken wings. Now, if you are using a pot that is NOT oven-safe, then you want to brown the chicken wings nicely at this stage. Don’t turn the wings often and let the wings get nice brown char. You may need to increase the heat slightly, depending on the pot you’re using.
Cover again and cook for another 4-5 minutes. Then uncover and check if the wings need to brown more.
Add 2 Tbsp honey, 2 Tbsp brown sugar, ¼ cup sake, ¼ cup mirin, and ¼ cup soy sauce.
Lastly add all the ginger juice (roughly 1 tsp) and make sure all the wings are coated in the sauce very well.
Lower the heat and simmer for 15 minutes, until the sauce is reduced and most of the chicken wings are exposed from the sauce. When you’re about to finish simmering, preheat the broiler for 5 minutes.
Place the Dutch oven in the oven and broil for 3-4 minutes. Stay in front of the oven to make sure you don’t burn the chicken wings. My rack is in the middle and heat element is not too close to the chicken wings. Broiling time varies depending on how far your wings are from the heat element.

Soak the kombu in 5 cups (1.2 L) of water for 30 minutes. Reserve this kombu water (aka Kombu Dashi), yielding roughly 4 cups, as we will be using it for cooking later.
Soak kanpyo in water for 15 minutes and drain. Quickly rinse kanpyo under running water and rub it with 1 tsp kosher salt. Rinse again and drain well.
In a flat container, add 2 cups (480 ml) of water and 1 tsp kosher salt. Place the salmon fillets and set aside for 30 minutes to de-salt the salmon.
Remove the salmon from the salted water and gently pat dry with a paper towel.
Using a sharp knife, remove bones off the salmon (if there is any on your fillet).
If you have kitchen tweezers, they help remove the bones from the flesh very easily. Finally, remove the skin.
Cut the salmon fillets into a roughly 3.5” x ¾” log shape (or any shape that is easy to roll up in the kombu). The width of the salmon should match the width of the kombu.
Wipe off the excess moisture on the kombu with a paper towel.
Wrap the log-shaped salmon with kombu. Pull up the other end of kombu a few times as you roll tightly.
Once all the kombu is rolled up, tie each one with kanpyo. Depends on the width of the kombu, you might need to make 1 to 3 ties. Think about the final serving size and decide on the location of the knots. Here each kombu makes 2 salmon kombu roll pieces as I would be cutting each roll in half. Therefore, I’d need 2 ties/knots.
Place the kombu roll in a large pot (I use Le Creuset 3.5 QT). Add the reserved kombu dashi until kombu is fully submerged, roughly 3 cups. You don’t have to use all of the kombu dashi, but save it just in case you need to add more liquid later.
Add sake and rice vinegar.
Place the Otoshibuta (drop lid - see how we can make it with aluminum foil) on the salmon kombu roll. We do not use a regular lid throughout the cooking process. Once boiling, skim off the foam and scum on the surface. Then cook on a gentle simmer for 1 hour. If the cooking liquid evaporates too fast, add the reserved Kombu Dashi (I did not need to).
Insert a wooden skewer to check if the kombu has become tender.
Once it’s tender, add sugar and half of the soy sauce (1 ½ Tbsp).
Instead of using utensils (that can potentially break down the kombu), hold the pot and swirl it around to mix the seasonings and coat with the food. Cook covered (with otoshibuta) on simmer for 15 minutes.
Add mirin and the rest of soy sauce (1 ½ Tbsp) and cook covered with the otoshibuta on simmer for another 10 minutes, or until the cooking liquid is almost gone. Once it’s done cooking, remove from the heat and let cool.
Once cool enough to handle, cut the kombu in half (if you have 2 ties). If you like, cut off both ends for a better presentation.

Stack two slices of ham and season with freshly ground black pepper.
This is an optional step. To increase the fluffy and crispy texture of panko, spray some water on panko and fluff it up with hands.
Dip the ham into the flour, then shake off the excess. Next, run the ham through the egg to coat it on both sides.
Finally, lay the ham in the panko, turn it over and gently press it into the breading to coat. When you deep fry, panko will become fluffy again so don’t worry about pressing it.
Add the oil in a heavy-bottom pot and heat the oil to 340ºF (170ºC). You will at least need 1 inch of oil. You can check the temperature by inserting wooden chopsticks. When small bubbles appear around the chopsticks, the oil is ready. Or throw a piece of panko into the oil. If the panko immediately comes right back to the surface, oil is ready. Read more on How To Deep Fry Food.
Gently drop the panko-coated ham in the oil and deep fry for 1 minute on the bottom side. Try to maintain the oil temperature by adjusting the heat. If you’re new to deep frying, a deep-fry thermometer is helpful.
Once the bottom side is a nice golden brown, flip and cook for about 45 seconds on the other side. Drain the excess oil and remove from the pot.
Transfer to the wire rack or plate lined with a paper towel. Before you start the next batch, always pick up the crumbs in the oil (they will darken the oil)
Once they are cool enough to handle, cut them in half, and serve immediately.

Knead the mixture with hands until it gets sticky.
Squeeze water out of the napa cabbage with hands.
Add the napa cabbage in the large bowl. Mix all together with hands again.
To Wrap Gyoza and Store
Wrap the filling with gyoza wrappers (See How To Wrap Gyoza). If you don’t cook the gyoza right away, I recommend freezing because moisture from the filling may break the wrapping. To freeze, place the gyoza on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, keeping some distance to each other, and flash-freeze until hard (so now gyoza won't stick to each other). Then transfer to a freezer bag to store.
To Cook Gyoza
In a large non-stick frying pan, heat oil on medium high heat. When the pan is hot, arrange gyoza in a circular shape. If you place gyoza tightly together, the individual pieces won’t fall off when you flip them onto a serving plate.
When gyoza is browned, pour water and immediately put the lid on. Turn the heat to high and steam gyoza till most of water evaporates. Be careful not to overcook gyoza because it will burn easily.
When most of the water is evaporated, remove the lid to let any remaining water evaporate. Add sesame oil around the edge of the inner pan and cook uncovered until gyoza gets nice and crisp on the bottom.
Place a serving plate on top of the pan and quickly flip. Serve immediately.

Set the oven broiler to high (550ºF/288 ºC) for 3 minutes before cooking. Place the baking sheet in the middle rack of the oven, about 8"" (20 cm) away from the heating element. Cook for 9-10 minutes, until nicely brown and crispy, and then flip the chicken to cook the other side (skin side) for another 9-10 minutes. Watch the chicken carefully not to burn; if your oven is small/strong, try broiling at medium (500ºF/260ºC) or lower the rack.

You can add any seasonal ingredients.
In a small bowl, put 2 dried shiitake and 3 Tbsp water and rehydrate for 15 minutes. When shiitake becomes soft, squeeze water out and slice them thinly. Tip: This liquid is Shiitake Dashi. If you want to use this Shiitake Dashi as a part of your dashi in this recipe, remove 2 Tbsp from ½ cup dashi, and replace with 2 Tbsp Shiitake Dashi.
Cut chicken into small cubes so that they will be cooked fast. Marinate the chicken and shrimp in sake for 15 minutes (sake will get rid of unwanted smell).
Whisk the egg in a medium bowl. Add seasonings and ½ cup dashi. Mix well.
Then strain the mixture through a sieve into another bowl.

Gather all the ingredients. Make the standard awase dashi if you haven't prepared it yet and let it cool to room temperature (you can place the pot with dashi in it over a bowl of iced water).
Cut the chicken thigh into slanted, smaller bite-sized pieces. I use “sogigiri” Japanese cutting technique to create more surface so it will cook faster.
Put chicken pieces and shrimp each in a bowl and add 1 Tbsp sake to each bowl. This is to remove any unwanted smell from the chicken and shrimp.
Cut the carrot into ¼ inch slices. The next step is optional, but you can cut out the carrot slice into a flower shape by using a vegetable cutter or use ""nejiri ume"" Japanese cutting technique.
Make a knot at the stem of mitsuba.
Cut and discard the bottom end of shimeji mushrooms and slice kamaboko fish cake into thin slices.
To Prepare Egg Mixture
It’s best to use a kitchen scale but if you don’t have one, use a liquid measuring cup. Crack eggs in a large bowl on a kitchen scale (or in the liquid measuring cup). My 3 eggs are 153 grams or 153 ml. You will need to multiply that number by 2.5 (Read the blog post on why we multiply by 2.5). 153 x 2.5= 382. Prepare 382 grams (or ml) dashi.
Transfer the eggs into a large bowl that can fit dashi and seasonings and whisk the eggs.
Add dashi (382 ml), 1 tsp mirin, 1 tsp usukuchi soy sauce (or regular soy sauce), and ½ tsp kosher salt. Whisk all together.
Pass the egg mixture through a strainer/sieve into a liquid measuring cup (for easy pouring later on).
To Assemble
Place the ingredients in each chawanmushi cup or ramekin. You want to show the colorful ingredients on top, so put the non-colorful ingredients like chicken on the bottom. Put more colorful or unique shape ingredients toward the top.
Evenly distribute the egg mixture into chawanmushi cups. Place the mitsuba on top.
Cover the chawanmushi cups with lids or wrap with a sheet of aluminum foil (if you are going to stack one on top of another).
To Steam in Instant Pot
Fill the instant pot with 1 cup water. Set the steamer rack in place.
Put the chawanmushi cups inside. The 5th chawanmushi cup goes on top of the 4 cups.
Close the lid and click STEAM, make sure it’s LOW pressure and set the timer for zero (0) minute.
It will take about 10 minutes to reach the optimal pressure. Then beep for 0 minute. Then it will naturally release. Set your own timer for 10 minutes natural release.
At 10 minutes alarm, open the lid and take out one chawanmushi cup and go to the next step. If the lid doesn’t open, then it means the pressure hasn’t fully released yet. Prepare a kitchen towel and turn the nozzle to release pressure. Only a little bit of steam should be left, so don’t be scared. Once the pressure has released, you can open the lid.
Open the chawanmushi cup lid (or aluminum foil) and insert a skewer to see if the egg custard is fully cooked. If the custard look set and there is no liquid coming out, it is fully cooked.
If the chawanmushi is not fully cooked yet (most likely your container is bigger than my chawanmushi cups OR you must have used a colder egg mixture or ingredients), repeat the steam process, and release the air pressure manually. Remember, the egg mixture will continue to cook through from pre- and after- pressure cooking time.

Add 5 Tbsp melted butter and ½ cup honey in your slow cooker (or Instant Pot). I used slow cooker mode in my 6 QT Instant Pot.
Then add 3 Tbsp Sriracha, 1 Tbsp Thai sweet chili sauce, and ⅛ tsp salt. These wings are buttery, sweet, and spicy, and if you want some savory kick, you can add 1 tsp of soy sauce in the sauce (it's my take, not from the original recipe). Mix all together.
Add the chicken wings and toss to coat evenly using tongs.
If you’re using a slow cooker, cook on low for 4-5 hours or on high for 2-3 hours in your slow cooker. If you’re using an Instant Pot, select “Slow Cook” and set the cooking time to 2-3 hours. Please note: I suggest cooking for 3 hours from readers' feedback in the comments below.
After 2-3 hours of slow cooking in my Instant Pot, the meat is tender and almost falling off the bones. You can serve as it is, or for crispy texture, broil the chicken for a few minutes. Using tongs, gently transfer the wings to a parchment-lined baking sheet in a single layer.
Broil on high for 5-8 minutes, flipping once. If you like, you can brush the wings with more sauce. Remove from the oven and garnish with chopped cilantro and sesame seeds, if desired.

Pound the pork on both sides with a meat pounder (or the back of the knife).
Then mold the meat back into the original shape with your hands, and then cut into 2 inch pieces.
Heat oil on the heavy skillet over medium high heat and put the fattiest part on the bottom. Cook the meat until all sides are nicely browned. To prevent from oil splatter, you can use a splatter screen.
When the meat is nicely browned, transfer it to paper towel and wipe off excess fat.
Slice the ginger and cut the green part of Tokyo Negi into 2-inch pieces. Save two slices for later.
With the white part of Tokyo Negi, make Shiraga Negi for garnish (See How To Make Shiraga Negi).
In a large pot, put the seared pork belly, green part of the Negi, half of the sliced ginger (save the half for later), and pour water to cover the meat.
Bring it to a boil and then reduce heat to simmer. Cook uncovered (so unwanted smell goes away) for 2-3 hours, turning occasionally (if you want really tender meat, cook for at least 3 hours). When the liquid is running low, keep adding water (or hot water) to cover the meat.
Meanwhile make 3 hard-boiled eggs (How To Make Perfect Hard Boiled Eggs).
After cooking for 2 hours, drain and take out the meat and wipe off excess oil with paper towel.
In another large pot (I use a cast iron pot), add the pork belly, dashi, sake, and mirin. Start cooking on medium-high heat.
Add sugar, soy sauce, the rest of ginger slices, and the red chili pepper (I remove the seeds for my kids.).
When boiling, lower the heat but keep simmering. Place Otoshibuta on top (If you don't have an Otoshibuta, make one! See How To Make Otoshibuta) and do not need to put a regular lid. We’ll be cooking for 1 hour on simmer/low heat.
After cooking for 30 minutes, add the hard-boiled eggs. Remove otoshibuta and continue simmering.
Simmer for another 30 minutes. Occasionally pour the sauce on top of the meat and rotate the meat and eggs. Make sure you have enough liquid so they won’t get burnt. When the sauce gets reduced and the meat has a nice glaze, it’s ready to serve. Serve the pork belly and eggs with Shiraga Negi on top.
If you prefer this dish to be less oily and have more flavor, wait for another day. Let cool completely and store it in the refrigerator overnight.

Make an thin incision around the eggplant and also lengthwise at 3 locations so that it’s easier to peel off the skin later (think peeling banana).
Insert a chopstick or skewer to create a hole, which helps to evaporate moisture while cooking.
Use a mesh/wire rack and grill eggplant on high heat. Do you see the steam coming off from eggplant? Grill until the skin gets completely burnt and the entire eggplant becomes wilted. Remove from the heat.
Dip your fingers in iced water and start peeling the skin off. You can peel off the skin similar to a banana since there are several incisions already made. You have to peel it off quickly before the purple skin color transfer to the nice green eggplant color.
Cut into small pieces and serve on a plate.

Cut each skin-on chicken thigh into 5 to 6 pieces, about 1 ½ inch pieces.

Add the chicken to the marinade. Coat and rub the chicken with marinade using your hands/tongs. Set aside for 30 to 60 minutes.
In a medium bowl, combine potato starch and rice flour and whisk well.
In a pot, heat the oil to 340ºF (170ºC). I use a smaller 1 ½ QT pot, so that oil is deep enough and I don't have to use much oil. Use a thermometer or wooden chopsticks to see if the oil is ready (See How to Deep Fry Foods).
When the oil is hot, drain the chicken well from the marinade and coat each piece with the flour mixture.
Deep fry for 90 seconds, or until the chicken is light golden color. Work with a few pieces at a time, so the oil temperature won’t drop quickly. I worked with 3 to 4 pieces at a time.
Transfer the chicken to a wire rack to drain excess oil. Let the chicken cook with the remaining heat while you work on the rest of the chicken.
Once the chicken is all deep-fried for the first round, use a fine-mesh sieve to pick up crumbs to keep the oil clean. If you don't do this step, the crumbs get darker, and then the oil gets darker.
Increase the heat and bring the oil to 350ºF (180ºC). Deep fry the chicken for the second time for 45 seconds or until crispy and golden brown. Transfer the chicken to a wire rack to drain excess oil.

Measure the weight of edamame pods (if you do this once, you know the rough amount next time without measuring).

Start boiling water in a pot. Using a pair of kitchen shears, cut off both ends of edamame pods. If the water starts boiling, cover and turn off the heat for now.
Place the edamame in a bowl or tray and sprinkle 1 Tbsp of (40 g) kosher salt. Rub the pods against each other with hands.
Add the rest of the kosher salt into the boiling water.
Then add the edamame pods WITHOUT removing the salt. Cook on medium heat for 3-5 minutes depending on the size of the pods. It’s easy to remember 4 minutes, but start checking the doneness after passing 3.5 minutes. Remember we do not run cold water on edamame after boiling so I recommend under-cooking slightly.
Stir occasionally to make sure all the pods are cooking evenly. If you see the foam forming on the water, remove it with a fine mesh skimmer because we do not wash the pods after cooking.
Drain water in the sink or scoop up the edamame pods to a sieve. Let cool naturally so the edamame can absorb the flavor (If you skip cutting the ends of pods, please leave it for at least 1 hour). If you like, sprinkle a little bit of salt (I used sea salt flakes). Enjoy!

Set up a steamer with water in the pot, and bring to boil (and turn off and keep the lid on). I use this Nagashikan (Egg Tofu Ramekin). You can buy on Amazon (finally they have one!) or check this site to purchase. You can also use a square/rectangular container, or individual bowl such as chawanmushi cups.
Make the Sauce
In a small saucepan, bring 2 Tbsp mirin to boil and let the alcohol evaporate. When the alcohol smell disappears (after 10-15 seconds), add 150 ml dashi.
And add 1 Tbsp usukuchi soy sauce and bring to boil. Once boiling, turn off the heat and set aside.
Make Egg Tofu
Crack the eggs and whisk well. Add 2 tsp usukuchi soy sauce, ⅛ tsp kosher salt, and 300 ml dashi.
Strain the egg mixture in the fine mesh sieve to achieve silky fine texture. I believe this step makes a huge difference with the final result.
Quickly rinse the Nagashikan under cold running water and pour the egg mixture into the Nagashikan.
Scoop small bubbles on the surface with a spoon. Place the Nagashikan (or ramekin) on the steamer* rack. After trying this recipe a few more times, I also figured out a new trick. It was a bit harder to take it out the hot stainless steel Nagashikan. If you place a piece of cotton cloth underneath and sides, you can easily pull up using the cloth later. This also prevents overheating the bottom of Nagashikan from the heat beneath. *As my bamboo steamer didn't have enough height for my egg tofu ramekin to go inside, I used a 5 1/2 QT Le Creuset Dutch oven and an 8 5/8"" round cooling rack as a steamer.
Close the lid wrapped with a large kitchen towel; otherwise, the condensation built on the lid will drop onto your Tamago Tofu and ruin it. The pot should be left with the lid slightly ajar so inside the pot will not be super hot, but hot enough. Steam on the lowest heat possible on the stove for 20 minutes, or until the skewer inserted comes out clean.
Once it’s done, take out from the steamer immediately and let cool on the counter top and chill in the refrigerator for 2 hours. If you plan to serve immediately, place the Nagashikan in the ice water to cool.
Run the knife around the Nagashikan and slide out the Tamago Tofu.
Cut into 4 to 6 pieces. Transfer to a serving plate/bowl. Pour the sauce and garnish with Mitsuba (if you have any).

Day 1
Peel the lotus root and scrape the sides lengthwise with a fork. Creating a rough surface helps the batter stick to the lotus root.
Trim both ends. If the lotus root is longer than 4"" (10 cm) in length, cut it in half. Place the lotus root in a saucepan and add just enough water to cover. Add 1 tsp rice vinegar to prevent the lotus root from changing color.
Bring the water to a boil and cook for 6 minutes. Transfer to a sieve and let it stand upright to dry until the holes are completely dry (excess moisture will dilute the fillings).
In a bowl, combine 2 tsp karashi mustard and 1 Tbsp warm water and mix well.
In a medium bowl, combine 5 Tbsp panko, 1 Tbsp mirin, 1 Tbsp sugar, and 5 Tbsp white miso and mix well.
Add in the karashi mustard and mix all together.
Pile the mustard miso mixture into a small mound on a plate. Press the lotus root into the mixture repeatedly until it fills up the holes and overflow from the top.
Wipe off the excess mustard and let it stand upright on a clean plate. Cover with plastic wrap and keep in the refrigerator overnight for the best result (or minimum 5 hours).
Day 2
Next day, remove the excess mustard miso mixture from the top and bottom and wipe off the excess moisture with paper towel.
In a large bowl, beat 1 egg and sift 1 cup flour, 1 tbsp turmeric and ¼ tsp kosher salt into the bowl.
Mix all together and gradually add ½ cup water.
Stir until blended. The batter will be sticky and thick so it coats the lotus root well.
Add 3 cups oil in a small pot and bring the oil to 350ºF (180ºC) over medium heat. The oil should cover the lotus root when deep frying. Therefore, a smaller pot works better so you can use less oil.
Insert 2 bamboo skewers into the side of the lotus root. Dredge the lotus root in the batter.
Using a spoon, make sure the lotus root is completely covered with the batter. Ideally, you want to smooth out the surface. (I know, it can be challenging, as the batter tends to fall off when you touch it. Let’s do your best.).
When the oil reaches 350ºF (180ºC) (or drop a small amount of the batter in the oil and if it floats back to the surface in a few seconds, it’s ready.), submerge the lotus root, holding the bamboo sticks. Deep fry for 5 minutes. Make sure the lotus root is NOT TOUCHING the bottom of the pot; otherwise, the batter will stick to the bottom. Deep fry until crisp and golden brown. Drain excess oil on the wire rack until it’s cool enough to handle.
Slice the Karashi Renkon into ⅓ inch (8 mm) thick rounds. Serve immediately.

Cut the Brie cheese in half if you haven’t already and place the half in the freezer for 20 minutes (Store the other half in the fridge for another use). Placing the Brie cheese in the freezer for 20 minutes makes it easier to cut. Generously grease a mini muffin pan with cooking spray.
Take out one frozen puff pastry sheet and place it on a working surface sprinkled with a bit of flour. Leave it out for 10 minutes or so (depending on the room temperature) and when the puff pastry sheet is a bit softer, unfold and continue to have it thawed.
Roll the puff pastry sheet out into a 10 x 14-inch (25 x 36-cm) rectangle.
Cut the sheet crosswise into 6 even strips.
Then cut the sheet lengthwise into 4 even strips. You should have 24 squares (each square will be about 2 ½ inches on each side).
Separate the squares and press them gently into the muffin cups.
Remove the rind only from the side edges (I keep the top and bottom). The rind is edible and barely noticeable once the Brie is baked. However, I like to remove the side edges so the corner pieces don’t have too much rind.
Cut chilled Brie cheese into 24 pieces. It’s easier to cut the creamy Brie into cubes when it’s chilled and has a firm texture.
Place in 1 piece of Brie and top with a teaspoon of cranberry sauce to each pastry-lined muffin cup.
Chop candied pecans and walnuts.
Top with a teaspoon of chopped walnuts. Chill for at least 30 minutes. The cold temperatures will firm up the pastry, which will help the butter in the dough will melt more slowly. If you are making ahead, wrap them in plastic wrap and store in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.
Preheat oven to 375ºF (190ºC). Bake the bites in the preheated oven until golden brown, 18 to 20 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown and the cheese and cranberry sauce are bubbly.
Remove from the oven, let cool in the pan for a few minutes. Transfer the bites to a serving plate and garnish with sea salt and thyme (optional). Serve warm or at room temperature.

Make Kombu Dashi
Put the kombu in 4 cups of water and let steep for 20 minutes, or as long as you can (maximum overnight).
Transfer the kombu and water to a pot. Bring it to near boiling point on medium heat. If you didn’t steep for a long time at Step 1, it’s good to slowly bring the kombu water to near boiling on low heat. Once the bubbles start to appear and it looks like almost boiling, remove the kombu and turn off the heat. If you leave the kombu in water, kombu dashi can become bitter. So it’s usually recommended to take out. Use this used kombu to make a simmered kombu or homemade furikake (rice seasoning).
Prepare Other Add-ins and Garnish
Rehydrate dried wakame seaweed in water for 5 minutes. Squeeze water out and place it in miso soup bowls.
Cut the green onions into small pieces (diagonally – optional) and set aside in a small bowl.
Set the miso soup bowls and green onion aside for now.
Add Miso
A typical Japanese miso soup bowl holds about 200 ml of liquid. Miso varies in saltiness depends on types and brands; but as a general rule, we add 1 tablespoon (20 g) of miso per one miso soup bowl (200 ml dashi). I use miso muddler (one side measures 1 Tbsp, the other side 2 Tbsp). For this recipe, I use roughly 4-5 Tbsp. Tip: When you add tofu, you may want to add an extra tablespoon (that’s why I add 5 Tbsp total) because tofu contains additional moisture which dilutes miso soup.
When you add miso, turn off the heat (we should NEVER let miso soup boil). Scoop some dashi/soup into your ladle and let the miso dissolve in the ladle first using chopsticks or a whisk. Tip: Do not directly drop miso into the soup because you may end up with undissolved chunks of miso left in the soup. It’s very important to taste to check the saltiness.
Add Tofu
Cut tofu into small cubes and add to the miso soup (Please use a cutting board if you are not used to cutting it on your palm).
Reheat until hot (but not boiling) and serve. Tip: After adding miso, never let miso soup boil (It will lose the aroma and flavor and also kill the probiotics in the miso.).",en-US,4.88,,Just One Cookbook,30,4 serving(s),,,,,,,,,,,,

Soak kombu in water overnight in a large pot.
Peel taro (satoimo) and slice into rounds. Soak in water to remove the slimy texture.
Peel daikon and slice into rounds. If it’s a large daikon, cut into quarters lengthwise.
Peel carrot and slice into rounds. If you like to decorate the soup with a carrot flower, cut out some of the round slices into a floral shape. If you do so, separate the rounds and flower shapes pieces. You will be cooking round carrot slices with taro (satoimo) and daikon, but these flower slices will be cooked separately.
Add satoimo (taro), daikon, and carrots into the pot filled with kombu water. Start cooking over medium high heat. Right before full boiling, remove the kombu and discard.
Skim off foam (from satoimo/taro) from the surface of the soup with a fine mesh strainer. Lower the heat to medium low and cover with a lid, leaving a gap. Simmer until the vegetables are tender. Add water if too much liquid has evaporated.

Clean the kombu with a damp towel and soak the kombu in water for 30 minutes or overnight (preferred). NEVER wash kombu and do not remove the white substance -that’s umami! These days it's pretty clean, so you can skip this process. Just make sure there are no dirty particles.
After 30 minutes (or overnight), the kombu is rehydrated. This liquid is called cold brew Kombu Dashi.
Pour kombu dashi and kombu into a saucepan. SLOWLY bring to boil on medium-low heat so you can extract umami from kombu as much as possible. Right before the stock is boiling (it gets slimy and yields a bitter taste if you leave it), remove the kombu. Now what you have is Kombu Dashi. If you’re vegetarian/vegan, use this kombu dashi for your miso soup. What to do with used kombu? You can reuse it to make Simmered Kombu or Homemade Furikake Rice Seasoning.
If you're not vegetarian/vegan, add Katsuobushi and let it simmer for 30-60 seconds. Turn off the heat and let steep for 10 minutes.
Strain over a fine-mesh sieve and now you have roughly 4 cups of Awase Dashi. You can store in the refrigerator for up to 3-5 days and in the freezer for up to 2 weeks. Repurpose the used katsuobushi to make Homemade Furikake Rice Seasoning.
STEP 1 - Add Dashi
Here I demonstrate to make 2 cups/2 servings of miso soup. You can use the formula; 1 cup (200-240 ml) dashi + 1 Tbsp (18 g) miso = 1 serving miso soup. If you add more ingredients/vegetables, the amount of soup will increase and you will also need more miso. Add 2 cups (480 ml) dashi in the saucepan.
Are you in a hurry and no time to make dashi? You can use Dashi Packet or Dashi Powder to make instant dashi.
STEP 2 - Add dense ingredients BEFORE bringing dashi to a boil
If your miso soup doesn't include hard ingredients or clams, go to the next step. Add hard ingredients like root vegetables. Once boiling, lower the heat and simmer until they become tender. If you're making Clam Miso Soup, add clams in cold brew kombu dashi. Bring it to a gentle boil and once the shells are open, turn off the heat (do not overcook).
STEP 3- Add quick-cooking ingredients AFTER dashi is boiling
If your miso soup doesn’t include these ingredients, bring dashi to a boil and go to next step. AFTER dashi starts boiling, add in soft vegetables like leafy greens, mushrooms, deep-fried tofu pouch because they require less cooking time. At this point, keep the soup at a simmer and make sure it stays warm (not OVERBOILING).
STEP 4 - Add miso
Add a small amount of miso at a time (you can start with 2 Tbsp miso for 2 cups dashi). Put miso inside a ladle and slowly add dashi into the ladle to dissolve miso completely. You can buy a miso muddler or a fine-mesh miso strainer which helps you dissolve miso faster. If you accidentally added too much miso, dilute the miso soup with dashi (or water). NEVER OVERBOIL miso soup because it loses nutrients, flavors, and fragrance.
STEP 5 - Add tofu
Add tofu AFTER miso is completely dissolved because you might break the tofu when mixing in miso. If you add chilled tofu from the refrigerator, miso soup would get cooler. Reheat miso soup until it is just hot, but NOT BOIL.
STEP 6 - Add wakame & green onions
Add rehydrated wakame (seaweed). I recommend re-hydrating dried wakame in a separate bowl of water to get rid of saltiness, instead of re-hydrating inside miso soup. Add ingredients that do not require cooking such as chopped green onions, mitsuba, yuzu, and blanched spinach right before serving to keep the fresh fragrance and color.
To Serve:
Serve immediately. Place on the right side of the table setting (Read on Ichiju Sansai, or 1 soup 3 dishes; see the picture).
To Store:
In general, it's best to use up all the miso soup because the fragrance and taste will be lost as time passes by. Let your miso soup cool at room temperature (up to 4 hours - otherwise miso soup will be spoiled) and then refrigerate. You can keep for up to 2 days in the refrigerator. If you want to make a big batch, it's best to keep the soup BEFORE adding miso. Add the miso only for the portion you need. You can freeze miso soup for up to 2 weeks. If the miso soup contains potatoes or tofu, remove them before freezing as the textures subject to change.
To Reheat Miso Soup:
Bring miso soup in a pot over medium heat, but not to overboil. Miso loses its nutrients at high temperature.",en-US,4.71,,Just One Cookbook,55,4 serving(s),,,,,,,,,,,,

To make dashi: In a measuring cup (or a large pot), add 4 cups water and kombu and let it steep. You can do this process overnight or as soon as you start preparing. This is kombu dashi. If you're using dashi powder or dashi packet, follow this tutorial, and use it at Step 12.
Cut the pork belly into 1 inch (2.5 cm) pieces.
Cut the leek in half lengthwise, and then cut the halves into 1-inch pieces widthwise. Rinse under cold water to make sure there is no dirt inside the pieces.
Cut the cabbage leaves into small pieces.
Remove the stem of shiitake mushrooms and slice thinly.
Cut the carrot in half lengthwise, and slice thinly. Cut the green onions thinly.
Transfer the kombu dashi into a pot (if you didn’t use a pot at Step 2). Slowly bring the kombu dashi to a boil over medium low heat. When the water is almost boiling, remove the kombu to avoid sliminess. If you are vegan/vegetarian, skip next two steps (Step 9 and Step 10).
Add 3 cups katsuobushi and cook for 15 seconds. Then turn off the heat and let the katsuobushi steep in the pot for 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, in a separate large pot (or donabe), heat 1 Tbsp sesame oil over medium heat. Once the pot is hot, add the pork belly and stir to cook.
Once the pork belly is 80% cooked through, add 1 Tbsp sake and stir to combine. Then add chopped leeks.
Once leeks are wilted, add the rest of the vegetables and mushrooms. Stir to coat with the oil. Then using a fine-mesh strainer, strain the dashi into the pot.
Bring the soup mixture to a boil, skimming the foam and scum on the surface while cooking. Turn off the heat and add 2 Tbsp miso first, and then gradually add in more as you taste the soup. Each miso brand and type of miso tastes differently and the sodium level varies, so you want to taste before adding more miso.
Add the tofu into the soup and turn on the heat to continue to simmer until tofu is nice and warm (tofu is edible chilled, so you don’t have to worry about “cooking” it). Just make sure not to let the miso soup boil. It should take not more than 3-4 minutes to warm the tofu, and the soup is now ready.
Before serving, scoop out a small portion of Yuzu Kosho from the jar and place it on a small plate. Grind 2 Tbsp sesame seeds and put in in a small bowl. Serve them alongside with the donabe or soup pot. After you ladle the soup into individual serving bowls, add a pinch of Yuzu Kosho, sprinkle sesame seeds, stir in and enjoy!

To Prepare the Ingredients
Soak dried shiitake mushrooms in water to rehydrate for 15 minutes. You need just enough water to cover the mushrooms and place a smaller bowl on top to keep the mushrooms submerged in water.
Squeeze the excess water out of rehydrated shiitake mushrooms. Cut off the stems if there are any and score a cross on top like this and set aside (use it later for topping). Reserve the leftover soaking liquid (shiitake dashi) for udon soup by straining it through a mesh strainer to remove any grit or impurities before using it.
In lightly salted boiling water, blanch the spinach starting from the stem side for 1 minute.
Soak the spinach in iced water to prevent overcooking. Squeeze water out and cut into 1 ½” (4 cm) pieces.
Slice the carrot. Optionally you can cut out the carrot into a flower shape with a vegetable cutter.
Cut kamaboko into thin slices and break shimeji mushrooms into small pieces.
Slice the long green onion diagonally and cut the chicken into 1” (2.5 cm) pieces.
To Make the Udon Soup
To make udon soup, combine the dashi and shiitake dashi (reserved liquid from dried shiitake mushrooms) in a small saucepan. Bring it to a boil over medium-high heat.
Once boiling, add mirin, soy sauce, and salt. When boiling again, turn off the heat and set aside.
To Make Shrimp Tempura
To make shrimp tempura, follow this instruction to clean the shrimp and make them straight.
To make the tempura batter, combine the tempura batter mix and water. Lightly dust the shrimp with potato starch/cornstarch before dredging the shrimp in the batter. Deep fry at 340-350 ºF (170-180 ºC) until golden brown. If you want to make the tempura batter from scratch and learn tips on how to deep fry the shrimp, you can read the recipe here.
To Prepare Udon Noodles
Bring a large pot of water to boil for udon noodles. My favorite udon is the frozen Sanuki Udon. Cook the frozen udon noodles in boiling water for 30 seconds (no need to defrost). If you use dry noodles, follow the package instructions. Drain the water and chill in ice water to prevent the noodles from cooking further.
To Assemble
Divide all the ingredients (except for the egg, spinach, and mitsuba) into two individual earthen donabe clay pots (or use any big pot).
Add udon soup and cover with the lid. Bring the soup to a boil over medium-high heat. When it comes to a boil, leave the lid slightly open to let some steam out, or it will overflow. Lower the heat and simmer to cook until the chicken is cooked through.
Add an egg, spinach, and mitsuba and cover to cook until the egg is done to your liking.
Add shrimp tempura on top and serve. Sprinkle shichimi togarashi (Japanese seven spice) if you like the soup spicy.",en-US,4.84,,Just One Cookbook,60,2 serving(s),,,,,,,,,,,,

Make Dashi:
This is an extra step and not everyone follows this method, but I highly recommend removing the head and guts from the anchovies to reduce the bitter flavor in dashi (watch how I do it in this video).
Gently clean the kombu with a damp cloth (but don't wipe off the white powder - that's umami!). In a small saucepan, put 4 cups water, kombu, and anchovies.
Bring it to boil on low heat. It’s best to slowly infuse water with kombu and anchovies. Once boiling, cover and keep on low heat and simmer for 10 minutes.
Once you are done simmering dashi, strain through a fine sieve. With leftovers, you can make candied anchovies and simmered kombu, and set aside the dashi.
Prepare Ingredients:
Meanwhile, start prepping ingredients. Thinly slice the onion. Cut tofu into small blocks.
Cut napa cabbage into 2” (5 cm) pieces widthwise (cut from bottom to leafy side). The bottom part of napa cabbage is thicker so cut these pieces into smaller pieces lengthwise (See how I do it in the video).
Slice the Tokyo Negi (or green onions/scallions) diagonally into ½“ (1.3 cm) pieces and slice the carrot diagonally into ¼” (0.6 mm).
Cut garlic chives into 2” (5 cm) pieces. Discard the bottom of enoki mushrooms and loosen them up.
Rinse bean sprouts and place all the vegetable ingredients on a plate. Cut the sliced pork belly into 2” (5 cm) pieces and set aside.
Make Kimchi Nabe:
In a large donabe (4-5 serving) or pot, heat 1 Tbsp. sesame oil over medium-low heat and add the sliced pork belly. Stir fry the meat until no longer pink.
Add kimchi and onion and stir fry for 5 minutes.
Then add 1 Tbsp sake and 1 Tbsp gochujang.
Add 1 tsp gochugaru and 1 Tbsp sugar and mix it all together.
Add kimchi juice and dashi and make sure it’s mixed evenly.
Cover and bring to boil. Once boiling, reduce heat to low and cook for 5 minutes.
Add 1 Tbsp soy sauce and 1 Tbsp miso. Mix all together and make sure the miso is completely dissolved.
Add the rest of ingredients and cover to cook on medium heat for 10 minutes, or until all the ingredients are tender.
Taste the soup and add kosher salt if necessary (I added about ½ tsp). Each miso has different saltiness so you really need to taste the soup to adjust the flavor.

Gather all the ingredients for Chanko Nabe Broth.
To make the broth, in a Dutch oven or other large pot over medium heat, combine the broth, sake, mirin, ginger juice, and garlic and bring to a simmer.
Spoon several spoonfuls of broth into a small bowl, add the miso, and stir until smooth.
Gradually add the miso mixture to the broth in the pot, stirring to avoid lumps. Once the miso has been incorporated, do not let the broth boil.
To make the chicken meatballs:
Gather all the ingredients. This grater (I have 6"" one) works great for grating ginger (daikon, garlic, etc) and keeping the juice from grating it. In this recipe, we only use ginger juice.
In a large bowl, combine the chicken, ½ beaten egg (reserve the remaining egg for another use), the ginger juice, soy sauce, corn starch, panko, and green onion. Using your hands, mix all together.
Once the mixture becomes a little bit white and well combined, shape the mixture into a ball. Sprinkle with panko as needed.
To cut all the ingredients:
Cut the cod fillet into 2-inch chunks, peel and devein shrimp, cut the sliced pork belly into 2-inch pieces, trim the visible fat from the chicken thighs and cut into bite-sized pieces, cut the tofu into 1-inch cubes, and separate the leaves from napa cabbage and cut them into smaller pieces. Slice the carrot and cut out with a flower-shaped vegetable cutter.
Cut negi (long green onion) diagonally into 1-inch-thick pieces, cut the green onions into 2-inch lengths, and remove stems of shiitake mushrooms and make a decorative cut on the caps if desired.
To set up the table:
To prepare the stew ingredients, place the meatballs, seafood, pork belly, chicken, tofu, carrot slices, napa cabbage, long green onion, green onions, and mushrooms on the platter.
Pour the ponzu sauce and sesame sauce (goma dare) into individual dipping bowls at each place setting along with chopsticks, a soup spoon (optional) and a soup bowl.
Place a portable gas burner and the nabe, and the stew ingredients on the table. If you don’t have a gas/electric burner, you can cook the stew on the stovetop, transfer it to a large bowl, and serve it family style.
To cook Chanko Nabe:
If cooking the stew ingredients on the stovetop, cook in batches. Add some of each of the ingredients to the broth, simmer (do not boil) until cooked, and serve them, returning to the stove to start a new batch as each previous batch is eaten. The vegetables and tofu cook more quickly than the meatballs, seafood, and chicken.
Keep the broth at a simmer the entire time. If the liquid gets low, add a little water or chicken broth to have enough liquid to heat the noodles or rice at the end (even though you are thinning the broth, the flavorful ingredients you are cooking in it continue to enrich it).
When diners are ready, remove any solids in the broth and add the noodles or rice. Simmer until heated through, then ladle into the soup bowls and serve.",en-US,4.47,,Just One Cookbook,60,6 serving(s),,,,,,,,,,,,

Make kombu dashi by soaking the kombu into 4 cups water. I used Kombu Dashi this time but I have made this hot pot with Awase Dashi (Kombu + Katsuobushi (dried bonito flakes)) and they both taste wonderful.
Cut the monkfish into larger bite-size pieces, about 1.5-2 inch pieces.
Cut the steamed monkfish liver into ½ inch rounds. If you have raw liver, you will need to steam it for 10 to 20 minutes first.
Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Once boiling, add the monkfish to blanch for 15 seconds.
Remove the fish from the pot and immediately transfer into a bowl of iced water. This will remove the fishy smell and help firm up the flesh of the fish. Once chilled, remove from the iced water and set aside.
Cut the negi diagonally (If you use leek, rinse well to get rid of the dirt between them).
Cut napa cabbage into bite-size pieces.
Cut shungiku into 2-inch pieces and tofu into cubes.
Discard the bottom part of enoki mushrooms and rinse quickly.
Discard the stem of shiitake mushrooms and add the decorative cut if you like (See How to Make Decorative Shiitake). Cut out carrot flower (See How to Make Flower Carrot).
Set a donabe (Japanese earthenware hot pot) over a portable stove at the table. You can also cook in a large pot on your stove top.
Add the monkfish liver in the donabe and cook on low heat. As soon as the liver starts releasing oil, use a wooden spatula/ spoon to smash it into a paste or ground-meat-like texture. It may burn a little bit, but that’s okay as long as it’s very mildly charred. It adds more flavors.
Once the liver gets pasty, add 5 Tbsp miso and combine well. Each miso brand/type has different saltiness and you just have to taste and decide if you need to add more (you will need at least 5 Tbsp).
Gradually add kombu dashi while mixing the miso mixture.
Add 4 Tbsp mirin, 2 Tbsp sake, and 4 Tbsp soy sauce, and mix well.
Add negi (leek/green onion), bottom part of napa cabbage, shungiku, shirataki, enoki mushrooms, and monkfish.
Let cook a little longer before you add in tofu and shiitake mushrooms.
Once boiling, add leafy parts of napa cabbage and shungiku. Cover, and continue to cook for another 7-10 minutes. Skim fat and scum using a fine mesh sieve.

Slice the ginger and thinly cut green onion/scallion. Keep the ginger on the side and put the green onion in a small serving bowl.
Cut the napa cabbage into quarters lengthwise. Without cutting the edge, wash the leaves carefully and drain well. Don’t throw away the leaves that naturally came off while rinsing. We’ll use these leaves later on.
Place each slice of pork belly between the napa cabbage leaves. If you have extra pork belly, you can put an additional slice in outer layers which have wide leaves. If the pork belly is too long for the napa cabbage, you can trim with a kitchen shear and place it in other parts of the napa cabbage.
Once the pork belly slices are nicely tucked in, cut the napa cabbage into 3-4 pieces, about 2 to 2 ½ inches (5-6 cm).
Start packing the layers of napa cabbage/pork belly from the outer edges of donabe (or hot pot or regular pot) and work your way towards the center. The napa cabbage/pork belly layers should be packed tightly as they become loose once it starts cooking.
If you don’t have enough layers, you might want to consider a smaller pot (remember the size of your napa cabbage and proportional pot size you used for next time) or place other ingredients in the center. Here I stuffed the center with napa cabbage leaves that came off while rinsing and cutting the napa cabbage. You can also put enoki mushrooms or shimeji mushrooms in the center.
Combine the soup ingredients (5 cups dashi, 2 Tbsp sake, 1 Tbsp soy sauce, slices of 1-inch ginger, and ½ tsp kosher salt). Don’t cut down on the salt as napa cabbage releases liquid when it's being cooked and will dilute the soup a little bit.
Pour the soup into the pot and start cooking on high heat. Once boiling, skim the foam and fat on the surface. Then reduce the heat to medium-low heat and cook until napa cabbage is tender and pork belly is cooked through, roughly 8-10 minutes.

Soaking the Oxtails
To completely remove blood from the bone, soak the oxtails in cold water for 1 hour and discard the water.
Prepare Vegetables
Meanwhile, cut the onions into wedges, chop celery stalks into small pieces, and cut the carrots into chunks.
Roughly cut the cabbage into 1 inch (2.5 cm) squares and rinse under running water.
Cut the tomatoes into wedges and cut them in halves. Cut Yukon gold potatoes into quarters and soak in water for 15 minutes to remove excess starch.
Cut the stew beef into smaller pieces.
Boiling the Oxtails
After soaking the oxtails in one hour, drain and place them in a large pot and cover it with cold water. Bring it to boil over medium-high heat. Once boiling, turn down the heat and simmer for 15 minutes. Using a fine-mesh sieve, skimming foam on the surface frequently. After simmering, take out the oxtail or drain the water. Blanching oxtails before cooking helps remove blood and impurities.
Sautéing the Ingredients
Press the “Saute” button on your Instant Pot (I use this 6 QT Instant Pot) and heat 1 ½ Tbsp olive oil.

To make wonton soup, cut 1 green onion into 2 inch (5 cm) pieces. Add the chicken stock and the green onion in a large pot and bring to boil.
Once boiling, season with sesame oil, kosher salt, and white pepper powder. Turn off the heat and set aside.
To make fillings, chop 2 green onions into small rounds. Save some chopped green onion to serve with the soup.
Chop cilantro and set aside to serve with the soup.
Cut the shrimp into smaller pieces, and then cut them into even smaller pieces (almost like paste).
In a large bowl, combine the pork, shrimp, and chopped green onion. Grate fresh ginger and add to the mixture.
Add all the wonton seasoning ingredients to the mixture and mix well.
While you wrap wontons, bring a large pot of water to boil. Place a wonton wrapper on your hand. Place a teaspoon of the filling in the center of the wrapper. Start with a small amount so it’s easier to work with. Use your finger to moisten the edges of the wrapper with water.
When the edges have been moistened, fold the wrapper in half to create a rectangular shape, pressing any air that might be trapped around the filling. Fold the sides inward so that they overlap.
Wet the portion where the sides meet. Pinch to close and seal.
Here is the cute little wonton! Place the finished wontons on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Cover with plastic to keep them moist as you continue with the remaining fillings and wrappers.
To Serve
To cook wontons, put 5 to 10 wontons into a boiling water in a large pot. Depending on how big your pot is, you can add more/less wontons. Do not overcrowd the pot. Cook for 5 minutes, or until wontons float on the surface of the water and are tender and translucent. I boil wontons separately from the soup so it stays clear and clean.
Transfer wontons to serving bowls. Continue with the rest of the wontons. When you are done with cooking, pour some hot soup over wontons and garnish with chopped green onions and cilantro. Sprinkle some white pepper. You can also serve with soy sauce, chili sauce, etc.
To Store
To freeze the wontons, flash freeze for 1 hour (place them on a parchment-lined baking sheet covered with plastic wrap) and transfer them to a freezer bag. Keep in the freezer for up to 1-2 months. When you're ready to cook, do not defrost and cook frozen dumplings in boiling water for 12 minutes.
Leftover filling: Make mini meatballs or patties and cook them in a frying pan. Once they are pan fried, you can pack them in an airtight container and store in the freezer for later use.
Leftover wrappers: Wrap a small piece of cheese and pan fry or deep fry cheese wontons. They are kids’ favorite!",en-US,4.58,,Just One Cookbook,40,4 serving(s),,,,,,,,,,,,

Make Dashi
Make 3 cups dashi using one of 3 Ways to Make Dashi. Here I used the convenient dashi packet method. If you’re vegetarian/vegan, use Kombu Dashi. If you want to make standard Awase Dashi.
Prepare Ingredients
Cut the end of shimeji mushrooms and separate into smaller chunks.
Cut the stem of shiitake mushrooms and cut in halves. I use “sogigiri"" cutting technique to increase the surface.
If you like, you can make a decorative cut on the shiitake mushrooms.
Cut Kamaboko fish cake into 4 slices.
Cut the Negi (long green onion) diagonally, and separate white and green parts (we will add them to the pot at different times).
Pour hot water over aburaage to get rid of the factory oil. Some people skip the step as the oil used is cleaner these days. I do it anyway to get rid of excess oil. [Optional] Cut into smaller pieces. I cut into triangles.
Cut the chicken into smaller bite-size pieces. I use ""sogigiri"" technique to create a bigger surface of the chicken so it will cook faster and absorb more flavors.
Bring a pot of water to a boil. Add the frozen udon noodles and loosen it with chopsticks. As soon as they are loosened (30 seconds or so), drain the udon noodles into a colander and set aside. If you use dry noodles, follow the package instructions.
Crack eggs into a small bowl (so you won’t accidentally drop an egg shell into the pot) and make sure all ingredients are now ready to go!
Cook Miso Nikomi Udon
In a large pot (or donabe), add 3 cups dashi, chicken, and white part of negi.
Cover to cook on medium heat for 10 minutes, or until the outside of the chicken is no longer pink (inside can be still pink at this stage). When boiling, turn the heat down to simmer. Skim off the fat and scum with a fine mesh skimmer.
Add 3 Tbsp mirin and 3 Tbsp miso (keep 1 Tbsp for later. Why? Read my post.). I use a Miso Muddler and it works wonderfully to make sure miso is dissolved completely. You should place miso in a ladle and use chopsticks to let miso dissolve inside the ladle before releasing it into the dashi. That way you can make sure there are no miso chunks left at the bottom of the pot.
Add udon noodles, aburaage, shimeji mushrooms, shiitake mushrooms, and green part of negi. If you care about the presentation of this dish, now is a good time to place each ingredient and fish out the chicken pieces and place on top of udon noodles.
Increase the heat to medium, cover with the lid, and cook for 5 minutes. When boiling, turn the heat down to simmer. Once in a while, make sure to check udon or other ingredients are not stuck on the bottom of the pot, by inserting cooking chopsticks. Skim off the fat and scum with a fine mesh skimmer.
Add 1 Tbsp miso in the soup. Be careful not to drop the chunk of miso. Use a ladle as a “mixing bowl” so you won’t lose the miso.
Add kamaboko fish cakes (where it could have a nice color) and carefully drop the eggs in the middle. From this point, you do not want to cover with the lid (egg yolk will have a thin white coating when you cover). Cook for 2-3 minutes.

Prepare Stew Ingredients
Peel and cut each potato into bigger chunks (if you want to keep their shape when serving).
Peel the carrot and cut into smaller chunks. I use ""rangiri"" Japanese cutting technique.
Cut the onion in half lengthwise, and then cut each half into 6 wedges. Finally, cut them in half widthwise.
Slice the mushrooms and cut the head of broccoli into florets.
Cut the chicken thighs into smaller pieces. I use ""sogigiri"" Japanese cutting technique to create more surface space so the chicken pieces cook faster. Season the chicken with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
To Cook Ingredients in Instant Pot
Press the “Sauté” button on your Instant Pot and heat 1 Tbsp olive oil and 1 Tbsp unsalted butter.
When the pot is hot and butter is melted, add the chicken.
Stir and coat the chicken with oil.
Add the onion, carrot, mushrooms, and potatoes.
Add the chicken broth and 1 bay leaf.
Close the lid and set HIGH pressure for 2 minutes.
Make sure the steam release handle points at “sealing” and not “venting”. The float valve goes up when pressurized.
To Cook Ingredients in the Pot over the Stove
Heat the olive oil and butter in the pot over medium heat. Add the chicken and saute for 2 minutes. Then add onion and carrot and cook until coated with oil. Add the mushrooms, potatoes, broth (3.5 cups/800 ml), and bay leaf. Bring it to boil, then reduce heat to simmer (low) to cook for 20 minutes, or until carrots and potatoes are tender.
To Blanch Broccoli
While pressure cooking, blanch broccoli. Bring water to boil in a small saucepan. Once boiling, add a pinch of salt and broccoli florets.
Cook until tender but do not overcook. Transfer the broccoli to ice water to stop cooking further. Once cool, remove, drain, and set aside.
To Make White Sauce (Bechamel Sauce)
In a saucepan, melt the butter on medium heat but don’t let it brown. Microwave 1 cup of milk until it is warm to the touch and set aside.
Once the butter is melted completely, add the flour.
Stir quickly and constantly with a whisk to combine. Cook the flour mixture for 3-4 minutes, without letting it brown.
Pour a small amount of the warm milk at a time, and stir as the sauce thickens.
Gradually add the rest of the milk by whisking continually until smooth. Cook, stirring constantly, until starting to bubble and thicken.
Lower the heat and add white pepper and salt to taste.
Cook, stirring constantly, for 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside.
Once Pressure Cooking Is Done...
When it’s finished cooking, the Instant Pot will switch automatically to the “Keep Warm” mode. Let the pressure release naturally for 15 minutes and then proceed with the quick release by turning the steam release handle to the “venting” position to let steam out until the float valve drops down. Tip: Hold a kitchen towel and do not place your hand or face over the steam release valve. There should only be a little bit of steam left after 15 minutes of natural release.
Open the lid and insert a skewer in the center of the potato to see if it’s cooked through.
Using a ladle, take out 1 cup of soup from the stew.
Put the white sauce back on the stove and heat on low heat. Add several tablespoons of the soup and whisk well to combine.
Gradually add the rest of soup, stirring constantly, to combine.
Put the white sauce back in the instant pot and gently mix the white sauce with the rest of stew.
Press the “Sauté” button on your Instant Pot and press “Adjust” to set “Less” heat.
The stew will thicken as it's heated. Season with freshly ground black pepper and discard the bay leaf if you can find it.
Add the blanched broccoli and heat up. Serve the steamed rice on one side of the bowl and pour the Cream Stew on the other side of the bowl.

To De-Grit and Clean Clams
De-grit clams by following my detailed How To De-Grit Clam post. Even though some packages may say “ready to use”, I highly recommend doing this process. Quick Summary: Add 1 Tbsp salt in 2 cups water in a bowl and let it dissolved completely. Tip: Place a sieve in the bowl so that any sand and grit the clams purge would stay on the bottom of the bowl instead of being consumed by the clams again.
Add the clams inside the sieve without overlapping each other. The water level should be right around the clam’s mouth. If there isn’t enough salt water, make more using the same ratio (1 Tbsp salt for 2 cups water). Cover the bowl with aluminum foil to create a dark environment for clams and leave it in a cool place for 2 hours. This should give clams enough time to purge sand and grit.
Wash the clams carefully with a brush. Clams are now ready to use.
To Prepare Clam Miso Soup
In a medium pot, put the clean clams, 2 cups water, and kombu and bring it to a boil over medium heat.
When boiling, reduce the heat to medium-low.
Skim off the scum using a fine-mesh skimmer. Tip: Prepare a cup/bowl of water and dip the skimmer in the water to clean.
When all the clams opened up, turn off the heat immediately and do not overcook it. Remove and discard the kombu.

To Make Sukiyaki Sauce
Combine 1 cup sake, 1 cup mirin, ¼ cup sugar, and 1 cup soy sauce in a small saucepan and bring it to a boil. Once boiling, turn off the heat and set aside. This Sukiyaki sauce can be stored in an air-tight container in the refrigerator for up to a month.
To Prepare the Ingredients
If your udon is frozen, cook it in boiling water until loosen. Remove from heat and soak in iced water to prevent overcooking them. Drain and transfer to a plate covered with plastic. You will not need it till the end of the sukiyaki meal.
Prepare sukiyaki ingredients. Cut napa cabbage into 2” (5 cm) wide then cut in half right at the middle of the white part.
Cut shungiku into 2” (5 cm) wide, and slice Tokyo negi. Discard the bottom part of enoki and tear into smaller bundles.
Discard the shiitake stem and decorate the top of shiitake if you like.
Cut tofu into smaller pieces (I usually cut into 6-8 pieces).
If you like, you can slice some carrots and then stamp them into a floral shape for decoration.
Drain and rinse the shirataki noodles (sorry no photo). Put all the ingredients on one big platter for the table or into smaller individual servings.
To Cook Sukiyaki
Set a portable gas cooktop at the dining table. Each person should have a medium-sized bowl where the cooked food is being transferred to from the pot. Heat a cast iron sukiyaki pot (or any pot) on medium heat. When it’s hot, add 1 Tbsp cooking oil (or beef fat).
Place 2-4 slices of well-marbled beef to sear and sprinkle 1 Tbsp brown sugar. Flip and cook the other side of the meat. You can pour a little bit of Sukiyaki Sauce over the meat and enjoy some (or all) of the sweet and nicely caramelized meat now (this is to enjoy the good quality meat), and continue to the next step.
The First Round of Sukiyaki
Pour half of the Sukiyaki Sauce you made (1 ⅓ cup) and 1 cup dashi (or water) in the pot.
Add vegetables, tofu, and other ingredients to the pot (keep the udon for later). Add more Sukiyaki Sauce or dashi (or water) if necessary. The ⅔ of the ingredients should be submerged in the broth. Put the lid on and bring to a gentle boil. Once boiling, turn down the heat and simmer until the ingredients are cooked through. Once ingredients are cooked through, you can add more beef as beef will cook fast. Enjoy the first round of sukiyaki. If the sauce gets too salty (from evaporating), add dashi (or water) to dilute. If the vegetables diluted the sauce too much, then add more sukiyaki sauce.
The Second/Third Round of Sukiyaki (Optional)
When there is less cooked food in the pot, divide the leftover into individual bowls. Then start cooking the second round by adding more ingredients to the pot (repeat the previous step). While the second round of sukiyaki is being cooked, you can enjoy the leftover from the first pot or any side dishes.
To End the Meal
We usually end the sukiyaki meal with udon. When most of the ingredients have disappeared, add udon to the pot. Cook until heated through and enjoy.
To Store

If you use miso which contains dashi in it, skip dashi powder. If your miso doesn’t contain dashi, then you will need to prepare dashi powder. The one I use in this recipe is MSG-free/additive-free. You can purchase a similar one on Amazon or Japanese grocery stores.
Boil roughly 2 cups (460 ml) water and pour over both sides of the aburaage (deep-fried tofu pouch). The hot water help remove some of the oil from the production process. Once it’s cool to touch, squeeze tightly or pat dry with a paper towel.
Cut in half lengthwise and cut into thin strips widthwise.
Cut the green onions in half and cut into thin rounds. Pat dry the chopped green onions with a paper towel to remove excess moisture.
To Assemble
Prepare 5 mason jars and caps.
If you are using miso without dashi: Scoop 1 Tbsp miso and add to each jar. Then add ½ tsp dashi powder to each jar.
If you are using miso with dashi: Scoop 1 Tbsp miso and add to each jar.
Divide and add the aburaage strips and green onion into the 5 jars.
Divide and add dried wakame seaweed into the 5 jars. Close the lid.

Gather all the ingredients. Please make dashi and oxtail broth ahead of time.
Fish cakes: Boil 4 cups (1000 ml) water. Meanwhile, open the oden mix packages and place the fish cakes in the sieve. Pour boiling water all over the fish cakes to remove the excess oil. Alternatively, you can place them in boiling water for 15 seconds. If you prefer, cut the big pieces into smaller pieces.
Konnyaku: Cut a slab of Konnyaku into 4 equal rectangles. Then cut each rectangle diagonally so now you have 8 triangle pieces.
Then scorch the flat surfaces of konnyaku with crisscross incision. This helps konnyaku to absorb more flavors during cooking.
In a small pot, place all the konnyaku in cold water and bring to a boil. Then cook for 1 minute and drain or using a tong to remove the pieces. Set aside.
Daikon radish: Peel the daikon and cut into ½ to ⅔ inch (1 cm) pieces. To prepare daikon for oden properly, please follow this recipe post where we remove corners of daikon to prevent from breaking and then pre-cook it. In this recipe, I cut daikon thinner than my stovetop method so it will cook faster.
Octopus: If you’re using frozen octopus, defrost and put each piece of octopus into skewers. If you’re using long octopus legs, you can skewer each piece (see this oden post).
To Make Oxtail Dashi Broth
In your slow cooker (or Instant Pot), add 2 ½ cup oxtail broth, 2 ½ cup dashi, 2 tbsp mirin, and 2 tbsp soy sauce.
Add ½ tsp kosher salt and 1 tsp sugar.
To Cook Oden
Add daikon, oxtail meat from the oxtail broth, boiled eggs, and konnyaku.
Then add octopus skewers, fish cakes, and mochi pouch (click here to make your own mochi pouch).
Cover and lock the lid. Make sure the steam release handle points at “sealing” and not “venting”. Press the “Slow Cook” button to switch to the slow cooking mode. Press “+ (plus)” button to change the cooking time to 5-6 hours.
When it is finished cooking, the Instant Pot will switch automatically to the “Keep Warm” mode. Open the lid and scoop some liquid over the fish cakes (you can also do this extra step while slow cooking).
To Serve
In a small bowl, combine 2 tsp Japanese hot karashi mustard with 1 tbsp hot water. Mix well and cover with plastic wrap. Turn it over and let it steam under the bowl for 5 minutes to release the fragrance. Unwrap the bowl and the mustard is ready to use.
Serve the assortment of oden ingredients on a plate with some soup. Put a small dollop of karashi hot mustard on the edge of the plate. When you eat, dab the fish cakes or other foods with a tiny bit of mustard. You can drink the soup if you like, and I like to break the egg in half and let it absorbs the soup before eating.

1) Japanese Turnip Miso Soup
Cut off the ends and peel the turnip.
Cut the turnip in half and thinly slice the halves.
To remove the oil from aburaage, you can either pour boiling water over the tofu pouch in a sieve over the sink or have a quick blanch over the boiling water in a small pot for 15 seconds (flipping 1-2 times). Once that’s done, cut the aburaage in half widthwise, and cut thinly. Keep the other half for future use.
In a small saucepan, add 1 ½ cup water, sliced turnip, and the aburaage.
Cover with the lid, but keep it slightly ajar to avoid boiling over. Bring it to a boil over medium heat. Once boiling, lower the heat to simmer and cook the turnip for 5-6 minutes, or until it’s transparent.
If you wish to add the turnip leaves into the soup, quickly chop the green leafy part of the turnip. Add some into the soup and save the remaining greens. At this stage, make sure the soup is hot and you’re about to serve miso soup. What to do with the rest of the chopped leaves? Read Notes for a quick delicious recipe.
Make sure the soup is hot as we will not reheat and turn off the heat. Add miso into the ladle, NOT into the soup. Use a pair of chopsticks (or fork) to dissolve the miso completely in the ladle before releasing it into the soup.
ALWAYS taste the miso soup before adding more miso. Serve immediately. If you need to reheat the miso soup, make sure not to let it boil, once you see steam coming off, you can turn off the heat.
2) Bamboo Shoot & Wakame Miso Soup
Soak the dried wakame seaweed in water for 5 minutes. Drain, squeeze water out and set aside.
Cut the green onions thinly and set aside.
Cut the bamboo shoot into small bite-size thin pieces.
In a small saucepan, add 1 ½ cup water and sliced bamboo shoots.
Cover with the lid, but keep it slightly ajar to avoid boiling over. Bring it to a boil over medium heat. Once boiling, turn off the heat.
Make sure the soup is hot at this stage as we will not reheat. Add miso into the ladle, NOT into the soup. Use a pair of chopsticks (or fork) to dissolve miso completely in the ladle before releasing it into the soup. ALWAYS taste the miso soup before adding more miso.
Serve immediately. If you need to reheat the miso soup, make sure not to let it boil, once you see steam coming off, you can turn off the heat.
3) Snap Pea Miso Soup
To remove the oil from aburaage, you can either pour boiling water over the tofu pouch in a sieve over the sink or have a quick blanch over the boiling water in a small pot for 15 seconds (flipping 1-2 times). Once that’s done, cut the aburaage in half widthwise, and cut thinly. Keep the other half for future use.
Pull off the tough string that runs along the length of the pod. Then cut in half diagonally.
In a small saucepan, add 1 ½ cup water and aburaage. Place the lid, keeping it slightly ajar to avoid boiling over. Bring it to a boil over medium heat, and once boiling, lower the heat to simmer.
Add the snap peas and warm them for 2 minutes on a simmer (don’t overcook). Turn off the heat.
Make sure the soup is hot at this stage as we will not reheat. Add miso into the ladle, NOT into the soup.

To Prepare the Dashi
In a large pot (I used a donabe), add dashi broth. If you are making dashi from scratch, here’s the direction (https://www.justonecookbook.com/how-to-make-dashi/). In this recipe, I show you how to make dashi using a dashi packet. Add water and a dashi packet in the donabe.
Cover the lid and slowly bring water to boil on low heat. After a few minutes, open the lid and shake the bag to release more flavors.
Close the lid and continue to heat the broth. Once boiling, cook for 3 minutes and discard the dashi packet. Keep the lid closed and set aside.
To Prepare the Ingredients
Remove the excess fat from the chicken and cut it into small bite-sized pieces.
Discard the tough stem of shiitake mushrooms and thinly slice the caps.
Cut the carrot into quarters lengthwise and thinly slice them.
Cut the green onions into thin pieces and put them in a small bowl. We use them as a garnish at the end.
If you’re using cold cooked rice, put it in a fine-mesh sieve and rinse the rice under running water to remove excess starch. Shake and drain well. If you’re using freshly made rice, you can skip this process.
To Cook Zosui
In a hot dashi broth, add the chicken.
Close the lid and bring it to boil on medium-low heat. Once boiling, skim the scum and foam on the surface.
Add the carrot and cook covered until tender, about 4-5 minutes.
Once the carrot is tender, add soy sauce and salt to the broth.
Add the shiitake mushrooms and well-drained cooked rice. Cover to cook for 10 minutes.
Beat the egg in a bowl.
Slowly drizzle a small amount of the beaten egg over the soup surface, which will create a fluffy texture.

To Prepare the Chicken
Cut the chicken into 1 ½ inch pieces at a diagonal angle. The slanted surface gives each piece a flatter and more open surface so the chicken cooks evenly and faster. This cutting technique is called Sogigiri in Japanese.
Season the chicken with salt and freshly ground black pepper
To Blanch Broccoli
Cut off the broccoli florets and remove the tough skin of the stem and cut into small pieces.
Boil a pot of water and add salt. Start cooking the stem first for 1.5 to 2 minutes.
Then add the florets and cook for 2 minutes, or until almost tender but crisp. Remove from the water and let cool. You can shock the blanched broccoli in ice water to make it as bright green as possible, but since I add them to the stew anyway, I usually skip that extra step. But don’t overcook as we will reheat them in the stew.
To Prepare Other Ingredients
Cut the onion in half lengthwise and then into wedges. Tip: Separate each layer at this step, then you don't have to do it in the pot later.
Peel and cut the carrots at an angle into 1 ½ inch pieces, after rotating 90 degrees each time. This cutting technique is called Rangiri in Japanese.
Cut the potatoes into 1 ½ inch pieces. For these Yukon gold potatoes, I did not remove the skin.
Cut the mushroom stem and slice caps.
To Cook Ingredients
In a large pot (I used a 4 ½ QT pot), heat 1 Tbsp butter and 1 Tbsp olive oil over medium heat. If you're using a non-stick pot, you can omit the olive oil.
Add the chicken and sauté until 80% cooked through.
Add the onion and stir to cook until the chicken is no longer pink.
Add the potatoes and carrots and coat well with oil in the pot.
Add the chicken broth and 2 bay leaves.
The chicken broth doesn’t have to fully cover ingredients at this time as they will be eventually submerged when vegetables release moisture. Bring it to a boil on medium heat.
Once boiling, skim off the scum and foam and reduce heat to simmer.
Add mushrooms and simmer on a gentle heat, covered, for 10 minutes (set timer!).
To Make Bechamel Sauce (White Sauce)
Meanwhile (you have 10 minutes!), we make Bechamel Sauce. In a small saucepan, heat the butter and let it melt completely on medium-low heat. During this time, heat up the milk to warm to touch in the microwave or on the stove.
Add in the flour and stir constantly, without stopping.
The butter-flour mixture will swell and bubble. Continue to cook, stirring constantly, for the next 5 minutes. You want to make sure the flour is cooked and does not have raw flour taste.
Slowly and gradually add warm milk to the saucepan, one tablespoon at a time while you combine it with the butter-flour mixture.
Don’t hurry, and NEVER add too much liquid. You do not want to create lumps and once you get them, they are hard to fix.
The goal is to blend the mixture COMPLETELY before you add more liquid.
Add salt, white pepper, and nutmeg, and mix all together. Turn off the heat and set it aside.
To Combine White Sauce and Broth
After 10 minutes of simmering, open the lid.
Check the doneness by inserting a skewer into a potato. It should be tender, but don't overcook. It should not break easily. Scoop broth with a ladle.
Slowly pour the broth into the Bechamel sauce while stirring to blend together completely.
Add another ladle of broth and combine well. Now pour the white sauce back into the pot. Gently mix so that white sauce is well blended with the broth.
Add the heavy cream (if you’re using it) and season with salt to taste.
Simmer, uncovered, for another 5-10 minutes on low heat. [Optional Step] To improve the flavor, I highly encourage you to let the stew sit at the stove or counter to let cool to room temperature (keep the lid open). The stew will naturally thicken as the moisture evaporate and let the flavors meld as it cools.
Right before serving, add the blanched broccoli to the stew to reheat. Simmer on low heat and do not boil. Once everything is nice and warm, serve the stew. Enjoy it with steamed rice or crusty bread.

Preheat the oven to 450ºF (230ºC). For a convection oven, reduce cooking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC).
Slice off the corn kernels.
Place the corn kernels on a rimmed baking sheet, saving the cobs for later.
Add olive oil, sprinkle of kosher salt, and paprika.
Mix all together with your hands and spread out evenly in a single layer. Roast the corn kernels at 450ºF (230ºC) degrees for 15 minutes. Once it's done, remove it from the oven and set it aside till Step 8.
Meanwhile, thinly slice the onion against the grain. Heat the butter in a heavy-bottomed pot (thicker at the base so it absorbs and distributes heat better).
Add the sliced onion and pinch of kosher salt and sauté until translucent.
Add the roasted kernels and water.
Add the reserved cobs in the pot as they naturally sweeten the soup. Push the cobs down to see if they are covered with water. If not, add more water.
Bring to a boil over medium heat. Cover and lower the heat to medium-low heat and simmer for 15 minutes. During this time I highly recommend skimming the foam on the surface for more refined taste. After 15 minutes, discard the cobs.
Using an immersion blender, blend the soup until creamy and smooth. If you use a food processor or blender, let the soup cool for a few minutes before you start blending to avoid major splashes. Make sure to cover the hole with a towel when blending.
If you want to make your soup similar to corn potage (Japanese corn soup), strain the soup through a fine-mesh sieve for a smoother consistency.
Transfer the soup back to the pot and add heavy cream and milk. The ratio is entirely up to you. Here I used equal parts of milk and heavy cream, 1 cup each. Bring back to a simmer and cook uncovered for 10 minutes or more, stirring frequently. Once the water evaporates and it’ll be more flavorful.
Add kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper. Make sure to taste the soup when you season. Finely chop parsley. Serve the soup hot or chilled. You can drizzle olive oil and/or heavy cream and sprinkle the parsley to garnish.

To Prepare Ingredients
Cut the potatoes into ¼ inch (6 mm) thick slabs and then cut into sticks. Soak the potatoes in water to remove the starch, for about 15 minutes.
Cut the onion into thin slices.
Cut the daikon into ¼ inch (6 mm) thick slabs and then cut into sticks.
Cut the carrot in half lengthwise, then cut into ¼ inch (6 mm) thick slices.
Scrape the gobo skin with the back of the knife. Gobo has a delicious earthy taste right below the skin; therefore, you do not use a peeler to peel off the soft skin. Cut the gobo in half lengthwise.
Thinly slice gobo diagonally. Soak in water for 15 minutes to get rid of the bitter taste. Optional: add a dollop of vinegar to the water to make the gobo white.
Cut the konnyaku into ¼ inch (6 mm) thick slabs, then cut into sticks.
Blanch the konnyaku in boiling water for 3 minutes to remove the smell. Drain konnyaku with a sieve.
Cut the pork belly slices into 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick pieces. Tip: If you freeze the meat for about ½ hour ahead of time, it is much easier to cut.
To Cook
All ingredients should be ready to go.
Press the “Sauté” button on your Instant Pot and heat 1 Tbsp cooking oil.
When the oil is hot, add the onion and coat with the oil. Then add the meat and stir to combine.
Add all the vegetables and konnyaku.
Stir to combine and then add in the dashi last.
Dashi should cover the ingredients. The vegetables will release moisture so don’t worry if you feel the soup is not enough at this stage. If dashi is not covering the ingredients, add more dashi (or water).
Press “Cancel” to stop the “Saute” menu. Close the lid and press the “Manual” or “Pressure Cook” menu. Then set HIGH pressure for 1 minute. Make sure the steam release handle points at “sealing” and not “venting”. The float valve goes up when pressurized.
While the ingredients in the soup are being cooked, you can cut the green onions and set aside.
When it’s finished cooking, the Instant Pot will switch automatically to the “Keep Warm” mode. Let the pressure release naturally for 30 minutes. If the valve hasn’t dropped yet, then quick release the air (be careful and cover your fingers with a mitten or kitchen towel).
Open the lid and check if the hard vegetables are tender.
Add miso. I used 8 Tbsp of Hikari Miso Enjuku Koji Miso.
Dissolve the miso in a ladle before releasing it to the soup. Make sure to taste the miso soup. If you added too much miso, add dashi (or water) to dilute. If it’s not enough, add more miso ½ Tbsp at a time.
To Serve
Pour the Tonjiru in a big bowl and sprinkle some green onions. Serve immediately. You can sprinkle shichimi togarashi or add a dollop of yuzu kosho for a spicy kick.
To Store
Let cool completely and store in the refrigerator for up to 3-4 days. When you reheat, make sure not to over boil the miso soup. Tip: The best way to store miso soup is actually to store the soup BEFORE adding miso. You can take out the portion you will need into another pot and then add miso to taste. That way, you will always have the best tasting miso soup every time.",en-US,4.84,,Just One Cookbook,60,6 serving(s),,,,,,,,,,,,

In a bowl, soak the oxtails in water for 1-2 hours. Change the water every half hour. This step will help removing blood from the oxtails.
Drain the water and transfer the oxtail to the Instant Pot.
Add 6 cups water (or just enough to cover the oxtail) and bring it to a boil. Instant Pot manual says not to cover when using Saute mode, but I use a glass lid from another pot (so I can see inside) and keep it covered until boiling. The lid is optional but it helps to speed up the boiling.
Press “Saute” button on your Instant Pot. Once boiling, remove the lid if using and cook for another 5-10 minutes.
Press the “Keep Warm/Cancel” button on the Instant Pot to stop “Saute” mode. Drain the water and clean the oxtail under running cold water. Set aside and clean the pot.
Cut the negi (or green onion) to separate green and white part. We only use green part for cooking the oxtail. Slice the ginger with skin on and smash the garlic.
In a cleaned pot, put the oxtail, negi (or green onion), ginger, and garlic.
Pour 8 cups water and add 1 tsp salt. Make sure the oxtail is submerged. If you use more than 2.5 lb oxtail, make sure that the water is not exceeding more than 2/3rd the capacity of the pressure cooker.
Cover and lock the lid on the pressure cooker. Make sure the steam release handle points at “sealing” and not “venting”. Press the “Manual” button to switch to “High Pressure” cooking mode. Press “plus” button to change the cooking time to 60 minutes.
If you’re using a stove-top pressure cooker, you won’t have any buttons to press. Just cook on high heat until high pressure is reached. Then reduce the heat to low but maintain high pressure for about 60 minutes.
When it is finished cooking, the Instant Pot will switch automatically to the “Keep Warm” mode. Let the pressure release naturally, about 15-20 minutes.
After de-pressurizing is completed, unlock the lid. Set a fine-mesh sieve over a large bowl and strain the broth. Discard the aromatics and add the meat back into the broth.
To Serve Now
You can’t get rid of the fat as much. Skim off the best you can. Use the broth and meat for the recipe you’re cooking. Otherwise, season the broth with salt (Tip: the right good amount of salt is important for taste). Serve the soup and meat in a bowl topped with green onion.
To Serve Later (Store Overnight)
Cover and let cool completely. Store in the refrigerator overnight (or at least 4 hours till fat solidified). Once the fat is solidified on the surface, remove the layer of fat. You can use it for other recipes or discard.
Transfer to the pot (or back to Instant Pot) and reheat the broth.
Use it for the recipe you’re cooking (and season accordingly). Or season with salt (Tip: the right good amount of salt is important for taste), and serve the soup with meat and chopped green onion or your choice of herbs.

To Prepare Ingredients
Clean the matsutake mushroom with damp paper towel. Because mushrooms act like a sponge, we try not to wash the mushroom. Shave off a thin sliver of the mushroom stem as if you are sharping a pencil with a knife. Cut into thin slices.
Tie mitsuba’s sprigs into a knot. If you use scallion, finely slice it.
To Make Dashi
Gently clean the dashi kombu with a damp cloth but leave the white powdery substances which contribute to the umami flavor in dashi. Do not wash the kombu.
In a medium pot, put the kombu in the water. Heat up slowly on medium-low heat. If you have time, soak for 3 hours ahead of time or preferably overnight. Kombu’s flavor comes out naturally from soaking in water.
When boiling, add the katsuobushi. Simmer for just 30 seconds and turn off the heat.
Strain the dashi through a fine-mesh sieve set over a bowl. Gently squeeze to release the extra dashi into the bowl.
To Make Soup
Transfer the dashi back to the saucepan and bring to a boil. Add the seasonings.
Cut tofu into small cubes and add to the soup. Then add sliced matsutake mushrooms and cook until ingredients are heated through, about 2-3 minutes.
Soak temari fu in water to hydrate. When temari fu is soft, squeeze water out and place it in a serving bowl.

Preheat oven to 425°F (218°C). For a convection oven, reduce cooking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC). Cut the cauliflower into florets and place them on a large baking sheet.
Drizzle with 2 Tbsp olive oil and sprinkle 2 tsp kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper.
Toss so that the florets are lightly coated with oil. Spread the florets out into a single layer on the baking sheet. Place the cauliflower in the oven, uncovered, for 20-30 minutes, or until the top is lightly golden brown.
When the cauliflower is done roasting, set aside.
While cauliflower is in the oven, cut a quarter inch off the bottom of the leeks, removing the roots completely and then slice the leeks in half lengthwise.
Rinse each half under running water. Use your fingers to flex the leek and rinse any dirt or sand that may be clinging between the layers while still keeping the layers relatively intact. Line up the halves and cut into ½ inch (1.3 cm) pieces.
Clean the cremini mushrooms with a slightly damp paper towel or kitchen cloth to remove any dirt. Remember mushrooms absorb water like sponges, and they won't brown nicely when cooked if they absorb too much water. If you have to clean a lot of mushrooms, quickly rinse with running water and pat dry with a kitchen towel. Do not leave the mushrooms in water.
In a large pot (I use a Dutch oven), heat 2 Tbsp butter (28 g) on medium heat. Crush 2 cloves garlic (or add 2 cloves minced garlic) into the pot. Tear a bay leaf in half (for more aroma & flavor) and add to the pot.
Once the ingredients become fragrant, add the chopped leek and ¼ tsp kosher salt and sauté until tender. The salt will help the leeks become tender faster.
Once the leeks are tender, add the cremini mushrooms and fresh thyme. Pinch the stem near the top with the fingers of one hand. Pinch down the length of the stem with the fingers of the other hand from top to bottom and the leaves should break off where they meet the stem.
When the mushrooms are tender, add 3 Tbsp all-purpose flour. Continuously stir the bottom of the pan so that the flour doesn't burn.
When you don't see any bits of flour, gradually add 2 cups (480 ml) milk while stirring the bottom of the pan. Then add 3 cups (720 ml) vegetable broth.
Add the roasted cauliflower and bring to a low simmer, NEVER a full boil. Once the soup reached to a low simmer, cover and simmer for 20 minutes (once again, don't let it boil!). Note: when you add milk to the soup, you don't want to boil the soup; otherwise the milk will curdle. Using full fat milk helps prevent curdling.
Turn off the heat and remove bay leaf. Puree the soup until it reaches your desired consistency with an immersion blender (or you can transfer to a blender). If you use a regular blender, fill it no more than half way with the soup (do in batches). Place the lid on the blender and cover the hole with a towel. Start blending and slowly lift up the towel to let some of the steam escape.
Add ½ to 1 cup sharp cheddar cheese and stir until melted. Taste the soup and season with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to your taste. If you need to reheat the soup, bring the soup to a low simmer on medium low heat, not a full boil. Serve and top with chopped chives and a dash of olive oil. Enjoy!

Select [Rice] using [MENU] button and set the steam time to 8 minutes. Press [COOK] button. When cooking is completed, warming will start. Fluff up the rice with a rice scooper. Tip: Adjust cooking time and water according to personal taste.
To Prepare Ingredients
Gather all the ingredients. Once we start cooking, we don't have time to measure, so make sure to prepare the seasonings ahead of time (1 piece Japanese curry roux, 1 Tbsp curry powder, 1 tsp garam masala, 1 Tbsp tomato paste, 1 ½ Tbsp mango chutney, and 1 Tbsp honey).
Dice the onion (It doesn’t have to be perfect).
Cut the carrot into small pieces. I recommend using the ""rangiri"" Japanese cutting method to increase the surface. It’ll help cooking evenly and faster⅔, and absorbing more flavors.
Mince the garlic and grate the ginger.
Discard the bottom of the shimeji mushroom stem. Roughly separate the mushrooms.
Pat dry the chicken with paper towel to remove any moisture. Season the chicken with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper.
To Stir Fry
Set cooker to [BROWNING FRY, level 6] for 30 minutes (you can add more minutes later on if you need extra time).
Heat 1 Tbsp oil and brown the chicken, skin side down, for 5 minutes each side, or until golden brown. Don’t crowd the pot and brown the chicken in batches, if necessary.
After the bottom side is nicely brown, flip to cook the other side. Then transfer the chicken to a plate and continue with the next batch. Set aside.
Add the diced onion and 1 Tbsp unsalted butter. Sauté until translucent, about 7-8 minutes.
Add the garlic and ginger and mix all together.
Add 1 piece Japanese curry roux, 1 Tbsp curry powder, and 1 tsp garam masala. Give it a quick stir.
Add 1 Tbsp tomato paste and sauté until fragrant.
Add 1 Tbsp honey and 1 ½ Tbsp mango chutney and mix all together.
Gradually add half the chicken broth, scraping the brown bits on the bottom of the pot. Transfer the chicken back to the pot.
Add the carrots, shimeji mushrooms, and the rest of chicken broth.
Add 1 Tbsp dry basil and 1 bay leaf. Gently mix all together.
To Pressure Cook
Close the lid and set cooker to [MULTI COOK, level 9] for 35 minutes. For Instant Pot directions, see Notes.
Once the pressure cooking is done, open the lid and stir. Add 1 tsp kosher salt and 1 tsp soy sauce.
Taste and adjust the flavor.
To Deep Fry Vegetables (Optional)
Lotus root: Slice thinly and soak in water (or ideally 2 cups water + 1 tsp of rice vinegar) for 10 minutes.
Bell pepper: Remove the seeds and cut into 4 wedges.
Okra: Remove the hard corners and cut in half lengthwise.
Kabocha: Thinly slice the kabocha (cut in half if it’s too big). If the kabocha is too hard to cut, microwave for 30 seconds or more if it’s still hard.
Potato: Cut into 6 to 8 wedges and soak in water to remove starch for 10 minutes.
Eggplant: Right before deep frying (otherwise it’ll change color), cut the eggplants in half and cut the skin side in criss-cross pattern. This creates a nice design and helps to absorb more flavors.
Make sure to remove moisture from all the vegetables with paper towel or kitchen towel before frying.
Add 1 cup of oil in a frying pan (I used a cast iron pan) or pot. Deep/shallow fry the vegetables at 350ºF (175ºC) and drain the excess oil on a paper towel or a wire rack.

To Prepare Hot Pot Broth
In your donabe (earthenware pot) or a large pot, add 3 cups (720 ml) dashi, ¼ cup (60 ml) sake, and ¼ cup (60 ml) mirin. Cover and bring the soup to a boil on medium heat.
Once boiling, add 2 cups (480 ml) warm soy milk. On medium heat, slowly heat up until the soup almost boils. Keep the lid uncovered and stir once in a while. Meanwhile, grind 2 Tbsp toasted sesame seeds in a pestle and mortar.
Once the soup is hot, add ¼ cup (4 Tbsp) miso and ground sesame seeds.
Taste the soup and add kosher salt if you like it saltier. Depends on the brands and types of miso, the saltiness of your soup will vary. I recommend making the soup a little bit saltier since you’ll add vegetables that will release water and dilute the soup. Turn off the heat and set aside. Keep it covered.
Hot Pot Ingredients: If your meat is not thinly sliced, you have to cut it thinly on your own. See how to do it (picture is thinly sliced beef).
Cut off and discard the bottom of enoki mushrooms and shimeji mushrooms.
Cut off and discard the shiitake stem. If you like, make a decorative cut on shiitake mushrooms.
Cut napa cabbage into 2” (5 cm) pieces widthwise. Then cut into 2-3 pieces lengthwise on the thick and white bottom part of napa cabbage so that it’ll be faster to cook.
Cut Mizuna (or spinach) and shungiku into 2” (5 cm) pieces.
Cut negi (long green onion or leek) into 1” (2.5 cm) thick pieces diagonally. Thinly slice green onion/scallion.
Cut the tofu block into 1” (2.5 cm) slices.
Using a vegetable peeler, peel the daikon and carrot thinly as if you are peeling their skin. You can cut these root vegetables into thinly rounds or quarters, but my family loves eating root vegetables in long paper-thin form.
Peel the gobo (burdock root) same way as daikon and carrot. Soak the thinly sliced gobo in water for 15 minutes to prevent them from changing color.
Put all the vegetables, mushrooms, and tofu in a platter.
Start cooking some of the tough/dense vegetables (the tough part of napa cabbage leaves, negi, tofu, mushrooms, daikon, carrot, and gobo) over medium heat, saving some for later batch as well as the leafy vegetables that will cook fast. Cover the lid so it will cook faster. Once the broth is simmering, reduce the heat to medium-low heat so the broth won't curdle. Simmer for 10 minutes, but make sure you won't let it boil. You can either start serving food that’s cooked. Root vegetables take a longer time to cook. Add the meat and leafy vegetables and cover to cook until the meat is no longer pink. Using a fine-mesh skimmer, skim any curdles floating on the soup. You can eat the curdle or discard it.
To Eat
Each person should have a small bowl of ponzu sauce and chopped scallions. Dip the cooked meat and vegetables in ponzu sauce to enjoy! Keep cooking the ingredients in the pot as you enjoy the meal.

To Make Homemade Ponzu and Sesame Sauce
If you are going to make homemade sesame and ponzu sauces, follow the recipe links in the ingredient list. You can make the sauces ahead of time.
To Prepare Broth
Fill a donabe (or Dutch oven or any large pot) two-thirds full with water. Add kombu and soak in water for at least 30 minutes. Meanwhile, you can prepare ingredients. The right image shows the kombu dashi broth after 30 minutes.
To Prepare Ingredients
Prepare udon noodles according to the instructions. Put frozen udon in boiling water and reheat for 1 minute. Transfer to iced water to stop cooking with remaining heat, and drain well. Serve on a plate and set aside. You'll add udon noodles to the donabe after all the ingredients are cooked and eaten.
Cut napa cabbages into 2-inch (5 cm) pieces, and then cut each piece into half or thirds.
Cut the shungiku into 2-inch (5 cm) pieces.
We only use the white part of negi (green onion/leeks). Cut it diagonally into ½ inch (1.3 cm) thick pieces.
Rinse enoki and shimeji mushrooms. Discard the bottom of both mushrooms and separate into smaller chunks.
Cut the stem of shiitake mushrooms and do a decorative cutting (optional).
Cut the carrot into ¼ inch rounds. If you like, you can use a vegetable cutter to create a flower shape.
Cut the tofu into 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick square pieces.
Arrange all the ingredients on a serving platter.
Peel daikon and grate using the grater (I love and use this one all the time). Squeeze grated daikon gently and put in a small bowl.
Cut the green onions into thin rounds and put it in a bowl.
Prepare shichimi togarashi in a bowl (optional). Lay the thinly sliced beef on a plate.
To Cook Shabu Shabu
Set a portable gas burner and put the donabe on the stove. Place platters with ingredients on the table. Give each person a ponzu sauce and sesame sauce. I also like to prepare an additional bowl for each person so they can use it to cool the food.
Bring the broth to a simmer over medium heat. Take out the kombu right before water starts to boil (otherwise, the water gets slimy).
Add the tofu, the tough part of napa cabbage and shungiku, negi, carrots, and some mushrooms. You don’t have to put all the ingredients and cook in batches. Cover to cook for 10 minutes.
To Eat Shabu Shabu
While you’re waiting for the food to cook, prepare your dipping sauces. Add grated daikon, shichimi togarashi, and green onion in ponzu, and green onion in sesame sauce.
When you want to eat meat, pick up a slice of thinly sliced beef with a set of communal chopsticks and stir the meat in the boiling broth to cook for 20-30 seconds, or until the meat is no longer pink. Do not overcook the meat.
Take out the cooked beef and vegetables from the pot when they are done, and dip the food in ponzu or sesame sauce.
Add remaining ingredients in the boiling broth as needed and simmer for a few minutes. Skim off the scum and foam from the surface as you cook. Prepare a fine mesh skimmer and a 2-cup measuring cup or bowl filled with water at the table so you can easily skim as you cook. Water in the measuring cup will help you get rid of scum from the skimmer. We want to keep the broth as clean as possible.
When all the ingredients are cooked, skim the broth for udon noodles. Typically, a hot pot meal ends with cooking udon noodles or porridge.
Add udon noodles in the pot and reheat for 1-2 minutes. Lightly season the udon soup with salt and white pepper, if you like (optional).

Combine cake flour and salt in a medium bowl to make the batter. Slowly add cold water (you may not need all of it!) and whisk till just combined. Do not over mix the batter because it’ll create gluten and the pancake won’t have a good texture.
Place a non-stick frying pan over medium high heat and add the oil when the pan is hot. Then spread out the scallions on the bottom of the pan and add the shrimps.
Drizzle the batter to cover the scallion and shrimp, and make sure there is batter between the ingredients so that they will be held together. However, don’t put too much batter either to avoid having doughy pancakes.
Lightly pour the beaten egg (I usually use half of one egg) over the batter. Cook for 3 minutes, until the edge of the pancake gets crispy and the bottom of the pancake is nice golden brown. Flip and cook for another 3 minutes, pressing down the pancake with spatula occasionally, until the pancake is crispy and golden brown. Flip one last time and cook for 30 seconds.

Wash the rice in a large bowl. Rice absorbs water very quickly when you start washing, so don't let the rice absorb the opaque water. Gently wash the rice in a circular motion and discard the water. Repeat this process about 3-4 times.
Let the rice soak in water for 30-60 minutes. This helps the rice absorb the seasonings later on and become more tender and moist after cooking. Transfer the rice into a sieve and drain completely for at least 15 minutes. Place the washed and drained rice in the rice cooker.
Meanwhile, prepare the other ingredients. Soak 3 dried shiitake mushrooms in a ½ cup of water for 15 minutes. I place a smaller bowl on top to keep the mushrooms submerged in the water at all times.
In a small saucepan, bring 2 cups of water to boil. Put ⅓ konnyaku and cook for 1 minute to get rid of the smell. Transfer the konnyaku to a plate to cool. Add the aburaage to the same pot of water and cook for 1 minute. This removes excess oil from the aburaage. Transfer aburaage to a plate to cool. Discard the water.
Shave off the gobo skin with the back of the knife. Don’t peel the gobo with a peeler to keep the earthy flavor and fragrance. Then make a “cross” slit on tip of the gobo as you see in the picture below.
Make a lengthwise cross-shape incision about 1 ½ inch (3.8 cm) deep at one end. Shave from that end as if you were sharpening a pencil with a knife while constantly rotating with the other hand. Soak in the water to prevent it from changing color.
Cut the carrot in half lengthwise and cut diagonally into thin slices. Then cut the slices into julienned or smaller pieces.
Cut the aburaage and konnyaku into thin small strips.
Cut the chicken thigh into ¾ inch (2 cm) slanted pieces. Hold your knife at 45-degree angle and slice the chicken. This “sogigiri” cutting technique gives the chicken more surface area so it will cook faster and soak up flavors quickly.
Squeeze the liquid from dried shiitake mushrooms and save the liquid (this is called Shiitake Dashi). Remove the stem and cut the caps into thinly slices.
Strain the Shiitake Dashi into a bowl through a fine mesh strainer to get rid of dirty particles. Set aside. In a measuring cup, add all the shiitake dashi and then pour dashi so you’ll have 1 ½ cup (360 ml) of liquid. Add it to the rice cooker and mix well.
Now your ingredients are ready!
Add 1 ½ Tbsp soy sauce and 1 ½ Tbsp mirin to the rice.
Pour the dashi & shiitake dashi mixture into the rice and mix well.
Add the chicken and evenly distribute over the rice. Do NOT mix the rice with ingredients. The rice won’t be able to absorb enough water to cook and it will end up with a hard texture. Continue from the hard ingredients to softer ingredients. Without mixing all up, start cooking the rice. If you have a “Mixed Rice” option, use it (See Notes below).
Once the rice is done cooking, use a rice paddle to stir the rice and vegetables with light slicing and tossing motions to distribute the ingredients evenly. The bottom of the rice gets slightly caramelized, and this part is called Okoge and it’s especially tasty.
Serve the rice hot or at room temperature. Sprinkle chopped mitsuba or green onion on top.

Soak the kombu in ¾ cup water. After 30 minutes, you now have cold brew kombu dashi.
Meanwhile, peel and cut the lotus root into ¼ inch pieces (0.6 mm). If you want to make lotus root into a flower shape, see the optional step below.

Gather all the ingredients. If your carrots still have some moisture after washing, be sure to pat them as dry as possible; the drier the vegetable, the better it will roast.
In a small bowl, mix together 1 Tbsp maple syrup, 1 Tbsp miso, and ½ tsp soy sauce.
Peel the carrots (and if they are large, cut uniform slices so that they will roast evenly and be finished at the same time). Place the carrots in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet lined with parchment paper (for easy clean-up). If the carrots are arranged too closely together or are on top of one another, they will steam, making them mushy rather than caramelized. Use a bigger baking sheet or 2 instead.
Drizzle the olive oil and sprinkle salt and pepper. You want each carrot to have a light coating of oil (the oil keeps some moisture in for that interior tenderness). A good rule of thumb is about 2 Tbsp of oil per baking sheet (I'm using a half sheet).
Toss/Roll the carrots with oil and seasoning.
Place in the oven and bake for 20-30 minutes, rotating the baking sheet halfway through to ensure that the carrots are getting equal exposure to the heat and have an equal chance at getting crispy and caramelized. The roasting time may vary depending on the size of the carrots (young thin carrots require less cooking time). When carrots are lightly browned and almost tender when pierced with a wooden skewer, remove the baking sheet from the oven. Why almost tender? We still need to roast for 5 more minutes after brushing the sauce.
Brush the maple and miso mixture over the carrots and flip to coat the other side. Put back in the oven to finish cooking, about 5 more minutes. The vegetables will start to brown on the bottom first (the side in contact with a hot surface will brown faster than the sides in touch with hot air), so for even browning you'll need to turn them.

The box says you do not need to soak, but I still recommend washing the koyadofu. Put the koyadofu in a bowl and pour hot water. The koyadofu will expand in about 10 minutes.
While you wait for the koyadofu to expand, put dashi in a pot. I use cold brew kombu dashi for this recipe, leaving the kombu behind. Add mirin and sake.
Add soy sauce, sugar, and salt.
Mix all together and slowly bring it to boil.
While waiting for the broth to boil, wash the koyadofu in clean cold water once it expands. Be careful with the koyadofu as the inside still contains hot water.
Like a sponge, let the koyadofu soak up the clean water and push it out a few times to clean. Hold the tofu flat between your hands. Squeeze the cloudy water from the inside of the koyadofu by pressing hard.
Change the water in the bowl several times to clean all the koyadofu. Thoroughly wash out the cloudy water by repeating this process several times. Give it a final squeeze.
Cut each koyadofu into 6 square pieces.
Once the dashi-soy broth is boiling, add the koyadofu and cover with a drop lid (Otoshibuta – if you don’t have one, make one with aluminum foil). You do not use a regular lid on top. Simmer for 10 minutes on medium-low heat.

Also, prepare a clean container with a lid for each vegetable. You can also put all vegetables (except for eggplants) in one big container.
Measure the Weight (Important!)
Decide the amount of salt you want to use and weigh the salt (Please read the blog post). This recipe is 5% brine (50 grams of sea salt in 1000 ml of water) and made double batch (100 grams of sea salt in 2000 ml of water) as I used a lot of vegetables to demonstrate.
Weigh each vegetable you’re pickling and write down the number. At the next step, you'll need to find out the weight of the heavy objects to put on the vegetables.
Figure out which heavy object to use. Make sure to include the plate that goes under the heavy object. The total weight (object + plate) needs to be 1.5 to 2 times of the total vegetable weight. You can use several plates, pie weights in a plastic bag, etc.
Prepare the Brine
Put the measured water and sea salt in the pot and let the salt dissolved completely over medium heat. You do not need to let it boil. You can turn off the heat once it’s warm and salt is completely dissolved. Let cool. Tip: In winter, it’s fast if you put the pot outside (leaving the lid slightly ajar). In summer, make the brine the previous day.
Cut the Vegetables (If Necessary)
Eggplants: Cut off the end of eggplants. When you are making Asazuke (quick pickles), cut the eggplant in half or cut a slit vertically about half the length in the eggplant to let the salt brine absorb. Otherwise, you don’t need to cut the eggplants. Place them in the container. Tip: To prevent the beautiful eggplants from discoloring, I used 'Lucky Iron Fish' - a cooking tool that retains colors and adds iron to foods. It is optional but worth investing especially if you need more iron in your diet. You can purchase it on Amazon. I also use 'Lucky Iron Fish' when I make Kuromame.
Cucumbers: You don’t need to cut. Place them in the container.
Daikon radish: Peel and cut in half or quarters vertically depending on its size. Place them in the container.
Celeries: Remove the leafy parts and cut into the length that would fit in the container. Place them in the container.
Carrots: Peel and cut into the length that would fit in the container. Place them in the container.
To Pickle Vegetables
Eggplants: Pour the brine until they are submerged.
Place a plate on top of the vegetable, and then put a weight on the plate. You can use plates and pie weights. Make sure the vegetables are completely submerged. Place a lid on and close tightly.
Cucumbers: Pour the brine until they are submerged.
Daikon radish: Pour the brine until they are submerged.
Celeries: Pour the brine until they are submerged.
Carrots: Pour the brine until they are submerged.
Pickling Time
Keep the tsukemono at room temperature for the best pickling. For my 5% brine, the best pickling time 8 hours. Tip: You can adjust the pickling time according to your preference. Dense vegetable takes longer time to pickle than less dense vegetables. Please read the blog post.
To Take Out and Serve
Remove the eggplants and Lucky Iron Fish from the brine and transfer to a clean airtight container or resealable plastic bag.
Remove other vegetables from the brine and transfer to a clean airtight container.
To Serve
Cut the tsukemono into slices when you are ready to serve.
Serve on a plate and enjoy!
To Store

Peel the sweet potatoes. Slice the sweet potatoes into ½ inch pieces (so that they will be cooked equally).
Soak the sweet potatoes in water for 15 minutes to remove starch. Then put them in a large pot and add water just enough to cover them.

Gather all the instructions.
To Prepare the Pork Belly
1.Roll up the pork belly, making sure one or both ends should have the “bacon” like appearance, showing the varying layers of meat and fat. If your slab comes with the skin (rind), it should be removed. Ask your butcher and they may remove it for you.
Run some butcher twine under the far end of the log. Tie a double knot to secure the pork tightly. Make sure you leave about 3 inches (7.5 cm) twine at the end.
Wrap around the pork belly 2-3 times around the same area to secure the end. Then pull the twine to the other end of the pork belly. Wrap around 2-3 times at the end area to secure before working toward the middle. Each wrap should be a ⅓ inch (1 cm) in between.
Continue wrapping around the pork belly toward the end (where you started). Make sure it’s wrapped as tightly as possible.
Once you reach the end, run the butcher twine under some wraps to hook and go back to the starting point. Find the 3-inch (7.5 cm) twine you leave behind.
Tie a double knot with the long twine and the 3-inch (7.5 cm) twine.
To Cut Aromatics
Cut off the green part of the long green onion and slice the ginger.
To Sear the Pork Belly
Heat the oil in a cast iron skillet (or regular frying pan) over high heat. Add the rolled pork belly in the pan.
Sear the pork belly one side at a time, rotating to make sure all sides are nicely seared.
It’ll take about 10-15 minutes all together.
To Prepare the Sauce
While searing, put all the ingredients for seasonings in a heavy-bottom pot that fits the chashu.
To Simmer Chashu
Transfer the seared chashu into the Dutch oven.
Bring the liquid to a boil.
Once boiling, skim off the foam and scum. Then turn the heat to low/simmer.
Put an otoshibuta (drop lid) on top to press the ingredient down. You do not need to use the regular lid and limit the evaporation by just otoshibuta. If you don’t have the otoshibuta, you can make it with aluminum foil (here’s how to make Otoshibuta).
Simmer on low heat, and cover with the otoshibuta at all times for the next 2 hours, rotating chashu every 30 minutes.
The sauce has been reduced. After 2 hours, turn off the heat to let cool a little bit.
To Rest Chashu Overnight
Once the meat is slightly cooled, transfer to a container or plastic food saver bag. Strain the leftover cooking liquid over a fine-mesh strainer. The liquid is roughly 2 ½ cup.
Add ½ cup of the cooking liquid into the bag.
Seal the bag with food saver. TIP: Fold a piece of paper towel to plug the entry of the Food Saver bag. This paper towel will absorb all the moisture when you seal.
I also made a quick ramen egg (ajitsuke tamago) with the leftover liquid. You make soft boiled eggs and add ½ cup of cooking liquid in the bag. Cover the cooking liquid and store chashu, ramen egg, and the cooking liquid in the refrigerator.
DAY 2
Open the bag of chashu.
Cut the twine with kitchen shears and remove them completely.
Slice the chashu into ¼ inch pieces (Keep the edge for chashu fried rice!).
Place the chashu slices on a ceramic plate and use a propane torch or broiler to sear the chashu slices to enhance the flavor. Then enjoy them immediately or serve on your ramen.
Scoop up the solidified fat from the cooking sauce.
Prepare a mason jar or container and strain the sauce over a fine-mesh sieve to make sure the solidified fat is left behind. The sauce will last for a month in the refrigerator. I use it for drizzling over the chashu and making stir-fries, marinade, and ramen eggs.
To Store
You can store the chashu in the refrigerator up to 7 days and 1 month in the freezer. I usually divide the rolled chashu into thirds and freeze 2 portions separately (for Ramen right away, and chashu fried rice and chashu Don for later). Ramen eggs should be consumed in 3-4 days if they are soft-boiled eggs and 7 days if hard-boiled eggs. The eggs get salty as you keep in the marinade, so remove from the sauce when they have the right taste.
FOR NON-ROLLED CHASHU
Gather all the ingredients. For small blocks of pork belly, you don't need to roll them up before cooking and simmering time is just 1 hour (instead of 2 hours).
Heat the oil in a cast iron skillet (or regular frying pan) over high heat. Sear the fat side down first, then flip over to sear all sides, which will take about 10 minutes.
While searing, put all the ingredients for seasonings in a heavy-bottom pot (or regular pot) that fits the chashu. Add the chashu and bring it to a boil, skimming the scum and foam. Then turn the heat to low/simmer.
Put an otoshibuta (drop lid) on top to press the ingredient down and limit the evaporation. If you don’t have an otoshibuta, you can make it with aluminum foil. (here’s how to make otoshibuta). Simmer on low heat for the next one hour, rotating chashu every 15 minutes (keep otoshibuta on all times!).
After one hour, there is ½ inch liquid left in the pot. Now you have 2 options. Option 1: If you're serving right away, remove the otoshibuta and further cook down the sauce on low heat until the sauce gets thicken and see the bottom of the pot when you draw a line with a spatula. Option 2 (recommended): Transfer the chashu to a container or a bag with a little bit of cooking sauce and refrigerate overnight. Strain the leftover cooking sauce and refrigerate.
To serve, slice the chashu into ¼ inch pieces. You can use a propane torch or broiler to sear the chashu slices to enhance the flavor. If you kept the chashu overnight and don't want to sear the chashu, you can reheat it by soaking in the hot cooking sauce.",en-US,4.61,,Just One Cookbook,640,8 serving(s),,,,,,,,,,,,

Gently whisk the eggs in a bowl. It's best to ""cut"" the eggs with chopsticks in a zig-zag motion and do not over mix.
In another bowl, combine the seasonings and mix well.
Pour the seasonings mixture into the egg mixture and whisk gently. Then pour the mixture into a measuring cup with spout and handle (so that it'll be easier to pour into the frying pan).
Tamagoyaki Pan Method
Heat the pan over medium heat, dip a folded paper towel in oil and apply to the pan. Put a little bit of egg mixture to see if the pan is hot.
When you hear the sizzling sound, pour a thin layer of egg mixture in the pan, tilting to cover the bottom of the pan.
Poke the air bubbles to release the air. After the bottom of the egg has set but still soft on top, start rolling into a log shape from one side to the other.
Move the rolled omelette to the side where you started to roll, and apply oil to the pan with a paper towel, even under the omelette.
Pour the egg mixture to cover the bottom of the pan again. Make sure to lift the omelette to spread the mixture underneath.

Dried Shiitake Mushrooms
In a small bowl, put dried shiitake mushrooms and 1 cup water and soak for 20-30 minutes, or until tender.
After 30 minutes or so, squeeze the liquid out from the shiitake mushrooms.
Cut the shiitake mushrooms into a hexagon, which represents turtle shape for longevity.
Strain the liquid through a fine-mesh sieve. This is called shiitake dashi. It yields roughly ¾ cup.
Chicken
Remove extra fat of the chicken and cut into 1 ½ inch (3.8 cm) pieces.
Transfer the chicken in a medium bowl and add ½ Tbsp sake and ½ Tbsp soy sauce. Coat the chicken with the marinade and set aside.
Burdock Root (Gobo)
Scrape the skin off the burdock root with the back of the knife. After rinsing, cut it into thin slices.
Prepare a bowl of 2 cups water and ½ Tbsp vinegar. Soak the burdock root in the water for 15 minutes.
Japanese Taro Roots (Satoimo)
Cut off the ends of taro. Then peel from one end to the other.
Ideally, taro should be a hexagon (6 sides) from the side view.
Cut the taro in half and soak in water. You can rub them with salt to get rid of the sliminess if that bothers you.
Bamboo Shoot
Cut the bamboo shoot into quarters lengthwise.
Cut the bamboo shoot in half widthwise. If each piece is still bigger than bite-size, you can cut in half.
Lotus Roots (Renkon)
Cut the lotus root into Hana Renkon.
The lotus root should resemble flowers after cutting the edges off.
Cut them into ⅛ inch (3 mm) slices. Prepare a bowl of 2 cups water and ½ Tbsp vinegar. Soak the lotus root in the water for 15 minutes.
Carrot (Nejiri Ume)
Peel the carrot and cut into ½ inch (1.3 cm) pieces.
Use a flower-shaped vegetable cutter and cut out each piece into a flower shape. Then make a shallow (roughly ¼ inch deep) incision from the center of the flower to in-between the two petals.
Hold a knife parallel to one petal and make a diagonal cut from right to left in-between petals.
This is called Nejiri Ume.
Konnyaku
Cut konnyaku into ¼ inch (6 mm) slices and then make a 1 ½ inch (3.8 cm) incision in the middle.
Put one end of konnyaku into the hole in the middle and pull it out. This is called Tazuna Konnyaku.
Snow Peas
Pull the strings at the seams of the snow peas and discard them. These are tough and not edible.
To Blanch Vegetables and Konnyaku
Boil water in a saucepan and blanch half of the flower carrot for 2 minutes and set aside.
Add a pinch of salt and blanch the snow pea pods for 30-60 seconds, until crisp but tender enough to eat.
Remove the snow peas from the water and transfer to the ice water to stop cooking and set aside.
In the same boiling water, add konnyaku. After boiling again, cook for 2-3 minutes to remove the smell.
Diagonally cut the blanched snow peas in half and set aside.
To Make Chikuzenni
In the large pot, heat 1 Tbsp of sesame oil over medium heat. When it’s hot, add the chicken.
Cook the chicken until it turns white. Transfer the chicken to a plate.
Add ½ Tbsp sesame oil and cook all the ingredients except the blanched snow peas and carrots reserved for decoration.
Stir and coat the ingredients with sesame oil.
Add dashi and shiitake dashi.
Bring it to a simmer over medium heat. Skim off the fat and scum that accumulates on the surface.
Add sake, mirin, sugar, soy sauce, and salt.
Add the chicken back into the pot. Bring it to a simmer. As you see, the stock should cover about 80% of the ingredients.
Put an otoshibuta (drop lid) on the ingredients and cook for 10 minutes. If you don't have one, you can make an Otoshibuta with aluminum foil.
Remove Otoshibuta and cook for another 10 minutes.
Insert a bamboo skewer into tough vegetables (taro root and lotus root) and see if they are tender. Taste and adjust seasonings if needed.
To Serve
Add the snow peas and remove from the heat. Cover, and let cool. Serve Chikuzenni in a serving dish or Osechi box. Top with the snow peas and blanched flower shaped carrots.
To Store
Keep the leftovers in an airtight container and store it in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. The flavor will intensify as time passes, so if you plan to serve it later, you may consider reducing the amount of seasoning. Nishime also freezes well, but konnyaku texture will change, so I recommend removing them before storing.

If your green beans are not trimmed, snap the tip of one end of the bean with your fingers and draw it down the length of one side of the bean to remove any possible string. Do the same thing with the other end, pulling it down the other side of the bean.
To Prepare Green Beans
Have ready a large bowl of ice water. Bring a large pot of water (3 QT) to a boil over medium-high heat. When the water is at a rolling boil, add 1 tsp salt, then green beans.
Cook until beans are just tender, 3 minutes for French green beans; 4 to 5 minutes for regular green beans. Taste test for doneness. They are done when they are just cooked through but still have the slightest crunch of texture. Drain the green beans immediately.
Transfer the green beans to the ice-water bath to make them greener and fresher. Drain again and set aside, or, if making in advance, dry them thoroughly with a clean dry towel and refrigerate in an airtight container for a day or two.

Rinse the rice under cold water, by gently rubbing the rice with your fingertips in a circling motion. Submerge the rice in water and pour out the starchy water. Rinse and repeat until the water becomes clear. Soak rice in water for 20-30 minutes. Meanwhile, start preparing the next ingredients. After soaking for 20-30 minutes, drain water completely and set aside for 10 minutes. If you don’t have time to wait, then shake off the excess water the best you can.
To Prepare Katsuo Dashi
Add 1 ½ cup water in a saucepan and bring it to almost boil. Add 1 cup packed katsuobushi to the water, reduce the heat, simmer for 30 seconds, and turn off the heat. Set aside and let the katsuobushi sink to the bottom, about 10 minutes.
Strain the dashi through a fine-mesh sieve over a liquid measuring cup. You need exactly 340 ml. If you don’t have enough, add water. If you have too much, then take it out. Tip: You can use used katsuobushi for Second Dashi (Niban Dashi) or make homemade furikake.
Add 2 Tbsp sake, 2 Tbsp usukuchi soy sauce (or regular soy sauce), and ½ tsp kosher salt. Usukuchi soy sauce (lighter color soy sauce) will not darken the rice as much as regular soy sauce.
Mix well to combine and let the salt dissolve completely. At the end, you should have 400 ml of broth.
To Prepare Ingredients
Prepare boiling water and pour over the aburaage to remove excess oil. Cut in half first and then cut into thin strips. Squeeze excess water out.
Open the packaged bamboo shoot and cut in half. Some pieces may be bigger or smaller, but you will need 5.3 oz (150 g).
Then cut the halves into quarters. The key here is to cut into smaller pieces so it’s easy to eat with rice. I usually keep the tip of bamboo, roughly ¾ inch length as intact (a triangle shape looks cute for presentation).
Then for the rest of bottom bamboo parts, cut into thin slices.
To Cook Rice
The rice should be drained well by now. Add the rice into the donabe (or rice cooker/heavy bottom pot). Pour 400 ml broth you prepared, and make sure the rice is evenly distributed in the pot.
Evenly distribute the aburaage over the rice (DO NOT MIX with rice) and then bamboo shoot on top of aburaage (again do not mix with the rest). Rice needs to be steamed nicely and evenly and when it’s mixed with other ingredients, it will not be cooked.
If you’re using the Kamado-san, place the inner lid and then the donabe lid. Cook on medium-high heat (or medium for a professional stove) for 14 minutes.
Once it’s cooked, remove from the stove and set aside for 20 minutes.
Cooking with Rice Cooker
Choose “regular” or “mixed rice” mode and start cooking. If you use “regular” setting, let it steam for 10 minutes more to create “okoge” (burnt rice).
Cooking On the Stove
Bring it to boil on medium heat (you can peek to see if it’s boiling). Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook for 15 minutes, or until liquid is completely gone.

In a small pot, boil 1 ¾ (400 ml) cups water. Once boiling, add katsuobushi.
Mix together and turn off the heat. Set aside for 15 minutes. Then strain the katsuobushi with a fine-mesh sieve. Set the katsuo dashi aside for now. You can discard the katsuobushi or make furikake (rice seasonings) with the leftover katsuobushi.
Remove the seeds from the kabocha and microwave it for 2 minutes to soften the outer kabocha skin. You can skip microwaving if you have a sharp knife and the strength to cut through the skin.
Cut the kabocha into wedges, then equal 2” (5 cm) pieces. Remember, kabocha skin is edible and nutritious.
In a large pot, place the kabocha pieces in a single layer, skin side down.
Add dashi, sake, and sugar. Tip: Swirl the pot to mix the seasonings so you won't break the kabocha.
Cook on medium high heat and bring it to a boil.
Add soy sauce and salt, and swirl the pot again to mix the seasonings. If the liquid does not cover ¾ of kabocha, you can add a little bit of water. Bring to a boil again.
Once boiling turn down to medium-low heat to maintain the simmer. Cover with an otoshibuta (drop lid) and cook for 20-30 minutes (depends on size, and skin takes time to cook), or until the kabocha has a tiny thin crack near the skin (it’s a sign for doneness!). If you feel that liquid is evaporating too fast, you can cover the regular lid (and you still need to use otoshibuta).
Remove from the heat and let kabocha sit covered (with a pot lid) until cool, about 30 minutes. This helps kabocha absorbs more flavor as it cools. You can serve at room temperature or reheat before serving.

The rice to water ratio is 1 : 1.1 (or 1.2 ). Please read the blog post for a detailed explanation.
To Rinse the Rice
Overfill the plastic rice cooker cup (180 ml) and level off. In this recipe, I'm using 3 rice cooker cups (540 ml).
Add water just enough till it submerges all the rice. Then discard the water immediately. Repeat this process 2-3 times. Tip: Rice absorbs water very quickly when you start rinsing, so don't let the rice absorb the first few rounds of water.
Use your fingers to gently wash the rice in a circular motion for 10-15 seconds. Repeat this process 1-2 times.
Add water and discard the water. Repeat this process 1-2 times.
Repeat this process 2 more times.
When the water is almost clear, drain well. Tip: Use a fine-mesh sieve to drain and shake off excess water.
Transfer the drained rice to the rice cooker (I use the Zojirushi IH). Add water (600 ml for my 3 rice cooker cups).
To Cook the Rice
Soak the rice for 20-30 minutes (especially if you're using an older rice cooker). Select your menu and press ""Start"". Tip: Even though my rice cooker includes soaking time, I soak my rice for 20-30 minutes. Note: For this Zojirushi rice cooker, 3-cup ""regular"" white rice takes 55 minutes to cook, which already includes a 10-minute soaking time and 10-minute steaming time in the program.
Once the rice is done cooking, let it steam for 10 minutes (if your rice cooker does not include the steaming time). Open the lid and fluff the rice with a rice paddle.
To Store Cooked Rice
Transfer the rice in airtight containers and close the lid to keep the moisture in. Let cool completely before storing the containers in the freezer (read my tutorial post).",en-US,4.55,,Just One Cookbook,60,2 serving(s),,,,,,,,,,,,

In general, rice does not keep well in the refrigerator. I recommend freezing the leftover rice. I do so even when I save it for the next day.

Bring a pot of water to a boil. Even if your sesame seeds are toasted/roasted, it’s good to toast them again in a non-greased frying pan for a couple of minutes, gently jiggling the pan. Be careful not to burn them.
With a pestle and a mortar (or spice grinder), grind the sesame seeds, leaving some seeds uncrushed to add texture to the sauce.
Add soy sauce and sugar and mix it all together. The dressing looks more like a paste than dressing. Set aside.
To prepare the green beans. If your green beans are not trimmed, snap the tip of one end of the bean with your fingers and draw it down the length of one side of the bean to remove any possible string. Do the same thing with the other end, pulling it down the other side of the bean.
Add a pinch of salt and the green beans to the boiling water.
Cook the green beans for 4-5 minutes (3 minutes for French green beans/Haricots Verts) until they are bright green and tender but still crunchy.
Remove from the heat, place in a strainer, and quickly rinse them in cold water to stop them from cooking further (or you can transfer them to an ice-water bath). Shocking the green beans with cold water will help the beans stay green. You don’t need to chill them; the beans should still be warm. Drain or dry well with a clean towel and cut them into 2-inch long pieces.

Check the taste and add kosher salt if necessary. I added ¼ tsp salt.
To Prepare the Vegetables
Prepare all the ingredients. Make dashi; otherwise, use water instead.
Cut the sweet potatoes into ¼ inch slices (uniform smaller pieces will cook faster than larger pieces) and soak in water to remove starch. Drain and set aside.
Wash the gobo really well and peel it thinly with a peeler. Soak in water immediately to avoid color changes and change the water once. Drain and set aside.
Discard the seeds from kabocha and slice thinly.
You can either cut the carrot into ¼ inch slices or use a peeler to peel the carrot.
Cut the corn on the cob into 1-inch thickness.
Hold each asparagus, snap and discard the shorter bottom end. Cut the asparagus in half.
Cut the broccoli and cauliflower into florets.
Cut the napa cabbage into bite-size pieces.
To Steam
Pour the dashi in your steamer, cover the lid, and bring it to boil on medium-high heat. As a quick guide, dashi (or water) should be at least 1-2 inches to your steamer (pot). Insert the steamer basket. Make sure the surface of the dashi (or water) is not touching the basket. If it is, take out some water.
When steam is coming out from the pot strongly, reduce the heat to medium and place the hard vegetables such as sweet potatoes and root vegetables. I also added kabocha squash and corn here as the rest of ingredients are fairly fast to cook. Cover the pot and set timer for 5 minutes.
Then add “Flower” vegetables such as asparagus, broccoli, cauliflower, and the bottom part of the napa cabbage. I also added carrot peels here. Set the timer for 3 minutes.
Lastly, add the leafy part of the napa cabbage and mini tomatoes. Cook for 2 more minutes.
Insert a bamboo skewer to check the doneness of denser vegetables. If it goes through, it’s ready to eat! Stop the steaming when the vegetables are still a bit crunchy since the residual heat will continue to cook the vegetables.
Serve the steamed vegetables with Miso Sesame Sauce and enjoy! During the meal, you can continue to steam the vegetables. Keep an eye on the dashi/water inside the pot.

Cook the rice in the rice cooker, pot over the stove top or pressure cooker.
Let the cooked rice cool a little bit until you can hold rice without burning your hands. Do not let the rice completely cool down.
First, wet both of your hands with water so the rice won’t stick.
Then put some salt in your hands and rub to spread all around.
Scoop about a half cup of rice onto your palm.
Cover the rice with the other hand and gently form the rice into a triangle.
Make sure covering hand (my right hand) should be forming a triangle shape. When forming the onigiri shape, your hands should be just firm enough so the onigiri doesn't fall apart. You don't want to squeeze the rice too tight.
I use three fingers (thumb, index finger, middle finger) to cover the area to make a nice triangle shape. Then rotate onigiri to make a perfect triangle.
While you squeeze onigiri firmly with both hands, one of your hands has to press onigiri to keep a nice form.
Gently squeeze the center of triangle on both sides so there is a slight indentation (for grilling onigiri). Now onigiri is ready! You can tell I’m not a good onigiri maker – no matter how many years I have been practicing.
Lightly oil a cast iron skillet and put it on medium heat.
Grill onigiri until all sides are crispy and lightly browned. Don’t flip it quickly. Just work on one side at a time and avoid turning over frequently.

For Japanese short-grain rice, the ideal rice to water ratio is 1 : 1.1 (or 1.2), which is 10-20% more water. For easy American ""cup"" measurement, I used 25% in this recipe (rice to water ratio is 1 : 1.25). If you have a precise milliliter measuring cup or kitchen scale, use the following measurement. 200 ml water for 1 rice cooker cup (180 ml). 400 ml water for 2 rice cooker cups (360 ml). 600 ml water for 3 rice cooker cups (540 ml). 800 ml water for 4 rice cooker cups (720 ml). 1000 ml water for 5 rice cooker cups (900 ml).
Put rice in a large bowl. Rice absorbs water very quickly when you start washing, so don't let the rice absorb the unclear water. Gently wash the rice in a circular motion and discard the water. Repeat this process about 3-4 times. Drain to a fine-mesh sieve and shake off excess water.
In a heavy-bottomed pot with a tight-fitting lid, put well-drained rice and measured water. Soak the rice for 20-30 minutes before cooking.
To Cook Rice
Close the lid and bring it to a boil over medium heat. Take a quick peek to see if water is boiling (otherwise do not open the lid).
Once water is boiling, turn the heat to low and cook covered for 12 to 13 minutes, or until the water is completely absorbed (take a quick peek!). If you see there is water left, close the lid and continue cooking for a little longer.
Remove the pot (with the lid on) from the heat source and let it steam for another 10 minutes.
Fluff the rice with a rice paddle when it’s done.
To Store Rice
Transfer the rice in airtight containers and close the lid to keep the moisture in. Let cool completely before storing the containers in the freezer (read my tutorial post).",en-US,4.75,,Just One Cookbook,50,2 serving(s),,,,,,,,,,,,

To Prepare Sesame Sauce
In a frying pan (do not add oil), toast sesame seeds (2 Tbsp) until they are fragrant and starting to pop. Keep some distance from the heat and shake the pan to toast.
Transfer to a mortar (suribachi). Using a pestle (surikogi), grind the sesame seeds until 80% of the sesame seeds are ground (to keep the texture of sesame seeds).
Add soy sauce (1 Tbsp), mirin (1 Tbsp), and rice vinegar (1 tsp) to the sesame seeds.
To Prepare Gobo
Peel gobo skin with the back of a knife. Don’t use a vegetable peeler to peel gobo’s skin because the earthy delicious flavor is just right below the skin and you don’t want to peel it off.
Cut the gobo into 5 inches (12 cm), and then cut each piece in half. If it’s a very thick piece, you can cut that piece in half again.
Add 1 tsp rice vinegar (1 tsp) in the water (4 cups, 960ml). Soak gobo in vinegar water for 3 minutes so the gobo retains its color. Drain and set aside.
To Cook Gobo
Add gobo in the saucepan filled with water (4 cups, 960 ml). Bring it to a boil. Once boiling, lower the heat to medium and cook for 13-15 minutes, or until the gobo is tender but firm. Drain gobo and transfer to the cutting board.
To Dress with Sesame Sauce
Pound gobo with the pestle (surikogi or a rolling pin from end to end until the fibers are smashed. This allows the sauce to go through the fibers of the gobo. Then cut them in half (2.5 inches/6 cm pieces).
While gobo is still hot, transfer into the sesame sauce and coat well. Gobo can absorb the flavors when they are hot.

Using your hand, mix the ingredients and knead well until well combined.
Add sake a little bit at a time to combine with the sake lee mixture. See the consistency to see if you need to add more sake. Each sake lee brand may have a different consistency and you may not need all of sake (or you may need more). The consistency you’re looking for is similar to miso, not too loose not too hard.
Knead until kasudoko becomes paste form and then transfer to a glass container where you want to pickle your ingredients.
To Make Cucumber Kasuzuke
Gather all the ingredients for cucumber kasuzuke.
Sprinkle salt over cucumbers. The amount of salt used is 2% of the weight of cucumber. Here I use 500 grams of cucumbers; therefore, I’ll need 10 grams of salt. Using hands, rub the salt into the cucumbers.
Set aside for 1 hour. Salt will draw moisture from the cucumbers.
After 1 hour, dry the moisture on the cucumbers with a paper towel. And transfer the cucumbers into the misodoko.
Completely cover the cucumbers with misodoko.
Once the cucumbers are embedded, cover the container with the lid. Store in the refrigerator for half day (maximum 24 hours).
With clean hands, take out the cucumbers from kasudoko, leaving the sake lees in the container.
Slice the cucumbers and serve in a dish. Tsukemono is always served along with steamed rice and miso soup. Enjoy the cucumber kasuzuke within 3 days.

You can keep kasudoko in the refrigerator or freezer and re-use it for up to 6 months (depending on how often you use it, though).

Put the daikon in a resealable plastic bag and add saltwater. Remove air and seal tightly. Daikon has strong-smelling sulfur compounds and it gets quite smelly. If you decide not to use a resealable plastic bag, you will need a large airtight container such as a big jar that can include daikon, saltwater, and heavy objects on top of the daikon.
Put the bag in a tray to avoid any leakage and put a heavy object on top of the bag. Here I put a plate (to evenly distribute the weight) and pie weights. Set aside at room temperature overnight.
Day 2
To make Shio Koji Mixture, combine ½ cup shio koji and ¼ cup sugar in a 1-cup measuring cup (or bowl). Cut off the end of red chili pepper with a knife or a pair of scissors.
Take out and discard the seeds (typically, the Japanese do not include seeds and use just the pod for mild spiciness). Cut the red chili pepper into small rounds and add to the mixture.
Cut the kombu into thin strips and add to the mixture. Mix all together. Set aside.
Remove the heavy objects, and take out the daikon. Discard the salt water.
Wipe off the moisture on the daikon with a paper towel.
In an airtight container that fits the daikon, pour half of your Shio Koji Mixture on the bottom of the container. Put the daikon on top.
Add and distribute the rest of the mixture. Put the lid on and keep at the room temperature for 2-3 hours, then transfer to the refrigerator for 2-3 days.
When to Stop Pickling
You can start eating from the day you add Shio Koji Mixture. It’s up to you when you want to stop pickling. You can take out all the daikon after 1 day, for example. As time passes, moisture comes out more form the daikon and it gets slimy from kombu. When the daikon is pickled enough (to your liking), take them out and transfer to another airtight container to keep for a week or two. I usually take out and eat one daikon each day and finish all of it by the 3rd day.
To Serve
If you prefer to serve pickled daikon without koji (grain), you can quickly rinse under running water. Cut the daikon into ¼ inch (6 mm) slices and enjoy!
To Store
After taking out the pickled daikon from the mixture, you can keep it for up to 3-4 weeks.",en-US,-1.0,,Just One Cookbook,2895,1 serving(s),,,,,,,,,,,,

Wash the taro with water and drain. Cut both ends and peel the skin. Taro will be slimy so be careful when you’re handling with the knife.
Sprinkle kosher salt over the taro and rub it with your hands. Then rinse under cold water and then drain completely.
Place the taro in a large pot and fill up with water to cover the taro. Bring the water to boil.
Once boiling, reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes, or until the skewer goes through. Pre-blanching helps to absorb flavors when you simmer with seasonings. Drain and remove the sliminess under warm water.
Heat the oil in the pot. Add the taro and quickly coat with the oil. The oil helps lock in all the flavors inside the taro and prevent umami from going away. It also helps to keep the shape without breaking into pieces.
Add dashi, sake and sugar, and bring to boil. Skim if necessary.
Lower the heat and place otoshibuta (drop lid) and simmer for 5 minutes.
Remove otoshibuta and add soy sauce (adding soy sauce later helps the sweet flavors easily soak in). Place the otoshibuta back and simmer for 20-25 minutes (depends on the size of taro - mine is large). Lastly, add mirin and gently shake the pot to coat the taro with the sauce. Adding mirin toward the end gives a nice luster to the dish.

The first water should be drained as fast as possible since the dry rice would quickly absorb moisture. The first water is not clean and should not be absorbed.
Rinse the rice under cold water, by gently rubbing the rice with your fingertips in a circling motion. Submerge the rice in water and pour out the starchy water.
Rinse and repeat until the water becomes clear. Soak rice in water for 20-30 minutes. It's a must!
Here's how the rice looks before and after soaking for 20 minutes.
Drain water completely. Set aside for 10 minutes. If you don’t have time to wait, then shake off the excess water the best you can.
Transfer drained rice and measured the amount of water in the inner pot of the Instant Pot.
Make sure the rice is evenly distributed and flat. Close the lid.
Set HIGH pressure for 2 minutes. Make sure the steam release handle points at “sealing” and not “venting.” The float valve goes up when pressurized (it takes roughly 5 minutes to pressurize). When it’s finished cooking, the Instant Pot will switch automatically to the “Keep Warm” mode. Let the pressure release naturally for 10 minutes and then proceed with quick release (DO NOT EXCEED MORE THAN 10 MINS. I recommend setting a timer.) by turning the steam release handle to the “venting” position to let steam out until the float valve drops down. Hold a kitchen towel and do not place your hand or face over steam release valve. The steam should be left only a little bit after 10 minutes of natural release.

In a small bowl, combine 2 Tbsp miso, 1 tsp sugar, and 1 Tbsp mirin and mix well. Depending on the type of miso, it might be saltier or sweeter than mine. Adjust the flavor by removing/adding sugar. Set the sauce aside for brushing the rice balls later.
For serving the rice ball, keep 6 shiso leaves aside (they will be placed under the rice ball later). Roll up the rest of shiso leaves and cut into julienned strips.
Add shiso leaves and roasted white sesame seeds in the bowl of steamed rice. Using a rice scooper, fluff up the rice while you mix in shiso leaves and sesame seeds.
Prepare a small bowl of water and a plate of kosher salt, roughly 2 to 3 tsp. Wet your palms with water, dip your fingers into the salt and rub some of the salt lightly onto your palms. Then using a rice scooper, scoop 1/6 portion of the steamed rice (you should be able to make 6 rice balls).
Gently form the rice into a ball shape, and then flatten top and bottom. It should look like a thick disk shape.
Cut the parchment paper to fit the bottom of your frying pan and place it on the pan. Brush the oil on the parchment paper. Place the rice balls and start cooking on medium heat. Make sure to keep some distance between rice balls so they don’t stick to each other.
Cook the bottom of the rice for about 2.5 minutes. When it’s nicely brown, brush the oil on the top of the rice balls and flip to cook the other side for 2.5 minutes or until nicely brown.

Increase the marinate ingredients if you cook more than 4 eggs.
In a resealable plastic bag, combine soy sauce, mirin, and water. Tip 1: If you plan to make the ramen eggs in just a few hours of marinating, use 0-1 Tbsp water. Otherwise, start with 2-3 Tbsp water and taste before adding more water. You have to adjust the saltiness to your taste and how long you plan to marinade. Tip 2: To use the minimal amount of the condiments (as we have to discard after marinating), I use a plastic bag. If you use a container, you will need to double the amount of condiment to cover the eggs.
Bring water to a boil in a medium saucepan. There should be enough water to cover the eggs (should be 1 inch above eggs).
When boiling, take out the eggs from the refrigerator and carefully and slowly submerge the eggs into the boiling water with a mesh strainer/skimmer or ladle to prevent the eggs from cracking.
Immediately reduce heat to maintain a simmer (gentle boil) and cook the eggs for exactly 7 minutes. [Runny egg yolk - 6 to 6 ½ minutes. Custard-like egg yolk but not runny - 8 to 9 minutes.] Make sure the water is simmering, but not so hot that the eggs bounce around. If you want your egg yolk to be in the center, gently rotate the eggs with chopsticks once in a while for the first 3 minutes so the egg yolk will be in the center.
After 7 minutes, immediately take out the eggs and soak in the ice bath to stop them from cooking further. Let them cool for 3 minutes.
The soft boiled eggs are not completely hardened so gently peel the eggs.
Put the eggs in the sauce bag and close tightly. The eggs should be submerged in the marinade. Let them marinate overnight to up to 3-4 days in the refrigerator.
Take out the eggs and cut in halves to serve. Enjoy the eggs by themselves or use them as a ramen topping.

To Separate Watermelon Flesh and Rind
Cut the watermelon into 1-inch slices. Then cut each watermelon slice into 1-inch sticks.

To Cook Rice
1 rice cooker cup (180 ml, 150 g) yields roughly 330 g of cooked rice, which is roughly 1 ¾ US cups. One sushi roll requires ½ - ¾ cup (90-135 g) of sushi rice.
Put rice in a large bowl. Rinse the rice and discard the water immediately. Rice absorbs water very quickly when you start washing, so don't let the rice absorb the unclear water. Repeat this process 1-2 times.
Now use your fingers to gently wash the rice by moving in a circular motion.
Rinse and discard water. Repeat this process 3-4 times.
Repeat the rinsing process 3-4 times until the water is almost clear.
Transfer the rice into a sieve and drain completely.
Gently wipe the dashi kombu with a damp cloth (it's a traditional method but these days kombu is much cleaner). DO NOT wipe off the white powdery substances, which contribute to the umami flavor in dashi. NEVER wash the kombu.
Put the rice in the rice cooker bowl and add water (never hot or warm!) to just under the 3-cup line. If your rice cooker has a ""Sushi Rice"" mode, add water till that line. Place the kombu on top of the rice, soak rice in water for 20-30 minutes, and start cooking. If you don't have a rice cooker, cook rice in a pot over the stove, an instant pot, or a donabe. Tip: Since you add sushi vinegar to the cooked rice, the rice should be cooked a little bit on the firm side and the water to rice ratio for sushi rice should be 1 to 1 (instead of 1 to 1.1 or 1 to 1.2 for regular steamed rice).
To Make Sushi Vinegar
To make sushi vinegar, combine rice vinegar, sugar, and salt in a small saucepan and bring it to a boil over medium-high heat. Whisk until the sugar is completely dissolved. You can also put the ingredients in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave for 1 minute, or till sugar is dissolved. Set aside to let it cool.
To Make Sushi Rice
When the rice is cooked, moisten sushi oke/hangiri (a round, flat-bottom wooden tub) or a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, or a large moisten glass bowl. Transfer the cooked rice into the sushi oke and spread out evenly so the rice will cool faster. While it’s hot, pour sushi vinegar over the rice. Tip: If you're making more/less rice or using the sushi vinegar bottle, the required sushi vinegar for rice should be roughly 8-10% of the cooked rice weight.
With a rice paddle, slice the rice at a 45 degree to separate the chunks of rice instead of mixing. At the same time, you need to use a fan to cool rice so the rice will shine and doesn't get mushy.
Then gently flip the rice in between slices. Repeat this process until the rice is cooled to the temperature of human skin.
To Keep
Keep the rice covered with a damp towel (or paper towel) at the room temperature until ready to use.
To Store
Rice gets hard and dry in the refrigerator. Therefore, my recommendation (even you plan to use it soon) is to put sushi rice in an airtight container and store in the freezer for up to a month. You can defrost overnight in the fridge or microwave, but bring it to room temperature (not hot). If you really want to refrigerate, cover the container with a thick kitchen towel, so the rice will stay cool and safe, but not become cold.",en-US,4.58,,Just One Cookbook,100,5 serving(s),,,,,,,,,,,,

Add ¼ cup (50 g) short-grain rice in a bowl and rinse under running water while gently rubbing the rice with hands. Repeat until the water runs clear and drain.
Put the rice back in a donabe (I used a small Japanese earthenware pot) or a heavy-bottomed pot, add 250 ml of water, and cover with a lid. Soak the rice for at least 30 minutes. Tip: With the heavy-bottomed pot like a donabe, the heat is distributed not as strongly/directly as a regular pot, so you can cook rice evenly.
Bring the rice to a boil over medium-high heat. You can open the lid to check during this time.
As soon as it's boiling, gently mix with the spoon once, making sure rice is not stuck to the bottom of the pot.

To Make Rice Balls
First wet both of your hands with water in order to keep the rice from sticking to your hands. Gently tap 2-3 finger tips in kosher salt and rub to spread all around your palms (Why using salt? Please read Notes below). If you are using table salt, use half the amount as it is saltier than kosher salt.
Scoop out one portion into one hand. Then mold the rice with your hands by pressing it down gently to form a barrel shape (or any shape you like). Your hands should be just firm enough so the rice ball doesn't fall apart. You don't want to squeeze the rice too tight. Continue making rice balls with the rest of rice.

Overfill the plastic rice cooker cup (180 ml) and level off. In this recipe, I'm using my 2 rice-cup-size Kamado-san. You can also use a 3 rice-cup size Kamado-san.
To Rinse Rice
First, add water just enough till it submerges all the rice in the bowl. Then discard the water immediately. Repeat this process 2-3 times. Tip: Rice absorbs water very quickly when you start rinsing, so don't let the rice absorb the first few rounds of water.
Use your fingers to gently wash the rice in a circular motion for 10-15 seconds. Add water and discard the water. Repeat this process 2 times.
Now use your fingers to gently wash the rice in a circular motion for 5 seconds. Add water and discard it. Repeat this process 2 more times.
When the water is almost clear, drain well. Use a fine-mesh sieve to drain and shake off excess water.
To Add Water
Transfer rinsed rice to the donabe and add 400 ml of water. Gently shake the pot to flatten the rice and distribute the rice evenly in the pot.
[White Rice Water Amount]
1 Rice Cooker Cup: 200 ml, 2 Cups: 400 ml, 3 Cups: 600, 4 Cups: 800 ml, 5 cups: 1000 ml.
[Brown Rice Water Amount]
1 Rice Cooker Cup: 300-320 ml, 2 Cups: 570-600 ml, 3 Cups: 900 ml, 4 Cups: 1200 ml.
To Soak Rice
Place the lid (or both lids of Kamado-san) and soak the rice in the donabe for 20-30 minutes. If you're cooking brown rice, it requires 12 hours of soaking time. You can also add a pinch of salt to help reduce bitterness of rice (optional).
To Cook Rice
Set the donabe on the gas stovetop and turn the heat to medium-high (or medium for the professional stove). Cook for 14 minutes (or see the following cooking time for your rice cups) or turn off the heat 2 minutes after the steam starts puffing from the lid's hole for white rice.
[White Rice Cooking Time]
1 Cup: 11-12 minutes (medium heat), 2 Cups: 12-14 minutes (medium-high heat), 3 Cups: 13-15 minutes (medium-high heat), 4 Cups: 14-16 minutes (medium-high heat), 5 cups: 15-17 minutes (medium-high heat).
[Brown Rice Cooking Time]
1 Cup: 22 minutes (medium heat; turn off the heat 10 minutes after the steam starts puffing), 2 Cups: 28-30 minutes (medium-high heat; turn off the heat 13-15 minutes after the steam starts puffing), 3 Cups: 35-38 minutes (medium-high heat; turn off the heat 15-18 minutes after the steam starts puffing), 4 Cups: 41-43 minutes (medium-high heat; turn off the heat 17-19 minutes after the steam starts puffing).
To Let Rice Rest
Remove from the stove and let it stand with the lid on (both lids for Kamado-san) for 20 minutes, and 40 minutes for brown rice.

To Prepare Steamed Rice
You can also cook short-grain rice with a rice cooker, an instant pot, or a donabe.
Put the rice in a large bowl and gently wash the rice in a circular motion and discard the water. Repeat this process about 3-4 times.
Let the rice soak in water for 30 minutes. Transfer the rice into a sieve and drain completely, at least 15 minutes.
Combine the rice and water in a heavy-bottom pot. A heavy-bottom pot with a tight-fitting lid is recommended as it is thicker at the base so it absorbs and distributes heat better. Cover the lid and bring it to a boil over medium heat.
Once water is boiling, turn the heat to the lowest setting and continue to cook covered for 12 to 13 minutes, or until the water is completely absorbed. At 12-13 minute mark, take a quick peek and if you see there is any water left, close the lid and continue cooking for another minute or so.
Remove the pot (with the lid on) from the heat and let it steam for another 10 minutes. Then transfer the rice to a large plate or baking sheet lined with parchment paper (I use Sushi Oke). Fluff the rice with a rice scooper. Let the cooked rice cool a little bit until you can hold rice without burning your hands. However, do not let the rice completely cool down.
To Prepare Onigiri Fillings
While rice is being soaked and drained (45 minutes), prepare the onigiri fillings.
Salted salmon filling: Sprinkle kosher salt on both sides of the salmon fillet. Bake at 425ºF (218ºC) in a toaster oven or oven for 10-20 minutes. Japanese salted salmon is cooked till well done (more dry and flaky).
Break the cooked salmon into flakes and set aside.
Umeboshi filling: Place umeboshi (Japanese pickled plums) on a 10” x 10” sheet of plastic wrap. Fold in half and squeeze the seed out from each umeboshi. Discard the seeds and keep the umeboshi flesh.
Okaka filling: Put katsuobushi (dried bonito flakes) in a bowl and add 2 Tbsp soy sauce. Mix to combine. Katsuobushi should be moistened but not drenched in soy sauce.
Tuna mayo filling: Put drained canned tuna in a bowl and add 2 Tbsp Japanese mayonnaise and ½ Tbsp soy sauce. Mix to combine.
Seasoned kombu filling: Put the purchased seasoned kombu in a bowl for easy access later.
To Make Onigiri
Cut the nori sheets in thirds (⅓).
First, wet both of your hands with water in order to prevent the rice from sticking to your hands.
Then put some salt in your hands and rub to spread all around your palms. How much salt? I dip 3 finger tips in kosher salt shown in the picture below. If you are using table salt, use half amount as it’s saltier than kosher salt.
Scoop out a handful of warm rice (about ⅓ cup) into one hand. Create a small well (indentation) in the center of the rice. Put one kind of filling (about 1-2 tsp) inside. Then mold the rice with your hands around the well to cover your filling completely.
Press the rice around the filling to gently form the rice into a triangle. I use three fingers (thumb, index finger, middle finger) to make a triangle corner. Your hands should be just firm enough so the onigiri doesn't fall apart. You don't want to squeeze the rice too tight.
Wrap the onigiri with nori seaweed.
Place a little bit of each filling on top of onigiri so we know which kind it is.
Alternative Method of Making Onigiri
If you do not want to touch the rice at all, you can place a piece of plastic wrap in a rice bowl (or any small bowl) and put the rice on top. Sprinkle some kosher salt (remember, salt is used to preserve the rice for a long time here).
Pull the plastic wrap corners and twist a few times.
Form into a triangle shape with the same manner as I described above.
To Store
Onigiri (or any rice dish) gets hard when you refrigerate. The cold air makes the rice dry and hard (which is perfect for fried rice!). I don't recommend making onigiri ahead of time. But if you really need to, my trick is to wrap the onigiri with thick kitchen towels and store in the fridge.

Put rice in a large bowl. Gently wash the rice with cold water and discard water. Repeat this process about 3-4 times until water becomes almost translucent. Let the rice soak in water for 30 minutes. Transfer the rice into a sieve and drain for 15 minutes.
Bring a medium pot of water to a boil. Put chestnuts in boiling water, cover with the lid, and turn off the heat. Set aside for 30 minutes and drain (It’s easier to peel when they are still warm).
Using a knife, make an incision around the edge where the flat surface and bottom of a chestnut meets. Then start peeling the shell.
Then peel the inner skin completely and soak in a bowl of water for 10 minutes. Peel the rest of chestnuts and change the water a few times.
Put the rice, water, sake, and salt in a heavy bottom pot and lightly mix all together. Then place chestnuts on top.

Rinse the rice and drain well. For detailed instructions, click here.
Boil water in a small saucepan and pour on top of the aburaage. This will remove the oil in the aburaage (the manufacture’s oil doesn’t taste good, so this extra step will improve the flavor of the aburaage).
Cut in half lengthwise and slice thinly into strips.
Peel the ginger and cut it into julienned pieces.
Mix all the ingredients for the seasonings in a 2-cup measuring cup. Then add water to the seasonings so that the liquid totals 1 ½ cup or 360 ml (equal volume as rice).
Place the well-drained rice into the rice cooker. No rice cooker? You can also make rice in a pot over the stove, an instant pot, or a donabe. Pour the liquid into the rice cooker and mix well, and add ginger and aburaage on top. Do not mix. Rice cooks evenly when it is not mixed with other ingredients.

Make dashi if you don’t have it around already and let it cool to room temperature (you can place the pot with dashi in it over a bowl of iced water).
To Prepare Rice
In a large bowl, measure and add 2 rice measuring cups (360 ml). Rinse the rice under cold water, by gently rubbing the rice with your fingertips in a circling motion. Submerge the rice in water and pour out the starchy water. Rinse and repeat until the water becomes clear. Soak rice in water for 20-30 minutes. Meanwhile, start preparing the ingredients.
Here's how the rice looks before and after soaking for 20 minutes. Drain water completely. Set aside for 10 minutes. If you don’t have time to wait, then shake off the excess water the best you can.
To Prepare Ingredients
In a small bowl, add dried shiitake mushrooms and ¼ cup water. Put a heavy object on top so the shiitake mushrooms will be submerged under water. Let them soaked till tender or while you prep other ingredients.
Cut the chicken thigh into slanted, smaller bite-sized pieces. I use “Sogigiri” Japanese cutting technique to create more surface so it will cook faster. Add ½ Tbsp sake to remove any unwanted smell from the chicken.
Peel gobo skin with the back of a knife. You don’t use a vegetable peeler to peel gobo’s skin because the earthy delicious flavor is just right below the skin and you don’t want to peel it off. Cut the gobo in half lengthwise.
Thinly slice each half diagonally. Soak the gobo in water to prevent it from turning brown and to remove any astringent taste.
Cut the carrot in half lengthwise and thinly slice diagonally.
Pour hot water over aburaage to get rid of the excess oil. Some people skip this step as the oil is cleaner these days. I do it anyway. Cut in half lengthwise.
Cut the tofu pouch into thin slices and squeeze water out.
Roughly, you will need ⅓ cup each of sliced carrot, sliced gobo, and sliced aburaage.
By now shiitake mushrooms should be hydrated and tender. Squeeze them to remove the excess liquid in the bowl. We will use this reserved liquid “Shiitake Dashi”. Remove the stem from each shiitake mushrooms.
Thinly slice the mushrooms. If it’s a big mushroom, cut the slices in half.
In a 2-cup measuring cup, add 2 Tbsp shiitake dashi (the reserved liquid from hydrating shiitake mushrooms). If you are worried about small particles that are left in the liquid, you can strain the liquid using a tea strainer. Then in the same measuring cup, add 1 ½ Tbsp soy sauce, 1 Tbsp mirin, and ½ tsp salt.
Lastly, add dashi so that the seasoning is 360 ml.
In a large bowl, add chicken, shiitake mushrooms, carrot, gobo, aburaage, and the seasoning from the previous step. Mix well.
To Cook Rice
Transfer drained rice and make sure the rice is evenly distributed and flat.
Add the ingredients and seasoning liquid on top of the rice. DO NOT MIX rice and the ingredients. Try to evenly distribute the ingredients and flatten without mixing with rice.
Close the lid and click MANUAL. Set HIGH pressure for 2 minutes.
Make sure the steam release handle points at “sealing” and not “venting.” The float valve goes up when pressurized (it takes roughly 10 minutes to pressurize).
When it’s finished cooking, the Instant Pot will beep and switch automatically to the “Keep Warm” mode. Let the pressure release naturally for 10 minutes (10-minute natural release) and then proceed with a quick release by turning the steam release handle to the “venting” position to let steam out until the float valve drops down. DO NOT EXCEED MORE THAN 10 MINS. I recommend setting a timer. When you do a quick release, hold a kitchen towel and do not place your hand or face over steam release valve. The steam should be left only a little bit after 10 minutes of natural release.
Fluff the rice with a rice scooper immediately to avoid burning the rice on the bottom. Instead of “mixing”, try to “cut” the rice at a 45 degrees angle as you fluff.
Cut the mitsuba into small pieces. If you don’t have mitsuba, you can use green onion.

Please read and follow the black soybean package instructions. Some packages may say ""soak overnight"". My package directions say to soak 4-5 hours, so I soaked for 4 hours. For testing, I tried soaking the same brand of soybeans overnight, and the beans came out a bit too soft. So you may need to test to see how long you want to soak your beans.
To Prepare the Black Soybeans
Gently rinse the black soybeans (kuromame) under cold water a few times. The skin is very fragile, so try not to damage. Discard any beans that are damaged. Drain well.
Put the beans in the inner pot of Instant Pot. Add 4 cups of water to the pot and let them soak for 4 hours (or overnight, depending on your package instruction).
To make the black soybeans even darker, we cook the black soybeans with rusty iron nails in Japan (Read more in the blog post). If you use rusty iron nails, clean 2-3 nails, wrap in a cheesecloth and add in the pot. Optionally, you can purchase purchase “Lucky Iron Fish"" on Amazon and place it in the water.
To Cook the Black Soybeans in Instant Pot
After 4 hours of soaking, put the inner pot back to the Instant Pot (keep the iron fish in the pot). Add 1 cup sugar, 2 ½ tsp soy sauce, and ½ tsp kosher salt. Mix well.
Close the lid and set HIGH pressure for 15 minutes (It will take 10 minutes to pressurize). Make sure the steam release handle points at “sealing” and not “venting”. The float valve goes up when pressurized.
Once Pressure Cooking Is Done...
When it’s finished cooking, the Instant Pot will switch automatically to the “Keep Warm” mode. Let the pressure release naturally, about 45 minutes. Open the lid and take out the inner pot and remove the iron fish.
Pour the beans and sauce into a large airtight container. Let the beans cool uncovered.

To Make Kombu Dashi
In a saucepan, put water and kombu.
Slowly bring it to a boil. Once boiling, remove the kombu from the liquid (You can make Kombu Tsukudani with the used kombu). If you are not vegan/vegetarian, you can add a small amount of katsuobushi to make Awase Dashi for more flavors. Please see the instruction here. If you're using dashi powder, please read here.
To Make Savory Broth
In Kombu Dashi, add mirin and usukuchi soy sauce.
Mix together and once it boils, turn off the heat.
To Prepare Spinach
Rinse the spinach and boil a large pot of water.
When the water is boiling, add the salt and put the spinach in the pot from the stem side first because it takes longer to cook. After 15 seconds, you can push down the leafy part into the water and cook for 1 minute. (US spinach is tender than Japanese spinach, so it’ll cook faster).
Once the spinach is cooked through, pick it up quickly, roughly less than 1 minute.
Transfer to iced water and let it cool (but don’t leave the spinach too long as you will lose the nutrients).
As soon as it’s cooled, collect spinach and squeeze water out. If you like to serve as I do, collect the stem and put together. I like to serve both stem and leafy parts separately instead of mixing it up together.
Cut the spinach into 1 ½ inch lengths and squeeze the water out one more time.
Put the spinach in the airtight container and pour the sauce over.
Make sure the spinach is evenly distributed in the container and soak in the sauce. Put the lid on and let it soak in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour (3-4 hours ideally).
To Serve
Serve the spinach in a bowl and pour the sauce over. I like to make sure each bowl gets both spinach stem and leafy part. Love the dark and light color contrast to each other.
Sprinkle sesame seeds for vegan/vegetarian version, and bonito flakes for non-vegan/vegetarian version.

To Prepare Turnips
Cut off the leafy green tops from the turnips. For presentation, I left just ½ inch (1.3 cm) of the stalks attached to the turnips. Use the leafy tops for making a side dish or adding in miso soup.
Rinse the turnips well, especially the stalks.
Cut off the bottom of the turnips so they will stand upright. Then remove the turnip’s skin, peeling from the bottom to the top.
The turnips should look like this.
To Cook Turnips
In a medium saucepan, add dashi and bring it to boil over medium heat.
Add the turnips, cover with the lid and bring it to a boil again. Simmer on medium-low heat for 5 minutes and add sugar.
Add a little ¼ tsp salt and cover with lid. Continue to simmer on medium-low heat until tender, about 20 minutes.
To Make Soboro
In the meantime, add sake, sugar, and soy sauce in a large frying pan. Combine the sauce well.
Add the ground chicken and start cooking on medium heat.
Using a pair of long cooking chopsticks or wooden spatula, break the ground chicken into small pieces. Once the chicken is no longer pink and the sauce has reduced, turn off the heat and set aside.
To Assemble
When the wooden skewer goes into the turnip smoothly, turnips are tender and ready.
Add the seasoned ground chicken into the broth.
Mix well and taste the broth. Adjust the taste with salt if necessary.
To make a slurry, in a small bowl, add potato starch/cornstarch and water and whisk well to combine.
Reduce the heat of the broth and gradually add the slurry to the broth and mix well to combine. If the sauce is too thick, add more water. If too watery, let the liquid evaporate a bit more (or you can make more slurry and add to the broth).

Peel potatoes and remove the eyes.
Cut each potato in half lengthwise and then cut into rough chunks, about 2 inches cubes.
Transfer to a pot of cold water to soak for 2-3 minutes.
Drain water and rinse the potatoes under cold running water. Use a lid of the pot when draining, so the potatoes don’t fall off.
Add cold water about 1 inch above the potatoes. If you are not using Shio Koji, sprinkle a bit of salt into the water to season the potatoes. Put the lid on, leaving a small gap, and bring to a boil over medium-high (it’ll take about 10-15 minutes to boil).
Once boiling, reduce heat to medium (or even lower heat to maintain the boil). Cook the potatoes until tender, about 15 minutes (I usually cover the lid, slightly ajar, so water won't evaporate too fast.
Meanwhile, in a saucepan, heat the butter, heavy cream, and shio koji over medium-low heat. Turn off the heat and set aside to keep warm (you may need to reheat before adding to the potatoes).
When a skewer goes through the potato easily, turn off the heat. Drain the water completely.
Rinse under hot running water and drain. Repeat 1-2 times to wash away excess starch. Drain really well.
Put the pot back on the stove and let them dry for a few minutes on low heat. With a stainless steel potato masher, mash the potatoes until you have a creamy and even mash.
Pour the warm butter mixture over the mash and fold gently with a silicone spatula to combine.

For this recipe, I use a 3-cup size double-lid donabe rice cooker called Kamado-san.
To Make Fish Broth
Note: The fish broth can be made a day ahead and refrigerated. With a spoon, remove the inside of the fish head. Keep the main fish bones for the broth, but discard any tiny bones, the fins, and the tail.
Place the fish bones and head in a medium/large pot and fill up the pot with water, just to cover them.
Bring the water to a boil over medium heat. Once boiling, skim the foam and scrum with a fine-mesh skimmer. Lower the heat and simmer for 10-15 minutes while skimming occasionally. We want clean broth for the rice.
After 10 minutes of simmering, strain the bones and broth over a fine-mesh strainer placed over a large bowl or another pot. Discard the bones and head, and let the broth cool to room temperature.
To Make Tai Meshi
Rinse the short-grain rice (If you are not sure how to rinse rice, see this post) and drain well. Transfer to a donabe (I use a Kamado-san) or a medium pot.
In a 2-cup measuring cup, add soy sauce and sake first. Then pour the fish broth until the amount is 400 ml (should be 1 ¾ cup minus 1 Tbsp).
Add salt and mix well together. Then transfer to the donabe (pot).
Flatten the rice and add a piece of kombu on top. Put the lid on (for Kamadosan, put internal and external lids). Let the rice soak in the broth for 20-30 minutes.
Cook on medium-high heat (or medium heat on a professional gas stove) for 13-15 minutes.
If you are using a Kamado-san, remove from the heat 2-3 minutes after the steam starts puffing from the top lid (see left pic below). Each gas stove is different, so this is a good sign to follow. Let it stand for 20 minutes, without opening the lid.
To Serve
Shave off the skin of ginger with a knife and cut it into thin slices. Then cut it into thin julienned pieces.
Break the fish meat into smaller bite-size pieces. If the fish was in the fridge, you may want to reheat it in the microwave. Open the lid (double lids, if using Kamado-san).
Remove the kombu (you can discard or re-use it to make simmered kombu) and gently fluff the rice with a rice paddle.
Add half of the fish meat and julienned ginger and mix gently. Then transfer the rest of the fish meat to the rice. Garnish with the rest of the ginger on top. Serve into individual bowls and sprinkle some sansho pepper if you like. Enjoy!

Quickly rinse the green peas and rice and drain well ( to learn how to rinse rice).
In a medium saucepan, bring 2 cups (480 ml) water to boil and add ½ tsp kosher salt.
Add green peas and cook for 4 minutes, or until the peas are firm but tender (eat one and you’ll see). Remove from the heat and let the peas cool in the cooking liquid. This will prevent from getting wrinkles.
Once the peas are cooled down, reserve 1 cup (240 ml) of cooking liquid.
In a rice cooker bowl, put rice that has been drained well. Then add 1 cup of the reserved liquid. Add water to the rice cooker’s 2 cup line. Add ½ Tbsp sake and ½ tsp kosher salt and mix well. Place the kombu on top and start cooking the rice. For my family's preference, I usually add extra water, so in the image, you see the water is at 2 ½ cup line.
Once the rice is done cooking, discard the kombu.
Now we’re ready to add peas. The peas will change color with the remaining heat. Therefore, I recommend NOT to keep the rice in the rice cooker for a longer time (no more than 2 hours).

Separate egg whites and egg yolks into two different bowls. Put the bowl with egg whites in the freezer for 15 minutes. Why do we freeze egg whites? Please read 3 Tips to Make Perfect Meringue (Egg Whites) in this post.
In the meantime, add milk and vanilla to the egg yolks and whisk until thick and frothy.
Sift the cake flour and baking powder into the bowl.
Whisk to combine thoroughly (but do not over-mix) and set aside.
After 15 minutes, take out the bowl with egg whites from the freezer. The egg whites should be half frozen. Now start beating egg whites.
When the egg whites turn frothy and pale white, gradually add in sugar (roughly ⅓ at a time). Continue to whip the egg whites.
The egg whites will become glossier and firmer. Stop beating when you lift up the hand mixer and the egg whites stand right up with stiff peaks slightly bending over.
Heat the large non-stick frying pan to 300ºF (150ºC) over the lowest heat. Brush with cooking oil and lightly remove any visible oil (otherwise the pancakes will have a spotty pattern). Keep the heat on while you combine egg whites and egg yolk mixture.
Take ⅓ of egg whites and add to the egg yolk mixture. Whisk together (don’t worry too much about breaking air bubbles at this step).
Next, take half of the egg whites and add to the egg yolk mixture. Using a whisk, gently fold in without breaking the air bubbles in the egg whites. Why do we use a whisk instead of a silicone spatula? Please read 3 Tips to Make Perfect Meringue (Egg Whites) in this post.
Now transfer the egg yolk mixture into egg whites. Carefully fold in two mixtures together without breaking the air bubbles. Make sure to gently mix the batter thoroughly!
For my stove and frying pan, I kept 300 ºF (150 ºC) all times on low heat. Remember each pancake gets roughly 4 scoops of batter, so that’s a total of 12 scoops for 3 pancakes. Now, scoop the batter and place on the frying pan. My recommendation is to use a small ladle (or a serving spoon that’s bigger than a regular spoon - probably 2-3 Tbsp) and make a tall pancake. Next, stack one more scoop to the first pancake. Then move on to the next two pancakes giving each 2 small scoops.
By the time all 3 pancakes have 2 scoops, the surface of the batter is slightly dry already, so you can stack one more scoop on top, keeping it up high. In the bowl, you should still have roughly 3 scoops left (if you have slightly more, that’s okay).
Set timer for 6-7 minutes, add 1 Tbsp water in 3 empty spaces inside the pan and cover with the lid. Water keeps the pancake moist. Please note: the suggested time is just a guideline and it’s based on the stove and frying pan that I'm using.
After 2 minutes passed, open the lid, and add one more scoop for each pancake (or more scoops if you have more batter). Make sure to stack high, not wide. If the water has evaporated, add a little bit more. Cover with lid and cook.
After 6-7 minutes passed, using the offset spatula, lift the pancake VERY GENTLY. If you feel the pancake is stuck, don’t touch until they firm up a little. If you force it, the pancake will crack in the middle. When the pancake is ready, you can easily move the pancake.
Here is another set of images to show the process. Slightly pull the pancake to create an empty space and gently flip over with “rolling over” motion.
Add water in empty spaces and set a timer for 4 to 5 minutes to cook the other side on the lowest heat.
Once they are nicely browned, transfer the pancakes to your serving plates.
Place fresh cream on the pancakes and top with berries. Dust the pancake with confectioners’ sugar and drizzle with maple syrup. Enjoy!
Fresh Whipped Cream
Prepare an ice bath by putting ice cubes and water in a large bowl and placing a clean and dry mixing bowl over. Add heavy cream and sugar to keep cool.

I follow the 1 to 5 rice-to-water ratio for my Okayu recipe.
Rinse the rice in water, then drain. Repeat until the water runs clear.
Soak the rice in the pot for at least 30 minutes.
After 30 minutes, drain the water completely.
Then add 250 ml of water into the pot.
Cover the pot and bring to a boil over high heat.
When boiling, lower the heat to the stove’s lowest setting (make sure to use the right size of stove burner for your pot size). Open the lid and gently mix with the spoon once, making sure rice is not stuck to the bottom of the pot.
Cover the lid and simmer the rice for 30 minutes (Tip: With a good size pot and the lowest heat on the stove, the water should not boil over. If you cook with more water or your pot is smaller than my pot, you may want to cover the lid at a slight angle so the water doesn’t boil over). During this time, I never open the lid or mix the rice. (Tip: If you are worried, you can take a quick peek and make sure there’s enough water so the rice doesn’t burn the bottom of the pot. If necessary, you can stir the pot or add “hot” water. Otherwise, don’t touch the rice because you would end up breaking the nice shape of rice kernels.)
After 30 minutes, turn off the heat and let it steam for 10 minutes. The rice should be soft and thickened. If you want to add something, like a beaten egg or salt, this is the time to add.

Leave the unsalted butter and Japanese curry at room temperature.
To make the dough:
In a large bowl, whisk together bread flour (150 g), cake flour (50 g), kosher salt (3 g), and sugar (15 g).
Microwave the milk (125 ml) until warm to the touch, about 95ºF/35ºC. Then add in the instant dry yeast (3 g) and the warm milk.
Using the silicone spatula, combine the wet and dry ingredients together until it becomes a rough dough. [1-2 minutes]
Once the dough becomes a ball, add the unsalted butter (10 g) in the center of the dough and combine well until the butter is incorporated into the dough. At first, the dough will be sticky, wet, and oily and you might want to add more flour, but wait and try kneading a little longer. [2-3 minutes]
Once you don’t see any big chunks of butter, transfer the dough from the bowl to a lightly floured surface. Knead the dough until it becomes smooth and pliable. Read the tip on kneading below. [5 minutes]
Tip on kneading: Using the lower part of your palm, push out the dough. Then roll back up as if you’re drawing the number “8” with your hand. Rotate the dough 90 degrees every time you finish drawing “8”.
After drawing “8” a few times, bang the dough onto the work surface and fold it over away from you. This helps develop gluten (elasticity). Turn the dough 90 degrees and repeat drawing “8” again. Continue this process until the dough is smooth, supple, and silky.
When the dough is moist, smooth, and pliable, form a ball. Place the seam side down on the working surface and twist the ball a few times to close the seam.
Place the dough back into the bowl, seam side down, cover with plastic wrap, and let rise at 100ºF (38ºC) for 60 minutes, or until doubled in size (I used proof setting in my oven).
Dust your finger with flour and poke the center of the dough. If the dough doesn’t close up, it’s ready.
Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and gently punch/press it down.
Fold the dough into thirds widthwise.
Fold the dough into thirds lengthwise.
Turn upside down so the seam is facing down. Twist the dough to form a nice ball shape.
Measure the weight of the dough on a kitchen scale and divide the number by 8. Roughly cut the dough into 8 pieces.
Weigh each piece of dough and cut off the extra dough if it weighs more than you calculated.
Add the extra dough to the smaller dough piece(s). Hide the extra dough in the center of the small dough by pulling the dough from the side.
Twist the dough to seal the seam on your hand. Place the 8 dough balls on the baking sheet lined with a silicone baking mat (or parchment paper). Cover with plastic wrap, and let rest for 15 minutes at room temperature.
To form the curry bread:
Place the dough seam side up and flatten out each piece with your hand. Fold in thirds widthwise.
Fold in thirds lengthwise, and then turn it upside down so the seam side is on the bottom.
Flatten again, and flip so the seam side is up.
Roll out into a 3.5 inch (9 cm) circle using a rolling pin.
Cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 10 minutes. One by one, thin out the edges of the dough with your fingers, with the center thicker than the edges. The circle should be 4 inches (10 cm) in diameter.
Place the dough seam side up and put 1 to 1.5 Tbsp of curry paste in the center of the circle. Gather the opposing edges of the circle and fold the dough in half. Remember, KEEP THE CURRY OUT from the edges! It’s the most crucial part. If you didn’t read my post, read my tip #2 now in the post!
Tightly pinch the edges to seal well. If the edges are not pinched and pressed tightly, the seam might open up during proofing/deep frying.
Next, to double secure, fold the edges over to one side at least once, like folding a brown lunch bag. Press the edges again to secure.
Keeping the seam side on the bottom, put the bread back onto the silicone mat and cover with a damp towel while working on the rest of the dough.
Once all the dough has curry filling, crack the egg into a bowl and whisk well. Place the panko in a shallow bowl/tray. Using a pastry brush, coat the formed dough with egg and then panko.
Cover the bread with plastic wrap and let rise at 100ºF (38ºC) for 45-60 minutes or until 1.5 times its size (I used proof setting in my oven). If you touch the dough with your finger, the indentation will stay on the dough.
To deep fry the bread:
In a deep frying pot (I like using my 2.75QT Staub), heat the 4 cups (960 ml) oil to 320ºF (160ºC). Place 2-3 pieces of the curry bread into the oil, seam side down. After a few seconds, flip it around so the seam side is now up. You may need to hold it with a pair of tongs. Keep turning them while they deep fry, until they cook to a golden brown, about 2-3 minutes. Drain the oil well and transfer to the wire rack or some paper towels to drain while it cools. Serve hot or at room temperature.

Remove from the heat. Season lightly with salt and pepper and vigorously stir in the lemon juice and egg yolk (reserve the egg white for later). Transfer the mixture to a bowl and allow to cool.
Once the spinach is cool enough to handle, squeeze out as much liquid as possible and roughly chop. (I realize that it seems counter-intuitive to put liquid in then squeeze it out, but after countless test runs this process led to the best results.) Return spinach to the bowl and thoroughly mix in the feta.
Preheat the oven to 400°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Roll out the puff pastry to a rectangle about 1/8 inch thick and 12 by 18 inches. Cut into 6 even 5 to 6 inch squares.

Quickly rinse the salmon under cold water and pat dry with a paper towel. Slice the salmon diagonally if it’s not pre-sliced.
To Prepare Salmon
Evenly distribute sake on the salmon and coat well. Set aside for 10 minutes.
After 10 minutes, pat dry the salmon with a paper towel.
First, sprinkle and apply some kosher salt on the skin first.
Then sprinkle the remaining salt on both sides of the fillets. If you have leftover salt, use it on the skin.
Line the bottom of an air-tight container with a paper towel. This will absorb excess moisture from the fish.
Place the fillets in the container in a single layer and lay a sheet of paper towel on top of the fillets.
Then put the 2nd layer of the fillets on top of paper towel and lay another sheet of paper towel on top. Cover with lid and keep in the refrigerator for at least 2 days.
This is after 2 days. You will see moisture on the salmon skin.
Gently pat dry the fillets with a paper towel to get rid of any excess moisture.
To Store
If you don’t plan on cooking the salmon right away, after drying the fillets with a paper towel, wrap the individual pieces with plastic wrap and place them in a freezer bag to freeze. You can store the salmon in the freezer for up to 1 month. Remember to defrost completely before cooking.
To Broil (Recommended)
Preheat the broiler* with a rack placed about 6"" (15 cm) away from the top heating element (in the center of the oven) for 5 minutes. When broiling, you don't control the temperature in the oven; instead, you control the distance between the broiler and the surface of the food. It's similar to using hotter and cooler zones on your grill. *Broiler setting: Low (450ºF/232ºC), Medium (500ºF/260ºC), and High (550ºF/288ºC). I usually use medium or high.
Line a baking sheet with foil for easy cleaning. Place the salmon on the foil, skin side up (for crispy skin!). Broil the salmon at medium (500ºF) or high (550ºF) for 8-10 minutes. Please remember the cooking time varies depending on the thickness of the fish and the distance between the broiler and the food. Japanese salted salmon is cooked till well done (more dry and flaky). You do not need to flip it.
To Bake (Optional)

I have 2 videos for this recipe: the hand-kneading method and the stand mixer method.
Step 1 - Making Main Dough
In a large bowl, combine 225 g (1 ¾ cup + 2 Tbsp) bread flour, 25 g (3 ½ Tbsp) cake flour, 40 g (3 Tbsp) granulated sugar, and 3 g (1 tsp) kosher salt.
Add 4 g (1 tsp) instant dry yeast and 1 large beaten egg to the bowl with dry ingredients.
Add 50 ml (3 ½ Tbsp) milk and 50 ml (3 ½ Tbsp) water, both at 86ºF (30ºC). Using a silicone spatula or your fingertips, gently mix the ingredients together until they are combined.
In the beginning, the dough is very sticky and wet, but keep mixing until it forms a loose, sticky ball. Also, use the dough to pick up the flour on the sides of the mixing bowl. This step should take about 2 minutes. Transfer the dough from the bowl to a lightly floured work surface.
Press the heels of your hands into the dough, pushing forward slightly. Fold the top half of the dough in half back toward you. Then rock forward on the lower part of your palm to press it flat.
Turn the dough slightly (to clockwise), fold it in half, and rock into it again with the lower part of your palm. This process is called ""punching"" the dough and the goal is to lengthen and stretch the gluten strands in the dough. Repeat for 5 minutes or so. Tip: If the dough doesn't seem to be losing its stickiness, sprinkle more flour over the top and work it into the dough. You can lightly dust your hands with flour to keep the dough from sticking too much.
After “punching” for 5 minutes and the dough gets more elastic, press and stretch the dough, about 10 inches (25 cm). Then put small cubes of 35 g (2 ½ Tbsp) unsalted butter on top of the dough. Roll up the dough tucking the butter in, and then continue the kneading process.
Your hands, dough, and the work surface will get oily and messy in the beginning. Don't’ be panic. I recommend using a metal/silicone dough scraper to collect the dough stuck on the work surface once in a while and keep kneading.
As you knead, the dough will absorb the butter and it will eventually become very smooth and easier to work with. Finally, start banging the dough onto the work surface and fold it over away from you. This helps develop the gluten (elasticity). Bang the dough, turn it 90 degrees, and “punch” it, using the lower part of your palm. Continue this process for 10 minutes or until the dough is smooth, supple, and silky. Tip: Don’t let go of the dough when you are banging onto the work surface and don’t let it rest for too long between turns.
When the dough gets silky and smooth, pull the end of your dough with your thumb and fingers. Keep spreading the dough with your fingers, stretching the dough into thin translucent membrane. This test is called Windowpane Test to see if the dough's gluten has been developed enough. If the dough tears, the gluten isn’t quite ready yet. Knead the dough for another 2 minutes and test again.
Shape the dough into a ball by pulling all sides of the ball to the bottom and pinching them together. Place the dough in a bowl (the seam on the bottom).
Cover the bowl with a plastic wrap and let the dough rise in a warm place until the dough has doubled in size, about 1-2 hours. I use a Proof setting (100ºF/38ºC) in my oven.
Step 2 - Making the Biscuit Dough
In a large bowl, add 60 g (About 4 Tbsp) unsalted butter and mix with the silicone spatula until it becomes smooth.
Add 100 g (½ cup) granulated sugar and mix with the silicone spatula until they blend well together.
Slowly add a very small amount of 1 large beaten egg (46-50 g/ml) into the bowl and blend well together before you add another small amount of the egg. Continue until all the egg is well blended.
Sift 200 g (1 ⅔ cup) cake flour and 2 g (½ tsp) baking powder into the mixture.
Using the silicone spatula, mix well until the dough is not floury. Collect the dough and make it into a ball.
Measure the weight of the biscuit dough. It should be around 400-410 g. Remember the weight as you’ll need it later (to measure ⅒ of the dough).
Roughly cut the dough into 10 pieces.
Starting from the big piece, measure the weight again till it weighs ⅒ of the total weight (in my case, 40-41 g). If it’s heavier, pinch off the dough and add the extra dough to a smaller dough, by stuffing the extra into the inside of the smaller dough.
Roll the 10 pieces of biscuit dough into 10 balls. Place them on a baking sheet lined with a silicone baking mat or baking sheet. Cover with plastic wrap and rest in the refrigerator for 10 minutes until it hardens a bit.
Step 1 - Making Main Dough
In a stand mixer bowl, combine 225 g (1 ¾ cup + 2 Tbsp) bread flour, 25 g (3 ½ Tbsp) cake flour, 40 g (3 Tbsp) granulated sugar, 3 g (1 tsp) kosher salt, and 4 g (1 tsp) instant dry yeast. Whisk all together.
Set your mixer with a dough hook attachment.
Add 1 large beaten egg and 50 ml (3 ½ Tbsp) milk and 50 ml (3 ½ Tbsp) water, both of which have been kept at 86ºF (30ºC), to the bowl with dry ingredients.
Start kneading on low speed (speed 2). Use a silicone spatula to scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl a couple of times.
Continue to knead until it clings to the hook and cleans the sides of the bowl.
Once the dough starts to come together, add the butter and continue to mix at low speed until the butter has been incorporated. Then increase speed to medium and knead until the dough is silky, smooth, and elastic.
When the dough gets silky and smooth, pull the end of your dough with your thumb and fingers. Keep spreading the dough with your fingers, stretching the dough into a thin translucent membrane. This test is called Windowpane Test to see if the dough's gluten has been developed enough. If the dough tears, the gluten isn’t quite ready yet. Knead the dough for another 2 minutes and test again.
Shape the dough into a ball by pulling all sides of the ball to the bottom and pinching them together. Place the dough in a bowl (the seam on the bottom).
Cover the bowl with a plastic wrap and let the dough rise in a warm place until the dough has doubled in size, about 1-2 hours. I use a Proof setting (100ºF/38ºC) in my oven.
Step 2 - Making the Biscuit Dough
In a clean stand mixer bowl, add 60 g (About 4 Tbsp) unsalted butter and 100 g (½ cup) granulated sugar.
Mix until well blended and smooth.
Slowly add a very small amount of 1 large beaten egg (46-50 g/ml) into the bowl and blend well together before you add another small amount of the egg. Continue until all the egg is well blended.
Sift 200 g (1 ½ cup + 2 Tbsp) cake flour and 2 g (½ tsp) baking powder into the mixture.
Mix until it’s incorporated and the dough is not floury. Then take out the dough and form it into a ball.
Measure the weight of the biscuit dough. It should be around 400-410 g. Remember the weight as you’ll need it later (to measure ⅒ of the dough).
Roughly cut the dough into 10 pieces.
Starting from the big piece, measure the weight again till it weighs ⅒ of the total weight (in my case, 40-41 g). If it’s heavier, pinch off the dough and add the extra dough to a smaller dough, by stuffing the extra into the inside of the smaller dough.
Roll the 10 pieces of biscuit dough into 10 balls. Place them on a baking sheet lined with silicone baking mat or baking sheet. Cover with plastic wrap and rest in the refrigerator for 10 minutes until it hardens a bit.
Step 3 - Shaping the Main Dough
Once the dough has doubled in size, dust your index finger with flour and put it in the center of the dough. If the hole doesn’t close, then the dough is ready for the next step.
Remove the dough with a silicone dough scraper and transfer to a lightly floured work surface. Press the dough with your hands to release gas in the dough and deflate.
Fold the dough in thirds and then fold in thirds again. Flip to keep the seam side on the bottom. Shape the dough into a ball. To close the seam line, rotate the dough (clockwise) with both hands while the seam line is touching the work surface.
Measure the weight of the main dough. It should be around 460-470 g. Remember the weight as you’ll need it later (to measure ⅒ of the dough).
Using a dough scraper, roughly cut the dough into 10 equal pieces. Starting from the big piece, measure the weight again till it weighs ⅒ of the total weight (in my case, 46-47 g).
If it’s heavier, pinch off the dough from the center and add the extra dough to a smaller dough, by stuffing the extra into the inside of the smaller dough. Knead to combine well. Shape each dough piece into a nice round ball, pulling from all the sides and tuck into the bottom. Place the dough on your left (right) palm, and rotate it with your right (left) hand, keeping the seam side on the bottom.
Put the dough on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. Cover the dough with plastic wrap (I use a portable cupcake holder lid) to prevent it from drying. Rest the dough for 15 minutes at room temperature.
Step 4 - Final Shaping
Put the biscuit dough on the lightly floured work surface and flatten the dough with your hand.
Using a rolling pin, roll out into 4 inch (10-12 cm) flat rounds. Continue the rest until the main dough is ready.
After 15 minutes of resting, flatten the main dough with your hand and fold in thirds.
Then fold in thirds one more time and pinch both ends to shape the dough into a ball.
Pull the dough from all sides towards the seam on the bottom. Place the dough on your left (right) palm, and rotate it with your right (left) hand a few times, keeping the seam side on the bottom.
Place the biscuit dough on your palm and put the main dough in the middle, seam side facing up.
Then flip to show the biscuit dough on top. Gently pull all sides of the biscuit dough wrapping around the main dough.
Coat the biscuit dough with granulated sugar (2 Tbsp) and remove the excess sugar. Then using a dough scraper or knife, gently score the biscuit dough into a crisscross pattern (I score 3 lines each side).
Place the dough on the baking sheet, seam side on the bottom. Cover the dough with plastic wrap to prevent from drying.
Let the dough rise in a warm place until the dough rises one and a half (1.5 x) in size, about 50 minutes (I used the Proof setting (100ºF/38ºC) in my oven).
When the dough has risen halfway, preheat the oven to 350ºF (180ºC). Note: If you are using the oven for proof, you have to transfer the dough to a warmer place so you can preheat the oven.
Step 5 - Baking
Bake at for 13-15 minutes. Toward the end of baking if you see the bread is not being browning evenly, rotate the bread once so that the bread gets an even color.
Once the bread is baked, transfer to a wire rack. Let it cool for 5 minutes, and enjoy!

Gather all the ingredients. This is for the Basic Avocado Toast. Toast a slice of Shokupan (Japanese pullman loaf bread).
Cut the avocado in half by running the knife around it. Twist.
If you are using only half an avocado, keep the one with seed for later. I use this avocado keeper to avoid oxidation. You can also squeeze lemon juice on the surface.
Smack the seed and remove it. Scoop the avocado flesh with a spoon.
Mash avocado with a fork and squeeze the lemon. Mix all together.
#1 Basic Avocado Toast
Transfer the mashed avocado onto a toasted shokupan. Press the avocado gently to evenly distribute with a fork. Season with freshly ground black pepper and flaked sea salt.
Drizzle sesame oil over the avocado. Serve immediately.
#2 Avocado Toast with Furikake

#3 Avocado Toast with Japanese Mayo or Spicy Mayo and Shichimi Togarashi
Instead of mashed avocado, you can serve with sliced avocado. Peel the avocado skin, and cut the avocado into ¼ inch slices.
Gently pressed to stagger and squeeze the lemon to coat the avocado with lemon juice.
Transfer the sliced avocado to a toasted shokupan, drizzle sesame oil over the avocado, and season with flake sea salt.
To make spicy mayo, mix Japanese mayo and sriracha sauce. If you don’t like spicy mayo, simply use just mayo. Drizzle Japanese mayo or spicy mayo on top of the avocado slices and sprinkle Shichimi Togarashi on top. Serve immediately.
#4 Avocado Toast with Ramen Egg
Transfer the mashed avocado onto a toasted shokupan. Press the avocado gently to evenly distribute with a fork. Drizzle sesame oil and season with flake sea salt.

You will also need a 12-inch non-stick frying pan (large enough to cook 3 pancakes at the same time) with a lid.
Make Fresh Whipped Cream
Prepare ice bath by putting ice cubes and water in a large bowl and placing a clean and dry mixing bowl over. Add heavy cream and sugar to keep cool.
Whisk on high speed until medium to firm peaks form. The whipped cream should not be runny, but soft and fluffy firm. Keep it chilled until you're ready to serve the pancakes.
Make Pancakes
Separate egg whites and egg yolks into two different bowls. Put the bowl with egg whites in the freezer for 15 minutes. Here's why (Read ""1. Chill egg whites (What?!)"").
In the meantime, add milk and vanilla to the egg yolks and whisk until thick and frothy.
Sift the cake flour and baking powder into the bowl. Because we add matcha powder, make sure to remove 1 tsp (3 g) cake flour after you measure ¼ cup.
Whisk to combine thoroughly (but do not over-mix) and set aside.
After 15 minutes, take out the bowl with egg whites from the freezer. The egg whites should be half frozen. Now start beating the egg whites.
When the egg whites turn frothy and pale white, gradually add in sugar. Continue to whip the egg whites.
The egg whites will become glossier and firmer. Stop beating when you lift up the hand mixer and the egg whites stand right up with soft peaks slightly bending over.
Heat the large non-stick frying pan to 300ºF (150ºC) over the lowest heat. Brush with cooking oil and lightly remove any visible oil (otherwise the pancakes will have a spotty pattern). Keep the heat on while you combine egg whites and egg yolk mixture.
Take 1/3 of egg whites and add into the egg yolk mixture. Whisk together (don’t worry too much about breaking air bubbles at this step).
Next, take half of the egg whites and add to the egg yolk mixture. Gently fold in without breaking the air bubbles in the egg whites.
Now transfer the egg yolk mixture into egg whites. Carefully fold in two mixtures together without breaking the air bubbles. Make sure to gently mix the batter thoroughly!
Remember each pancake gets roughly 4 scoops of batter, so that’s a total of 12 scoops for 3 pancakes. Now, scoop the batter and place on the frying pan. My recommendation is to use a small ladle (or a serving spoon that’s bigger than a regular spoon) and make a tall pancake. Next, stack one more scoop to the first pancake. Then move on to the next two pancakes giving each 2 small scoops.
By the time all 3 pancakes have 2 scoops, the surface of the batter is slightly dry already, so you can stack one more scoop on top, keeping it up high. In the bowl, you should still have roughly 3 scoops left (if you have slightly more, that’s okay).
Set timer for 6-7 minutes, add 1 Tbsp water in 3 empty spaces inside the pan, and cover with the lid. Water keeps the pancake moist. Please note: the suggested time is just a guideline and it’s based on the stove and frying pan that I'm using.
After 2 minutes passed, open the lid, and add one more scoop for each pancake (or more scoops if you have more batter). Make sure to stack high, not wide. If the water has evaporated, add a little bit more. Cover with lid and cook.
After 6-7 minutes passed, using the offset spatula, lift the pancake VERY GENTLY. If you feel the pancake is stuck, don’t touch it until they firm up a little. If you force it, the pancake will crack in the middle. When the pancake is ready, you can easily move the pancake. Slightly pull the pancake to create an empty space and gently flip over with a “rolling over” motion.
Add water in empty spaces and set the timer for 4 to 5 minutes to cook the other side on the lowest heat.
Once they are nicely browned, transfer the pancakes to your serving plates. Place fresh cream on the pancakes and top with berries. Dust the pancake with confectioners’ sugar, a light sprinkling of matcha powder and drizzle with maple syrup. Enjoy!",en-US,4.44,,Just One Cookbook,30,3 serving(s),,,,,,,,,,,,

See Notes))', '1 large egg (50 g w/o shell)', '3 Tbsp whole milk', '3 Tbsp water ((3 Tbsp + 1 tsp to be precise; keep at 86ºF/30ºC, See Notes))', '2 ½ Tbsp unsalted butter ((cut into small cubes))', '10 oz red bean paste (anko)', '1 large egg (50 g w/o shell)', '2 Tbsp water', '2 tsp toasted black sesame seeds']","Gather all the ingredients.
In a large bowl, combine bread flour (225 g; measure 2 cups and remove 2 Tbsp), cake flour (25 g; 3 ½ Tbsp), granulated sugar (50 g; ¼ cup), kosher salt (4 g; 1 tsp), and dry yeast (3 g; 1 tsp).
Beat 1 large egg in a small bowl and add to the bowl with dry ingredients.
Add milk (50 ml; 3 Tbsp + 1 tsp) and water (50 ml; 3 Tbsp + 1 tsp), both of which have been kept at 86ºF (30ºC).
Using your fingertips or a wooden spoon, gently mix the ingredients together until they are combined. In the beginning, the dough is very sticky and wet, but keep mixing until it forms a loose, sticky ball. Also, use the dough to pick up the flour on the sides of the mixing bowl. This step should take about 2 minutes.
Sprinkle a clean, stable surface with flour and transfer the dough from the bowl. Press the heels of your hands into the dough, pushing forward slightly. Fold the top half of the dough in half back toward you. Rock forward on the lower part of your palm to press it flat. Turn the dough slightly (to clockwise), fold it in half, and rock into it again with the lower part of your palm. This process is called ""punching"" the dough and the goal is to lengthen and stretch the gluten strands in the dough. Repeat for 5 minutes or so. Tip: If the dough doesn't seem to be losing its stickiness, sprinkle more flour over the top and work it into the dough. You can lightly dust your hands with flour to keep the dough from sticking too much.
After “punching” for 5 minutes and the dough gets more elastic, press and stretch the dough for 10 inches (25 cm). Then put small cubes of unsalted butter (35 g; 2 ½ Tbsp) unsalted butter on top of the dough. Roll up the dough tucking the butter in, and then continue the kneading process.
Your hands, dough, and the working surface will get oily and messy in the beginning. I recommend using a metal/silicone dough scraper to collect the dough stuck on the working surface.
As you knead, the dough will absorb the butter and it will eventually become very smooth and easier to work with.
When the dough becomes smooth, start banging the dough onto the counter and fold it over away from you. This helps develop the gluten (elasticity). Bang the dough, turn it 90 degrees, and “punch” it, using the lower part of your palm. Continue this process for 10 minutes or until the dough is smooth, supple, and silky. Tip: Don’t let go of the dough when you are banging onto the counter. Don’t let it rest for too long between turns.
Near the end, pull the end of your dough with your thumb and fingers. Keep spreading the dough with your fingers, stretching the dough into the thin translucent membrane. This test is called ""windowpane."" Test to see if the dough's gluten has been developed enough. Your dough is now ready to rise. If the dough tears, the gluten isn’t quite ready yet. Knead the dough for another 2 minutes and test again.
Shape the dough into a ball by pulling all sides of the ball to the bottom and pinching them together.
Place the dough in a bowl (the seam on the bottom) and cover with plastic wrap. Let the dough rise in a warm place until the dough has doubled in size, about 1-2 hours. I use a Proof setting (100ºF/38ºC) in my oven.
Once the dough has doubled in size, dust your index finger with flour and put it in the center of the dough. If the hole doesn’t close, then the dough is ready for next step.
Press the dough with your hands to release gas in the dough and deflate.
Fold both sides of the dough toward center.
Then fold in thirds toward the middle. Flip, keeping the seam side on the bottom.
Shape the dough into a ball, rotating (clockwise) with both hands while the seam line is touching the work surface.
Using a dough scraper cut the dough into 8 equal pieces. If you need to adjust the size of dough, pinch off the center of the big dough and add to the center of the small dough and knead to combine well.
Shape each dough piece into a nice round ball, pulling from all the sides and tuck into the bottom. Place the dough on your left (right) palm, and rotate it with your right (left) hand, keeping the seam side on the bottom.
Put the dough on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. Cover the dough with plastic wrap to prevent it from drying. Rest the dough for 15 minutes at room temperature.
After resting, flatten the dough with your hand, fold in thirds twice (just like you did earlier), and shape it into balls.
Press the dough so stretches to 3 inch (8 cm) diameter. Then put 35 g of red bean paste in the middle of the dough. Then pull all sides of the dough around and wrap the red bean paste tightly to seal.
Pinch the seam very well and put the seam on the bottom. Place the dough on your left (right) palm, and rotate it with your right (left) hand a few times, keeping the seam side on the bottom. Put the dough back into the baking sheet, seam side on the bottom.
Cover the dough with plastic wrap to prevent it from drying. Let the dough rise in a warm place until the dough has doubled in size, about 30 minutes (I used the Proof setting (100ºF/38ºC) in my oven). When the dough has risen halfway, preheat the oven to 400ºF (200ºC). For a convection oven, reduce cooking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC). Note: If you are using the oven for proof, you have to transfer the dough to a warmer place so you can preheat the oven.
In a small bowl, add 1 egg and 2 Tbsp water and whisk very well. Using a pastry brush, brush all sides of the dough with an egg wash.
Put 2 tsp black sesame seeds in a small bowl. Dip the flat round side of a rolling pin (about ¾ inch (1.9 cm) diameter) in the egg wash and black sesame seeds and stamp on top of the dough. Alternatively, you can simply sprinkle the black sesame seeds on top.
Bake at 400ºF (200ºC) for 13-15 minutes. Toward the end of baking if you see the bread is not being browning equally, rotate the bread once so that the bread gets equal color.
Once the bread is baked, transfer to a wire rack and let it cool. Serve warm or at room temperature immediately. Enjoy!

Gently rinse the dried lily flower buds, wood ear mushrooms, and shiitake mushrooms with tap water and transfer them into three bowls. Add 1/2 cup hot water to each bowl to cover. Let soak until tender throughout, 30 minutes or so. Once done, squeeze out the marinating liquid back into the bowls and gently rinse them with tap water again to remove any dust on the surface. Slice the shitake mushrooms. Cut the lily flowers in half. And chop the wood ear mushrooms into small pieces. Reserve the marinating liquid from the shiitake mushrooms and lily flowers for the gravy.
Prepare gravy
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the Sichuan peppercorns. Cook, stirring occasionally, until you can smell a strong fragrance and the peppercorns turn darker (but not black). Scoop out the Sichuan peppercorns and discard them (*Footnote 1).
Add the rehydrated lily flowers, shiitake mushrooms, and wood ear mushrooms. Cook, stirring frequently, for 1 minute or so. Be careful, the rehydrated ingredients might cause oil splatter.
Add the white part of the green onion and the ginger. Cook and stir for 30 seconds to release the fragrance.
Move everything to one side of the pan and add the remaining 1/2 tablespoon oil to the other side. Add the ground pork on top of the oil, then use a spatula to spread it out. Let the pork cook for a minute without moving to brown the bottom, then cut it into small pieces.
When the pork is cooked through, pour in the Shaoxing wine and scrape the pan to release any brown bits.
Pour in the light soy sauce and dark soy sauce. Stir to coat well.
Add the water and the reserved 1 cup of soaking water. And the chicken bouillon powder. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally, and cook for 2 minutes.

Break the eggs into a liquid measuring cup and add the salt. Beat the eggs with a fork until they are smooth, but not airy. Check the volume measurement of the beaten eggs, it should be about 1/2 cup.

Cut butter and shortening into 1/2” (1 cm) squares and put them in a medium-sized bowl. Transfer into freezer until hard, 15 minutes or so.
Line a strainer mesh srainer over a large bowl. Sift the flour over the strainer. Add the baking powder and salt. Stir to mix well.
Once the butter and shortening are fully chilled, add them into the flour mixture. Cut with a pastry cutter or using your fingers, until the mixture is mealy with some pea-sized chunks of butter.
Pour in the cold buttermilk. Stir with a spatula until a craggy dough forms. Add most of the green onion, saving about 2 to 3 tablespoons of it for garnish.
Lightly knead the dough in the bowl with your hand until it forms a dough ball, about 1 minute.
Chill the dough in the freezer for about 10 minutes, or cover with plastic wrap and chill in the fridge until ready to use.
Cook the biscuits
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (232 C).
Dust your working surface with a thin layer of flour. Transfer the chilled dough onto it. Press the dough into a flat square. Cut the dough in half and fold it over itself. Repeat one more time.
Roll the dough with a rolling pin into a 1” (2.5 cm) thick sheet. Use a biscuit cutter to cut the dough into circles or you can use a knife to cut the dough into 2” (5 cm) squares. If using a biscuit cutter, you will have leftover dough. Gently gather the leftover dough together and press it until it just becomes one piece of dough (The more you handle the dough, the less it will rise during baking). Cut it into more biscuits.
Brush the top of the biscuits with a thin layer of milk.
Bake for 13 to 16 minutes, until the top turns light golden and the bottom turns golden brown.
Gravy
Add the char siu drippings into a small saucepan. Heat over medium heat until hot.
Add the flour. Stir immediately until it’s fully incorporated.
Gradually add the stock, a few tablespoons at a time, and whisk constantly. It should start to form a thick paste. Once the paste turns smooth, add more stock and keep whisking. Continue until all the stock is fully incorporated with the flour.
Keep stirring and cooking, until the sauce has thickened enough to coat your spatula.
Add the char siu and the soy sauce. Cook for another minute until the meat is heated through. Taste the gravy. Add a pinch of salt and stir to mix well, if needed.
To serve
Sprinkle the remaining green onion onto the gravy and serve it with the fresh biscuits.

Combine the eggs, salt, sugar, soy sauce, and Shaoxing wine in a large deep bowl. Blend with a hand mixer until smooth. This can be done with a whisk or fork, but it will take longer and won’t be as smooth. You can do this in a traditional blender, but it will introduce a lot of air so you’ll have to let the eggs settle for 30 minutes or so.
Moisten the inside of a heatproof glass container (mine was about 5” x 5”) with some water. Carefully line the inside with plastic wrap - the moisture inside should help the plastic wrap stick nicely. You want as smooth a surface as possible.
Pour the egg mixture through a strainer into the glass dish, avoiding adding foam as much as possible. Skim the foam from the surface of the egg mixture.
Set up a steamer and steam the egg mixture for 9 minutes. Remove the glass container and let the steamed eggs cool completely in the fridge, 5 to 6 hours.
Assemble
Combine the miso honey mayo ingredients in a small bowl and stir until smooth.
Add the frying oil into a small skillet until it just reaches half the height of the steamed egg. Heat over medium heat until it reaches 375°F (190°C).
Remove the steamed egg patty from the glass container and plastic wrap, being careful not to crack it. Trim off the edges so that it fits the size of your bread.
Set up the flour, beaten egg, and panko on 3 separate plates. Coat the steamed egg in flour, then in a thin layer of egg, then press it into the panko on both sides.
Add the coated egg patty into the hot oil and fry it until golden-brown on both sides, 1 minute per side. Place the fried egg patty on a wire rack or paper towel to drain. Season with salt and pepper if desired.

Prepare a large bowl with a mesh strainer on top. Sift the flour into the bowl.
Combine the water, baking powder, and baking soda in a small bowl. Stir to mix well.
Add the water mixture, egg white and salt into the flour. Stir with a fork until a coarse dough forms.
Knead the dough for 5 minutes. Cover the dough with plastic wrap and let it rest for 30 minutes.
2nd Rise
On a clean working surface, knead the dough the second time for another 2 minutes. Cover it with plastic again and let it rest for at least 2 hours or overnight in the fridge (*See Footnote 1).
Make donuts (see the blog post above for step pictures)
While heating the oil, prepare the donut dough: Divide the dough into two even pieces. Work on them one at a time.
On a lightly oiled surface, roll the dough into a long strip. You can use your hands to hold both ends of the dough and stretch it gently so it’s easier to form a long shape. Once the dough is 4” (10 cm) wide and 1/4” (0.5 cm) thick, cut off both ends so it forms a rectangle.
Cut across the rectangular sheet, making 1” (2.5 cm) width 4” (10 cm) rectangles.
Dip a skewer or the back of a knife into water. Press it into the center of half of the rectangles. Place the unpressed strips on top of the the pressed strips and press into the center again, so the two pieces of dough are attached to each other. (*Footnote 2)
Once the donuts are formed, let them rest for another 10 minutes.
Fry the donuts
Heat a tall medium-sized pot with 3” (7 cm) of oil over medium heat until it reaches 375 °F (190 °C).
Line a cooling rack on top of a baking sheet.
Work on the donuts one at a time. Use your fingers to pinch the two ends, and gently stretch it into a thin long strip that is about 8” (20 cm) long. Then gently lower it into the oil. You can cook 2 to 3 donuts at a time, depending on the size of your pot.
Cook each side for 2 minutes or so, until it turns golden color for a soft crispy texture, or a golden brown color for a crispier texture.
Use a pair of tongs to remove the donuts from the oil, gently shake off the excess oil, then transfer them onto the cooling rack.
Enjoy the donuts while they’re hot or warm.
Store
To store the leftover donuts, wait until they cool down completely, then transfer them into a ziplock bag. Store them in the fridge for 2 to 3 days or in the freezer for up to a month.
To reheat the donuts, preheat the oven to 400 °F (200 °C). Place the donuts on a baking tray and bake until heated through, 5 minutes for refrigerated or 8 minutes for frozen donuts.",en-US,5.0,,Omnivore's Cookbook,205,12 serving(s),1 donut,103 kcal,12.9 g,2 g,4.7 g,0.9 g,,244 mg,0.1 g,0.5 g,,

Combine the minced ginger and hot water in a small bowl. Stir to mix well and set aside.
Prepare the dough
In a large tall plate or a big bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, cornstarch, instant yeast and sugar. Stir to mix well.
Slowly pour in the warm water, a few tablespoons at a time, and mix with a pair of chopsticks (or a fork). Once all the water has been added, keep mixing and scrape off the dry flour on the side of the bowl, until it forms many small dough flakes.
Pour in the vegetable oil. Keep mixing with the chopsticks until the oil is absorbed.
Start kneading by hand while further incorporating the dry flour, until there’s no dry flour left in the bowl.
Transfer the dough onto a working surface. Knead for 15 to 20 minutes, until the dough is quite smooth and elastic and there’s no dry flour left in the bowl. It’s OK if there’s some unevenness in the dough, which will smooth out after resting. The dough should be quite tough and not sticky to the touch. Cover and seal the bowl with plastic wrap. Let rest until it doubles in size, 1 hour or so.
Prepare the filling
Add the ginger water, light and dark soy sauce, Shaoxing wine, salt, sugar, and white pepper to the ground pork in a large bowl. Beat with a pair of chopsticks or a wooden spatula in a circular motion, until all the liquid is absorbed and the meat is sticky. This process might take a few minutes. (*Footnote 4)
Add the green onions and sesame oil. Mix until they are incorporated. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Store in the fridge until ready to use.
Assemble the buns
When the dough has rested, transfer to a work surface and punch it down. Knead for 1 minute to deflate the air out completely, then form it back into a ball.
Cut the dough in half. Wrap half of the dough in plastic wrap and store in the fridge while working on the other half.
Poke a hole in the center of the dough you’re working with. Stretch the dough into a large oval by running your fingers along the inside of the hole in a circular motion. Once the diameter of the dough is about 1” (2.5 cm), tear apart the ring so it creates a long, thin strip.
Cut the dough strip into 12 even pieces by cutting it in half, then further cut each half into 6 pieces. Gently use a circular motion to round up each dough piece then flatten it with your palm. Cover them with plastic wrap to prevent drying out.
Work on one piece of dough at a time - take one dough piece and place in front of you. Roll it with a rolling pin in one hand, using the other hand to rotate the dough while rolling, until the diameter reaches 5” (13 cm). You should keep the edges thinner than the center, so the wrapper of the bun will be even once you make the pleats.
Place the rolled dough in your palm and add 1 tablespoon of filling in the center.
Start wrapping the bun by folding and pinching the edge over itself, in one direction, until it is almost sealed. Then rotate and pinch the top of the pleats to fully seal the bun. (View my video for more details)
Repeat with the remaining dough pieces to wrap all the buns. Keep the wrapped buns under a piece of plastic wrap to prevent drying out. Once done wrapping, let rest for 10 minutes. Once rested, you should cook the buns immediately. You can store the wrapped buns in a sealed container in the fridge for up to 1 hour before cooking.
Repeat the wrapping steps to wrap the other half of the dough.
To cook the buns:
Add 2 tablespoons of oil and carefully place 12 wrapped buns into a 9” or 10” skillet. Heat over medium-high heat until hot. Turn to medium heat. Cook, uncovered, for 3 minutes, until the bottoms are lightly browned.
Pour about 1/4 cup hot water into the pan, just enough to cover the buns halfway up. Cover the pan and cook over medium heat for about 8 minutes, until the water is completely evaporated.
Turn the heat to medium-low and cook for another 2 to 3 minutes. Turn the heat off and remove the pan from the stove. Let the buns rest with the lid on for an additional 2 minutes. Remove the lid and transfer to a plate. Repeat the steps to cook the rest of the buns.

Add flour to a large bowl and slowly blend in water. Use a pair of chopsticks to whisk the flour until the water is fully absorbed. Dust both hands with dry flour and start kneading, until dough forms.
Dust a working surface with flour and transfer the dough onto it. Knead the dough until the surface turns smooth, about 10 minutes.
Transfer the dough to a large bowl. Cover with a damp dish towel or plastic wrap. Allow to rest at room temperature for 30 to 40 minutes.
To make pie filling
While resting the dough, prepare the filling.
Cube lamb meat into 0.8 to 1 centimeter (0.3 to 0.4 inch) pieces and add them into a large bowl.
Add ginger, soy sauce, cumin powder, salt, and peppercorn powder. Mix well. Add peanut oil and mix again. Add cornstarch in 2 batches and mix by hand until the lamb is evenly coated.
Add onion and mix well.

Preheat oven to 220 degree C (430 F). Line a baking tray with aluminum foil. Spray (or brush) a thin layer of oil.
Add 2 tablespoons of oil to a small bowl and set aside.
Dust the working surface with flour again and transfer the dough onto it. Divide the dough into two equal pieces and put one piece back into the bowl. Cover well.
Dust both hands with flour and knead the dough several times. Roll the dough into a long stick and further divide into 5 equal parts.
Knead a piece of dough a few times to shape a ball. Press it into a round disc. Roll the dough with a rolling pin to flatten the disc to about 18 centimeters (7 inches) across and 2 millimeters (1/12 inch, like the thickness of a 1 dollar coin) thick.
Place 4 to 5 tablespoons of filling in the center of the dough disc. Brush a thin layer of oil onto the edge. Fold the upper and lower edges of the dough until they overlap each other. Fold the left and right ends so the dough seals the filling inside. Press gently and place onto the baking sheet.
Work on the rest of the dough in the same manner.
Spray (brush) each meat pie with a thin layer of oil on top and sprinkle sesame seeds to garnish.
Bake on the middle rack and bake at 220 degree C (430 F) for about 15 minutes, until the surface turns golden brown.
Let the meat pies cool for 5 minutes, then transfer a plate.
Serve warm as a snack or main dish.
To make pie filling
Follow the way above of cooking traditional meat pie. You could replace the cubed lamb leg meat with ground lamb. It’s easier to wrap with ground lamb.
To wrap the rolls
Place a sheet of egg roll wrapper on a cutting board (or working surface). If you are using a 15x15 cm sheet, use 2 layers at a time. Place 2 to 3 tablespoons of filling on the lower end of the sheet. Fold the sheet like folding a spring roll: fold the bottom first; then fold both sides to seal the filling; roll and tuck the filling; place it seam side down. (see footnote)

Gently rinse with tap water and drain. Remove the tough stems and mince the mushrooms. It yields about 1/4 cup of loosely packed minced mushrooms.
Add the dried wood ear mushrooms to a medium sized bowl and add at least 1 cup of hot water to cover. Rehydrate until the mushrooms turn completely soft, 30 minutes or so. Gently rinse with tap water and drain. Remove the tough ends, if any, and mince the mushrooms if they are big, or thinly shred them if small. It should yield about 1/2 cup of loosely packed minced mushrooms.
Cook the dried rice vermicelli until tender according to the package instructions. Drain and and measure 1 cup of cooked vermicelli. Coarsely chop them to about 1/2-inch (1 cm) length pieces.
Add 2 tablespoons peanut oil into a large nonstick pan and heat over medium heat until hot. Add the garlic and ginger. Stir a few times to release the fragrance.
Add the rehydrated and chopped shiitake mushrooms, wood ear mushrooms, and carrots. Stir and cook for 2 minutes. Add the cabbage, 1 tablespoon soy sauce, Shaoxing wine, and curry powder. Cook and stir for another 2 minutes, until the cabbage turns tender and all the liquid has evaporated. Transfer everything to a big plate to cool.
Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil into the same pan. Add the tofu. Stir and cook the tofu for 1 minute. Further break up the tofu into smaller chunks with your spatula while cooking. Add the cooked vermicelli, the remaining 2 tablespoons soy sauce and the maple syrup. Cook and stir until all the liquid has evaporated, 2 minutes or so. Transfer everything into a big mixing bowl and let cool for a few minutes.
Once the tofu and the cabbage mixtures have cooled to a warm temperature, add the cabbage mixture into the same mixing bowl with the tofu. Add the green onion. Stir to mix well.
Wrap dumplings
Prepare your working station by placing the dumpling filling, wrappers, and a large tray on your table. Fill a small bowl with water and set it aside.
Scoop about 1 tablespoon of dumpling filling and place it in the center of the wrapper. Dip your finger into the bowl of water and use it to wet the edge of the wrapper. Hold the dumpling with one hand and start sealing the edges with the other hand. After folding, press the edges again to seal well. You can use any method to fold the dumplings as long as you’re comfortable with it.
(Note, If you’re wrapping dumplings using homemade wrappers, you can add more filling, as much as you can handle, when you fold the dumplings. You also won’t need the water to wet the wrapper edge if you’re using homemade wrappers.)
Storage
Now you can freeze these dumplings if you don’t cook them immediately. Place them onto a baking tray and seal them in with a plastic wrap. You can store the dumplings in the freezer for up to 1 month. Once the dumplings are completely frozen, after about a day, you can transfer them to a gallon zipper bag to save freezer space.
Cook the dumplings
Cook the dumplings in batches.
Option 1 - Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a nonstick skillet over medium heat until hot. Add dumplings in a single layer. Cook until the bottom side turns golden. Add 2 tablespoons water and cover. Cook until the dumplings are cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes.
Option 2 - To get a crispier result, heat 2 to 3 tablespoons oil in a nonstick skillet over medium heat until hot. Add the dumplings in a single layer. Cook until the bottom side turns golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip the dumplings, add 2 tablespoons water, and cover. Cook for another 1 to 2 minutes, until the bottom turns golden brown.
Immediately transfer the dumplings to a plate. Cook the rest of the dumplings according to the same method.
You can serve the dumplings immediately with dumpling dipping sauce or a simple drizzle of Chinkiang vinegar.
Reheating
The best way I’ve found to heat up cooked dumplings, by far, is to use an air fryer. It crisps up the dumplings well without using any more oil. Alternatively, you can reheat the dumplings on the stovetop, using a nonstick pan with a thin layer of oil, covered.
Cooking frozen dumplings
The method is almost the same as cooking freshly made dumplings. But you will need to cook them covered for 2 to 3 minutes longer. I also add a bit more water, about 1/4 cup, to make sure it generates enough steam to heat the filling through.",en-US,5.0,,Omnivore's Cookbook,60,50 serving(s),1 dumpling,44 kcal,6.8 g,1.4 g,1.4 g,0.2 g,,82 mg,0.6 g,0.5 g,,

Cook
Turn your Instant Pot to the “Saute” function and add oil. Wait until the indicator shows “HOT”.
Add the meatballs into the Instant Pot. Leave a small amount of space between each of them. Let them cook without moving, until the bottom side is browned. Flip to brown the other side. It will take a total of about 5 minutes. You may need to do two rounds of browning. In that case, take the browned meatballs out of the Instant Pot, allow the pot to get hot again, and add the next round.
Once all the meatballs are browned, turn off the saute function and put any meatballs you may have taken out of the pot back in. Stir the sauce to dissolve the cornstarch completely and pour it over the meatballs.

Combine ground lamb meat, Shaoxing wine, light soy sauce, and dark soy sauce in a large bowl. Mix well until the mixture becomes a sticky paste. Add ginger. Sprinkle evenly with Sichuan peppercorn powder and salt (if you’re using it). Mix thoroughly. Add peanut oil and mix well. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside (or in the fridge if you’re not planning to make dumplings within an hour).
(option) If you are making your own dumpling wrappers, mix the ground lamb with the seasonings first, and set aside at room temperature for up to 1 hour (or in the fridge for up to a day). Do not add any vegetables to the meat at this point, because the veggies will be dehydrated by the salt, and the filling will become watery.
Right before you wrap the dumplings, prepare the vegetables. To mince the carrot and zucchini, you can use a mandoline to slice them into strips first, then chop them into small bits. You can also use a food processor to mince them.
Cook carrot. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a wok (or a nonstick skillet) over medium high heat until warm. Add carrot, stir, and saute until cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a plate.
When you’re ready to start wrapping dumplings, add green onion, zucchini, and carrot into the ground lamb. Mix well.
To wrap dumplings
{If you are using fresh homemade wrappers} Scoop about 1 tablespoon (or slightly less) of the dumpling filling and place it in the center of the wrapper. Hold the dumpling with one hand and start sealing the edges with the other hand (refer to the video or this post to see detailed information on how to fold a dumpling).
{If you are using pre-made wrappers from the store} Scoop about 2 teaspoons (or 1 tablespoon, depending on the size of the wrapper) of the lamb filling and place it in the center of the wrapper. Gently press the mixture into a round shape, so it will be easier to wrap. Wet your finger or a pair of chopsticks with water and gently brush water onto the edge of the wrapper. Fold the wrapper into a half moon shape. (*see footnote 2)
If you have trouble sealing the dumplings, reduce the amount of filling until you can seal it easily.
Place the dumplings on the working surface, one finger’s width apart. Work with the rest of the wrappers in the same manner.
You should wrap the dumplings in small batches, 20 to 25 at a time. After the dumplings are wrapped, cook or freeze them within 30 minutes. Otherwise, the dumplings will start to lose moisture. For more information on cooking frozen dumplings, refer to this post.
To boil dumplings
Bring a large pot of water to a boil.
Carefully add dumplings into the water, one at a time. Use a big ladle to stir the water gently and continuously, until the water starts to boil again, so the dumplings won’t stick to the bottom, for about 1 minute. Adjust the heat so the water is at boiling point, but isn’t bubbling too fiercely.
When the dumplings float to the surface, continue boiling until the dumplings are filled with air and swollen, and the dough starts to become transparent, about 1 minutes. Immediately transfer all the dumplings to a plate.
Be careful, the dumplings cook quickly and you should always stand beside the pot throughout the boiling process. When the dumplings are cooked, they will start to fall apart within seconds, so transfer them as soon as possible.
To cook potstickers
Heat a tablespoon of oil in a nonstick skillet over medium high heat. When oil is hot, place potstickers in the skillet, pleat side up.
Swirl 2 tablespoons water in the skillet, cover immediately, and turn the heat to medium. Cook covered until the water is evaporated and potstickers are cooked through, about 3 minutes.
Remove the cover and flip one potsticker to see whether the bottom side is charred. If not, turn to medium high heat and cook until the bottom side turns golden brown.
Transfer the potstickers to a plate.
To serve dumplings
Option 1: Serve with Chinese black vinegar and a few ginger slices.
Option 2: Serve with Chinese black vinegar and a few drops fresh Chili oil.
To freeze dumplings
If you plan to store dumplings or won't serve them immediately, always freeze them uncooked. It won’t affect the texture or flavor of the dumplings.

To wrap potstickers
Prepare a small bowl of water. Place a piece of parchment paper on a working surface or dust a wooden board with flour.
To wrap a potsticker, scoop about 2 teaspoons of the pork mixture and place in the center of the dumpling wrapper. Gently press the mixture into a round shape, so it will be easier to wrap. Wet your finger or a pair of chopsticks with water and gently brush water onto the edge of the wrapper (this will help the wrapper stick to itself when pressed together).
Fold the wrapper into a half moon shape, using fingers to pinch the middle and press the two layers together. Use your left hand to hold the dumpling and your right hand to fold 2 to 3 pleats in the outer layer towards the midpoint, and press it well to seal the filling inside.
Switch so that you're holding the dumpling in your right hand, and use your left hand to form more pleats in the same manner. Press the pleats again to seal the filling tightly. If you have trouble sealing the dumplings, reduce the amount of filling inside until you can seal it easily.
Place potsticker on the parchment paper. Continue forming the rest of the potstickers in the same manner. Leave about a finger’s width between any two dumplings, so they won’t stick together.
To mix dipping sauce
In a small bowl, drizzle vinegar over ginger slices. If the dipping sauce is not salty enough to your liking, you can add soy sauce to adjust the flavor, 1 teaspoon at a time.

(Optional) Press the tofu gently using your hands or a few layers of paper towel to get rid of excess water. Use this step if you’re short on time and need to use less time to marinate the tofu. You can skip this step if you’re going to marinate the tofu overnight.
Prepare a container that’s slightly bigger than the block of tofu. Combine all the sauce ingredients in the container. Stir to mix well. Transfer 2 to 3 tablespoons of the marinade into a separate small bowl to use as a dipping sauce later.
Cut the tofu in half lengthwise, then into half-inch-thick squares. Transfer the pieces into the container by making them “stand”, so it helps the marinade to disperse evenly (see the blog post above to see how to arrange the tofu). Use your hand to gently separate the tofu slices, so all the surfaces will be in touch with the marinade. If the marinade cannot cover all the tofu, use some green onion (or white onion) to fill up the empty space in the container, so the marinade covers most of the tofu.
Cover to seal the container. Gently shake it. Marinate overnight in the fridge or at room temperature for at least 4 hours.
Cook
When you’re ready to cook, remove the tofu from the marinade and lay it on a few layers of paper towels to drain the extra liquid.
Combine the coating ingredients in a plate. Stir to mix well.
Prepare a big plate with a few layers of paper towels, for the cooked tofu.
Heat a thin layer of oil in a nonstick (or carbon steel) pan over medium-high heat until hot.
You might need to cook the tofu in batches depending on your pan size. While heating up the pan, coat each piece of tofu with the coating mixture and place it on a plate. You should only coat the pieces you’re going to fry immediately.
Carefully add the coated tofu pieces into the pan. Cook without moving until the bottom is browned, 2 minutes or so. Flip to cook the other side until browned, another 2 minutes. Turn the heat down to medium if the pan gets too hot and the oil starts to smoke. Repeat the process until you’ve fried all the tofu pieces.
Transfer the fried tofu onto the paper towel lined plate to drain the excess oil.

Add water to cover rice with 1 centimeter (0.5 inch) excess. Let the rice soak at room temperature for 4 to 5 hours or in the fridge overnight (cover / wrap the bowl if placed in the fridge).
Drain the rice. Add white sugar and mix well.
Wash lotus root carefully. Peel the rind off and discard it. When you cut off the tough ends, be careful not to cut off so much that you reveal the tubes.
Cut about 2 centimeters (1 inch) from one end of the lotus root. Save the small piece that you cut off to use as a lid.
To stuff the lotus root with glutinous rice, add a spoonful of rice onto the cut end and use a chopstick to push the rice into the holes. Use a chopstick to squeeze the stuffed rice and compress it. Carefully fill up all the tubes, including the small ones. (It will take some time. I highly suggest you sit down and play your favorite TV show while doing this.)
Place the small “lid” back to cover the cut end, in exactly the position it originally was (so the glutinous rice will expand into the holes of the “lid” during cooking). Use 6 to 8 toothpicks to seal the “lid”. You should push the toothpicks as far in as you can. The glutinous rice will expand during cooking and the “lid” will fall off or be pushed apart if not sealed carefully.
Add lotus root to a small pot, with 2 cups of water to cover (*see footnote 2). Add rock sugar (or white granular sugar) and brown sugar. Bring to a boil over high heat. Stir during boiling to dissolve the sugar.
Turn to low heat, cover, and boil for 1 hour. Keep the water boiling throughout. Flip the lotus root after 30 minutes and add more water to cover it, if necessary.
Turn to lowest heat to simmer for another 20 minutes. Flip the lotus root 4 to 5 times during cooking.
To serve after cooking, transfer the lotus root to a cutting board and allow it to cool. Cut into evenly thick slices when the root is cool enough to handle.
To serve later, leave the lotus root in the pot until it cools off completely before slicing. If you plan to serve it the next day, place the lotus root in an airtight container and add the sugary water to cover. Store in fridge.

Add baby spinach and 1 cup water into a blender (I used my Vitamix). Turn on blender and gradually increase to the highest speed. Blend until the spinach is completely broken down. Transfer to a bowl.
Once you finish this step, jump to the noodle-making process to make the dough.
Carrot dye
Bring a small pot of water to a boil. Blanch carrots until tender, 5 to 8 minutes. Drain and rinse with cold water to cool. When the carrots have cooled enough to handle, transfer them to the blender with 1 cup water. Turn on blender and gradually increase to the highest speed. Blend until it forms a smooth paste. Transfer to a bowl.

Beet dye
Bring a small pot of water to a boil. Blanch beets until tender, about 5 minutes. Drain and rinse with cold water to cool. When the beets have cooled enough to handle, transfer them to the blender with 1 cup water. Turn on blender and gradually increase to the highest speed. Blend until it forms a smooth paste. Transfer to a bowl.
Once you finish this step, jump to the noodle-making process to make the dough.
Purple dye
Add red cabbage and 1 cup water into the blender. Turn on blender and gradually increase to the highest speed. Blend until the cabbage is completely broken down. Transfer to a bowl.
Noodle dough
Add the flour and salt into a high-powered blender or food processor with 2/3 cup of dye liquid.
Pulse until it starts to form a dough ball and lift off the blades, about 30 seconds. Add more dye liquid if the dough does not come together, 1 tablespoon at a time. Add a little more flour if the dough looks too moist. Pulse for another 20 to 30 seconds. Dust a thin layer of flour onto your working surface. Transfer the dough onto it and knead for 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer the dough to a bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let rest for 30 minutes.
Clean your blender (or food processor) before proceeding to the next color.
Noodles
Once you've made all the doughs, start making the noodles. At this stage you can cover the doughs with plastic wrap and store them in the fridge for a day, or freeze them for a month. Thaw completely before making noodles.
Divide each dough into four even pieces, shaping the four pieces into dough balls. Work on one piece at a time, returning the remaining doughs to the bowl and covering them.
Run the dough through a pasta rolling machine, starting on the widest setting and slowly working your way down to the desired thickness. My pasta machine has 10 settings. I usually use 6 for super thin noodles or 4 for more chewy noodles. Use the fettuccine attachment to cut the pasta into wide noodles or the spaghetti attachment for thinner noodles. Dust the noodles with extra flour to prevent sticking. Hang the noodles on a drying rack or a floured surface while working on the rest of the dough. If you do not have a pasta machine check out my Fresh Homemade Noodles recipe for instructions on how to roll and cut your noodles by hand (https://omnivorescookbook.com/fresh-homemade-noodles).
Cook and serve
Heat chicken or vegetable broth in a pot until boiling. You should prepare 6 to 8 cups of broth for each color.
Bring a large pot of water to a boil over medium-high heat. Only cook the portion of noodles you're about to serve.
Add noodles, one color (or 3 to 4 servings) at a time, and immediately stir with chopsticks (or tongs) to separate the noodles. Boil until the noodles are cooked through, about 1 minute for thin noodles or up to 3 minutes for thicker noodles.
Use tongs to transfer the noodles to a strainer. Flush with tap water to cool. Drain and transfer to serving bowls.
Add the broth to each noodle bowl, add 1 to 2 teaspoons soy sauce. Garnish with a few drops of sesame oil (or homemade chili oil), chopped green onion, and sesame seeds, if using.
Serve immediately.
Store
Dust the bottom of an airtight container with flour. Generously sprinkle flour onto the noodles. Fold the noodles into the container and cover. Store in the freezer for up to 1 month.
To cook frozen noodles, cook them like you would cook fresh noodles, without thawing. You'll need more cooking time, about 4 to 6 minutes depending on the thickness of the noodles.",en-US,-1.0,,Omnivore's Cookbook,55,4 serving(s),1 serving,163 kcal,28.6 g,7.8 g,1.4 g,0.3 g,,876 mg,0.8 g,1.2 g,,

In a large bowl combine the all-purpose flour, salt, and sugar. Stir with a fork to mix well.
Microwave the water to approximately 180 degrees F (80 C). It should be too hot to touch but not boiling.
Slowly add the hot water into the flour mixture, stirring with a fork to mix the water into the flour.
Once all the water is added, work the water into the flour until it forms large doughy flakes without any dry flour left. Feel the flakes with your hand. It should be quite firm and not too soft. If there’s still a lot of dry flour left, add 1 more tablespoon of water.
Add the oil. Mix and knead with your hand until it forms a dough ball.
Transfer the dough ball onto a clean working surface. Knead by hand for 5 to 8 minutes, until the dough becomes firm. It is OK if the surface is not smooth.
Return the dough to the bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let rest for 30 minutes.
Filling
Prepare the filling while the dough rests. Combine the eggs, Shaoxing wine, and salt in a medium-sized bowl. Whisk until evenly mixed.
Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a medium-sized pan over medium heat until hot.
(Optional) Add the dry shrimp. Cook and stir until it turns golden brown, 1 minute or less.
Add the egg mixture. Stir with a spatula to scramble the eggs and cut them into smaller pieces. Cook until the eggs just begin to firm up. Transfer to a plate to cool.
Add the chives into a large bowl. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon of peanut oil. Mix with a spatula until the chives are evenly coated with a thin layer of oil.
Once the eggs are cooled, add them into the bowl with the chives. Add the oyster sauce and sesame oil. If you aren’t using the papery dried shrimp, add 1/2 teaspoon salt into the mixture.
Assemble
Once the dough has rested, the surface should become smoother and the texture softened. Divide the dough into two even pieces using a knife of dough cutter. Work on the dough one piece at a time. Place one piece back into the bowl and cover with plastic wrap.
Roll the dough on the working surface until it forms a ball. Cut the dough in half. Roll each piece into a long log, then divide it into 3 even pieces.
Add a small spoon of oil onto your working surface and use your hand to grease the surface. It prevents the dough from sticking to the surface.
Work on the dough one piece at a time. Roll the dough with both of your hands until it forms a ball.
Press the dough with your hand, then roll it out into a 6” (15 cm) disk.
Use a measuring cup to scoop 1/4 cup of egg-chive filling, press it down with your hand, and add more filling so it fills the cup tightly (very important). Add the filling onto the center of the rough disk. Fold the dough over it to create a half moon. Gently use your hand to press the filling to even it out.
Seal the edges of the dough together by gently pressing the dough and pressing out as much of the air bubbles as you can.
Crimp the edges by folding the excess dough together along the edge using your hand, one finger width at a time, until it forms a pattern. Cut off any extra dough at the end and discard it. If you don’t know how to crimp the edges, you can simply press the dough together so it won’t break apart during cooking.
Cook
Heat 1 to 2 tablespoons of oil in a large nonstick frying pan over medium heat until hot. Pan fry the Chinese chive pockets until the bottom turns golden brown, 2 minutes or so. Turn to the other side and fry until golden brown. If the pan starts to smoke, turn to medium-low heat. If your chive pockets are thick, you can also stand them upright in the pan to fry the edge.
Once done, transfer the chive pockets to a big plate. Serve hot with Chinkiang vinegar (highly recommended) or dumpling sauce. You can add soy sauce to the vinegar if you think the pockets are not salty enough.
Storage and reheating
To store the chive pockets, place in a ziplock bag, using parchment paper to separate the pockets. Squeeze out as much air as possible, and seal the bag. Freeze them for up to 2 months. To reheat frozen pockets, you don’t need to thaw them. Cook them in the pan just like if you were making fresh ones, except that you’ll need to cover the pan and add a splash of water while heating.

Debone the chicken legs (see the step-by-step guide above in the blog post), setting the bones aside for the stock. Using the back of the knife to pound the thick part of the meat so that it is an even thickness.
Sprinkle the toasted salt and Sichuan peppercorns over the chicken legs. Top with the Shaoxing wine, green onion, and ginger. Use your hand to gently massage the seasonings in and set aside for 15 minutes.

Heat over medium-high heat until bringing to a boil, then reduce to medium-low heat. Simmer for 30 minutes, skimming the foam from the top occasionally. Transfer the stock to a heat proof container once done.
Add the goji berries, salt, sugar, and Shaoxing wine. Stir until the sugar and salt are fully dissolved. Place the stock in the fridge to cool down completely.
Steam the chicken
After the chicken has marinated, roll each leg into a tight log, skin side out.
Place the rolled chicken leg on a piece of aluminum foil. Wrap the leg with the foil to seal it completely.
Set up a steamer by adding water to the pot and bringing to a boil over medium-high heat.
Place the chicken rolls on the steaming rack and steam over medium-high heat for 15 to 20 minutes, depending on the size of the chicken legs.

Add the oil to a large skillet (nonstick or carbon steel), just enough to coat the bottom of the pan. Heat over medium-high heat until hot. Add the chicken one piece at a time using a pair of chopsticks or tongs. Turn to medium heat if the pan starts to smoke too much.
Cook the chicken until the bottom turns golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip to brown the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. (Alternatively, you can deep-fry the chicken with more oil at 350 F (176 C) until golden brown.) Transfer chicken to a large plate and remove the pan from the stove to let it cool a bit.
Your pan should still have a thin layer of oil remaining in it. If not, add 1 to 2 tablespoons of oil. Heat over medium heat. Spread the basil leaves. Cook the bottom side for 30 seconds. Flip to cook the other side until crispy. Transfer the basil leaves to a large plate to cool.
While the chicken is still hot, sprinkle about half of the spice mix over the chicken and gently toss it with a pair of tongs. Taste the chicken. Add more spice mix if needed. Add the cooked basil leaves and toss again.
Serve as an appetizer.
You can store the leftover chicken in a sealed container in the fridge. To reheat the chicken, preheat your oven to 350 degrees F (176 C).

OPTION 1 - USING YOUR HANDS: Combine the flour and salt in a big bowl. Stir to mix well. Slowly drizzle in the hot water while mixing it with a pair of chopsticks (or a fork), until the water is fully absorbed. Slowly drizzle in the cool water, continuing to stir until many dough flakes form. Press the dough together, and try to combine the wet dough with the dry flour. Drizzle in a little extra water if there is any dry flour remaining. Knead until a firm ball is formed, about 5 minutes. Cover and let rest for 20 minutes.
OPTION 2 - USING A MIXER: Combine the flour and salt in the mixer bowl with the dough hook attachment. Turn it to the mix setting and slowly drizzle in the hot water followed by the cool water. After a minute of mixing, drizzling in a little extra water if there is any dry flour remaining. Turn to setting 4 and knead until a ball of dough is formed, about 3 minutes. Cover and let rest for 20 minutes.
Make the filling
While the dough is resting, combine the flour, oil, and salt in a small bowl. Mix until a smooth paste is formed.
If making the dipping sauce, combine all the ingredients with 1 tablespoon of water in a small bowl and mix until the sugar is dissolved.
Form the scallion pancakes
When the dough is done resting, knead for another minute until it is smooth. Cut the dough into 6 even pieces, about 76 grams per piece. Form the dough into balls using your hands.
Work on one dough ball at a time, covering the rest with plastic wrap to prevent drying out. Roll each dough ball into a thin rectangle with a rolling pin, aiming for around 6x10” (15x25 cm). Lift and turn the dough regularly as you roll it to prevent sticking. Spoon about 1 tablespoon of the filling onto the dough and spread it evenly with the back of a spoon, leaving about 1” (2.5 cm) on top and the left end without the filling. Sprinkle 2 heaping tablespoons of green onions onto the paste, concentrating most of it towards one side of the length and one side of the width, creating a loose L shape (see the blog post above for the step-by-step pictures).
Begin rolling the dough from the longer side of the dough where the green onions are concentrated, until you have one long tube. Lightly flatten the tube using your hand. Pinch the side with more green onion to seal it. Take the sealed side and gently pull and roll it towards the unsealed side, using your hand to smooth out the dough to push any large air bubbles out. Tuck the loose end under the rolled bun. Gently press down on the round disk with your hand to seal the pancake.
Set the formed pancake aside and cover it with plastic wrap. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until each pancake is ready.
Roll out the pancake
Roll each prepared pancake into a circle, about 7-8” (17-20 cm) wide. Flip and move it as you do to prevent sticking. Don’t worry if air bubbles burst through or some green onions fall out.
If you plan to store the pancakes and cook them later, place each pancake onto a piece of parchment paper and stack them. Transfer the pancakes to a large ziplock bag, squeeze out as much air as possible, and seal the bag. You can freeze the pancakes for up to 3 months.
Cook the pancakes
Heat a 9” (23 cm) cast iron pan (or a nonstick skillet) over medium-high heat and add enough oil to fully coat the bottom. Once the oil is hot, add a pancake. Use a pair of chopsticks (or a spatula) to swirl the pancake around to spread the oil and prevent sticking, for a few seconds. Cover the pan and turn the heat down to medium. Let the pancake cook, covered, for 1 minute. Remove the lid and flip the pancake, cover, and cook for another minute. Remove the lid. Use a spatula to press the pancake, to ensure even browning. Continue to cook, flipping regularly, until both sides are crisp and browned, about 3 minutes. Turn to medium-low heat if the pan gets too hot. Transfer the pancake to a cooling rack or a cutting board to cool. Repeat to cook all the pancakes you plan to serve.
Once the pancakes are slightly cooled enough to handle, cut into 6 pieces and transfer to a serving platter. Serve hot with the dipping sauce as an appetizer.
Cook frozen pancakes
Let the frozen pancakes thaw for 10 minutes then proceed from step 8.

Prepare the shrimp by boiling a small pot of water with a large pinch of salt. Add the shrimp and cook for about 1 minute, until they turn pink and are fully curled. Once cool, slice the shrimp in half lengthwise and set aside.
If using the ground meat, heat the oil in a medium-sized pan until hot. Add the pork. Break it apart to keep the ground chunks small. Stir occasionally as you cook the pork until browned. Sprinkle with salt and add the wine. Keep cooking until all the liquid evaporates and the meat is cooked and chopped into small pieces. Transfer the meat to a plate to cool. (*Footnote 4)
Prepare the rest of the ingredients while the proteins are cooling off.
If you do not plan to serve the spring rolls the same day, you can now seal all the prepped ingredients in airtight containers and store them in the fridge for up to 2 days.
Make the sauce
To make the sesame sauce, combine everything in a medium-sized bowl and stir until it forms a smooth paste. If the paste is too thick, add a few drops of water at a time and mix until your desired consistency is reached.
To make the Nuoc Cham sauce, combine all the ingredients in a small bowl with 4 teaspoons of water. Depending on the strength of your fish sauce, you may want to add extra water or sugar according to your taste.
The sauce can be made ahead and stored in the fridge for up to 2 days.
Assemble
The day you plan to serve the spring rolls, place all the filling ingredients on plates for easy access. Fill a shallow but wide dish with an inch of warm water. (*Footnote 5) You should have a clean working surface like a cutting board that you can spread the rice paper on.
Work on the rolls one at a time. Take a rice paper wrapper and pull it through the water slowly 3 or 4 times (rotate the paper if your plate is not enough to fit the whole sheet of paper). You want it to be moist but still a bit stiff, as it will absorb more water as you place your filling on it and will be fully hydrated by the time you roll it up. Lay the moistened wrapper on a flat work surface.
To build the roll, work in thirds. Be sure to leave an inch and a half of space on the bottom and top of the wrapper. Also leave 2 inches of wrapper on the edges. (See the step-by-step photos in the blog post above for the folding steps.)
On the first third of the wrapper lay a piece of lettuce, then place 1 to 2 tablespoons of cooked ground meat in the center. Fold it so the meat is wrapped in the middle, then place it folded side down.
In the middle of the wrapper, lay a few slices of avocado, evenly spaced and at an angle. On top of the avocado, add a layer of carrots and a few herb leaves without the stems.
On the top third, place three of the halved shrimp, pink side down and evenly spaced.
Take the bottom edge of your wrapper and fold it over the third with the lettuce. Then roll the bottom third over the center. Take both sides and tightly fold them in. Tuck a sprig of the herbs at the edge of the roll, allowing them to poke out of one side. Then continue to roll over the shrimp and press lightly to seal on the remaining loose rice paper.
Set the formed spring rolls aside on a plate. Repeat the wrapping with all of the remaining rice wrappers. Make sure to space out the spring rolls, because the rice paper will stick together if the rolls are placed against each other.
Serve the spring rolls at room temperature with the dipping sauces. Enjoy!
Storage
You should always serve the spring rolls the same day you wrap them. If you plan to prepare them in advance, you should prep all the ingredients and wrap the spring rolls when you’re ready to serve. The ingredients will last in the fridge for 1 to 2 days. The wrapped spring rolls will last at room temperature for a couple of hours (half a day).

Combine all the marinade ingredients in a large bowl and mix well. Add the chicken wings and toss with your hands (or a pair of tongs), until the chicken is evenly coated. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Marinate for at least an hour at room temperature, or overnight in the fridge.
(Optional) Before cooking, take the top off of your marinating container and place it in the fridge, uncovered, for an hour. This will help dry out the outer layer of this skin to encourage crisping when baked.
Bake
Preheat the oven to 250°F (120°C).
Combine the dry rub ingredients in a large bowl and mix well.
Pat dry the marinated chicken with kitchen paper towels, and remove the large pieces of chili pepper from the Doubanjiang. Place the chicken wings in the dry rub bowl and toss to coat evenly.
Line a baking tray with foil and place a wire rack on top. Spray the rack with oil and spread the wings evenly across it.
Bake at 250°F for 30 minutes.
Turn the oven up to 450°F and bake for an additional 15 minutes.
After 15 minutes, flip the wings to allow the bottom to crisp up, 5 to 10 minutes.
Hot sauce
While baking the chicken, heat the oil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add the doubanjiang and ginger and saute until fragrant, around 30 seconds.
Add the vinegar and Shaoxing wine. Cook until some moisture is evaporated, about a minute.
Remove the sauce from the heat and pour it into a tall glass. Add the honey. Mix with an immersion blender until it forms a smooth sauce. Depending on the thickness of your Doubanjiang, you might need to add 1 to 2 tablespoons of water to the sauce to get the desired texture.
Serve

Thaw the dumpling wrappers overnight in the fridge or 30 minutes at room temperature.
Make the base
Combine the squash, butter, chicken broth, leftover gravy (or turkey dripping) if using, black pepper, nutmeg, and cardamon in a medium size bowl. Smash everything together and mix well with a spatula.
Cook spinach
Heat the oil in a medium-sized skillet over medium heat until hot. Add the garlic. Cook and stir to release the fragrance, 30 seconds or so.
Add the spinach. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the spinach is cooked through and all the liquid evaporates. Let cool for a few minutes.
Transfer the cooked spinach to a cutting board. Finely chop it into small bits.
Assemble
Add the cut spinach, turkey, and salt into the bowl with the mashed squash. Stir to mix well. Taste the mixture. It should taste slightly salty. Add more salt if needed. The texture should be similar to or slightly thicker than mashed potatoes - you should be able to shape it but it shouldn’t be too dry. Add a bit more broth if and mix it again if the mixture is too dry.
To set up your dumpling station, prepare a small bowl of water, the thawed wrappers, the bowl of dumpling filling, and a tray for the completed dumplings. Also, to prevent the wrappers and dumplings from drying out, wet a few layers of paper towel (or cheesecloth), and squeeze out the excess water. Loosely cover the wrappers and assembled dumplings.
Wrap the dumplings one by one. Wet the edge of a dumpling wrapper using your finger. Place 1 to 1 1/2 tablespoons of filling onto the center of the dumpling wrapper. Shape it into an oval shape. Pinch together the wrapper at one of the tapered ends of the filling. Fold the rest of the wrapper towards the pinched end, one side at a time, so it forms pleats (see the pictures in the blog post above or watch this video). Once the dumpling is sealed, use your fingers to press the pleats so it seals tightly. Set it aside and work on the rest of the dumplings.
Cook
Add 2 to 3 tablespoons of oil to a nonstick pan (or use a carbon steel or cast iron pan with more oil). Heat over medium heat until hot. Add the dumplings. You might need to cook the dumplings in batches depending on the size of your pan.
Pour in 1/4 cup water and cover the pan immediately. Let steam for 3 minutes, or until the dumpling wrapper turns semi transparent. Uncover the pan and check the bottom of the dumplings. If the bottom hasn’t browned, let cook for another minute or so, until the bottom turns golden brown. Transfer the dumplings to a plate.
Serve
Serve the dumplings as a snack, appetizer, or main dish with leftover cranberry sauce or cranberry relish.
Store
You can store the uncooked dumplings in an airtight container in the fridge for one day or in the freezer for up to a month. To cook the frozen dumplings, use the same method given in the recipe, but cook them covered for a longer time (6 minutes or so). For the cooked dumplings, you can store them in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days.

Choose a shallow dish large enough to hold the pork belly (I used a baking dish). Add all the marinating ingredients and stir to mix well.
Pat the skin of the pork belly with a paper towel to dry completely. Score the skin into a crosshatch pattern using a sharp knife. Try to cut through the skin without piercing the fat.
Carefully transfer the pork into the shallow dish with the marinade. The marinade should come up to the sides of the pork but not touch the skin. Let it marinate in the fridge uncovered overnight or for up to a day.
Cook
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil for easy cleaning. Place a wire rack on top and then place the pork on the rack.
Evenly spread a layer of salt to cover the pork skin entirely.
Cook at 400 F (200 C) for 30 minutes. Then lower the oven temperature to 300 F (150 C). Bake for another 2 hours.
Raise the oven temperature to 450 F (230 C) and roast for another 30 to 45 minutes, until the skin completely crisps up.
Move the pork onto the kitchen counter and loosely cover with aluminum foil. Slash a cross on top of the foil to let out steam so the crackling will remain crispy. Rest for 10 to 15 minutes before serving. Alternatively, you can place the pork in the oven on the lowest setting if you won’t serve it immediately.
Serve the pork hot or warm with preferred dipping sauce (*Footnote 4).
Store and reheat
Store the leftover pork in fridge for 3 to 4 days.
To reheat, preheat the oven to 400 F (200C). Separate the skin from the meat. Place the skin in a baking dish without overlapping, in the middle or upper section of the oven.

Combine the dry rub ingredients in a small bowl and mix well. Sprinkle evenly over the back of the ribs and rub in. Flip the ribs and sprinkle on the top side, rub in the spice again. Set aside to marinate briefly while preheating the oven to 275°F (135°C).
Combine the sauce ingredients in a medium-sized bowl. Mix well.
Once the oven is heated, brush a thin layer of sauce all over the ribs.
Place another piece of foil over the top. Crimp the bottom foil over the top foil and fold a few times to create a sealed parcel.
Place the ribs in the oven and bake for 2 to 3 hours depending on their size (*Footnote 2). Once done, you can use a thermometer or a fork to poke through the foil to test the doneness. The meat should feel very tender or read at least 160°F/71°C.

Return the ribs to the oven and bake until beginning to char, 10 to 15 minutes. Check on the ribs every 5 minutes to prevent them from burning.

Soak the bamboo leaves, sweet rice, and mung beans separately in water overnight.
Combine all the pork ingredients and allow to marinate overnight.
The day of making the zongzi
(Optional- to sanitize the bamboo leaves, remove them from the soaking liquid and add them to a pot with fresh water. Bring it to a boil and cook the leaves for 5 minutes.) Drain the leaves and wipe them each down on both sides. Cut off an inch from the base and an inch from the tip.
Place the shiitake mushrooms in a medium-sized bowl and add hot water to cover. Soak for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the mushrooms are soft throughout. Drain the mushrooms, squeeze out the excess water, and slice them into quarters.
Drain the rice and transfer it to a big bowl. Add the seasonings to the rice and mix until evenly coated.
Drain the mung beans and transfer them to a medium-sized bowl.
To wrap the zongzi (see the process photos above for the steps)
Take two leaves, making sure they do not have any holes or tears. Use a pair of kitchen scissors to cut off 1” (2.5 cm) from both ends. Face the smooth sides towards yourself (this is the side that will contain the filling), with the wider base sides facing away from each other, then overlap the leaves to make 1 long strip. There should be 3-4” (8-10 cm) of individual leaf sticking out beyond the overlap on each side. A third of the way along the strip, pinch the side opposite from you and fold it into a cone shape, with the leaf sticking out from one end. Hold the cone using one hand and begin to add the filling with your other hand.
Add 2-3 tablespoons of rice to the bottom and press it up against the sides to create a small well. Add a piece of pork (make sure every piece added has a chunk of fat), half a yolk, two quarters a shiitake, and 1 to 2 tablespoons of mung beans. Add 2 to 3 tablespoons of rice over everything. Gently press and smooth as you do. There should be a 1/4” (1/2 cm) lip around the rice.
Take the open side of the zongzi between your thumb and index finger and fold the sides inwards, covering the rice. Fold the long leaves over the open area, tightening between your thumb and index finger to create a pointed triangular shape. Then flip the zongzi over and wrap the leaves around tightly to seal it. Wrap the zongzi in a piece of twine, making sure it is cinching any area where the leaf might come loose, and tie it off. For extra security, you can use another piece of twine to wrap the zongzi again, crosswise.
Cook the zongzi
Cook on the stovetop: Bring a large pot of water to boil and add the zongzi. Return the pot to a low simmer and cook covered for 3 hours (4 if the zongzi are very large).
Cook in an Instant Pot: Add the zongzi to an Instant Pot and water to cover. Close the lid and make sure the valve is sealed. Choose “Manual” at “High Pressure” and set a timer for 1 hour. Once done, let the Instant Pot release the pressure naturally.
Drain the zongzi from the water and serve hot.
Store and reheat
Store cooked and wrapped zongzi in an airtight container or Ziplock bag in the fridge for 5 days or in the freezer for up to 6 months. To reheat, thaw the zongzi completely in the fridge overnight. Boil the zongzi in water until heated through, 15 to 20 minutes. You can heat up the unwrapped zongzi in a microwave as well.",en-US,5.0,,Omnivore's Cookbook,960,12 serving(s),1 zongzi,314 kcal,49.6 g,14.1 g,5.7 g,2.1 g,124 mg,470 mg,2.8 g,3.3 g,,

Rinse the shiitake mushrooms and dried shrimp separately with tap water and gently rub them to remove any dirt. Place each ingredient into a different bowl. Add hot water to cover. Soak for 15 minutes, or until the ingredients turn soft. Drain and dice into small pieces.
Peel the daikon radish and grate it into thin strips.
Cook
Add the Chinese sausage into a large nonstick skillet and heat it over medium heat. Cook until the sausage is lightly browned and some oil is rendered off, 5 minutes or so.
Add the shiitake mushrooms and dried shrimp. Cook and stir for 1 minute. Add the green onions. Stir a few times to release the fragrance. Transfer everything to a plate.
Add the daikon radish and 1 cup of water. Cover and cook over medium heat until translucent and soft but not browned, 12 minutes or so. Once done, taste the daikon to make sure it's fully cooked through and turned very soft. Transfer the cooked radish into a big bowl using a pair of tongs. Squeeze out as much juice as you can, back into the pan. Once done, transfer all the juice from the pan to a measuring cup. Then add more water until it reaches 1 cup (no need to add extra water if you end up with a full cup). Rest the liquid until it's slightly cooled, 10 to 15 minutes.
Add rice flour and the cooled daikon cooking liquid into the bowl with the cooked radish. Add the sugar, salt, and white pepper. Stir to mix well. It will form a very runny batter.
Pour the batter back into the pan you used to cook the radish. Cook over medium-low heat and stir constantly, until the mixture has thickened just enough to draw a line on the bottom of the pan, 1 to 2 minutes.
Assemble & steam
Prepare 1 to 2 glass tupperware or baking dishes that can fit into your steamer. I used two 4.5” x 4.5” (11cm x 11 cm) glass containers to cook two batches. If you have a large wok or steamer, you might be able to fit an 8” x 8” (20cm x 20cm) baking pan in it. You’ll only need to cook one batch in this case. If you’ll be cooking in two batches, cover the uncooked batter with plastic wrap to prevent it from drying out.
Grease the glass tupperware with oil, so the turnip cake will come off easily later. Transfer the mixture into the tupperware, about 1.5” (4 cm) thick
Set up your steamer by adding water to the pan and bringing it to a boil. Add the steaming rack with the turnip cake container. Cook, covered, over medium-high heat, for 1 hour, until the turnip cake is cooked through. You can test the doneness by inserting a knife into the cake and it should come out clean. If your batter is slightly thicker or thinner, you might need to adjust the cooking time by adding or subtracting 10 minutes.
Once done, remove the container from the steamer and set it aside to cool. Once the container is no longer hot, transfer it to the fridge. Let the turnip cake set until it has cooled completely. I highly recommend resting it overnight before serving. I’ve tried resting it 2 hours, and the turnip cake was a bit too soft and difficult to slice.
To remove the fully chilled turnip cake, use a knife to loosen the edges from the container, then turn the container upside down. The turnip cake should come out in one piece.
Reheat & Serve
To serve, cut the turnip cakes into 1/4” (1 cm) thick pieces. Brown both sides in a heated skillet coated with a thin layer of oil until heated through and the surface turns golden.
To store, transfer the steamed turnip cakes (without pan-frying) into an airtight container and store them in the fridge for 2 to 3 days, or in the freezer for up to 1 month.

Combine the fish, curry paste, egg whites, fish sauce, and sugar in a food processor. Pulse a few times, to mix until it forms a smooth, thick, and sticky paste, 2 minutes or so. Once finished, poke the fish paste with a spoon. It should be firm, elastic, and springy. Transfer the fish paste into a big bowl.
Fold the green beans into the paste using a spatula.
Heat 1/2-inch oil in a small deep pot over medium heat until hot (*Footnote 4).
Work on the fish cakes in batches. Use a cookie scoop to transfer a ball of 2 tablespoons of fish paste onto an oiled spatula. Then use the back of another spatula or a large spoon to flatten the ball into a 1/4-inch (1/2-cm) thick disc. Gently slide the fish cake into the pan.

Add flour into a large bowl. Slowly pour the water into the bowl, mixing them together with a pair of chopsticks.
When the water is mixed with the flour, dust both hands with flour and start kneading to form dough. The dough will be quite tough and should easily be able to be lifted from the bowl without sticking to the bottom.
When dough has formed, dust the working surface with flour and dust hands again. Transfer the dough to the working surface and continue to knead it until its surface becomes smooth, about 10 minutes.
Rinse a clean dish towel with water. Dust the bottom of a large bowl with flour and transfer the dough into it. Cover bowl with the damp dish towel and a lid (or plastic wrap). Let the dough rest for 2 hours. You can let the dough rest longer, 4 to 5 hours.
After resting, the dough will be softened and have a smooth texture. Dust the working surface and your hands with extra flour and transfer the dough onto the surface. Knead the dough repeatedly for another 3 to 5 minutes, until the dough hardens again. Let the dough rest for about 30 minutes (or longer).
During this time, you can prepare the dumpling filling(s).
To make dumplings
Dust the working surface again and transfer the dough onto it. Slice 1/6 of the dough off and place the rest back to the big bowl. Cover it with the damp dish towel.
Roll the dough into a long stick, 2.5 to 3 centimeters (1 inch) in diameter. Use a knife to cut the dough stick into about 12 small doughs, each weighing 12 to 14 grams (0.4 to 0.5 oz) (*see footnote 2).
Slightly dust both sides of each small dough with flour. Work on them one at a time.
Dust the working surface again. Take one dough and press it to a round disc. Roll it with a rolling pin into a round sheet (refer to the video to see how). Try to roll it so that that the edge is thinner than the center. The wrapper should be about 1 millimeter thick (i.e. almost same as the thickness of a CD), and the diameter should be about 7 centimeters. It is ok if the wrapper is not perfectly round.
Starting here, you should work as quickly as you can, because the wrappers will dry out quickly. And if they do, you will find it very difficult to seal the dumplings later. If the wrappers dry out when you start to fold the dumplings, brush a bit of water over the edge so you can still seal the dough.
Scoop about 1 tablespoon (or less, so you can easily fold the dumpling) of dumpling filling and place it in the center of the wrapper. Hold the dumpling with one hand and start sealing the edges with the other hand (refer to the video to see how to fold a dumpling). Be careful, when you press the edges together to seal the dumpling, do not let filling touch the sealing area (the dumpling will fall apart if you do). After folding, press edge again to seal well. You don’t need to fold beautiful dumplings here; our goal is to make the dumplings hold their shape during boiling.
Place the dumplings on the working surface and work on the rest of the doughs in the same manner.
Try to wrap and cook dumplings in small batches (20 to 25 dumplings at a time). If you won't cook dumplings soon after wrapping (within 30 minutes), freeze them first (refer to the session ""to store dumpling"" below). If you want to know the reason, read the session of ""Things you should take note of"" above.
To cook boiled dumplings
Bring a large pot of water to a boil.
Carefully add dumplings one at a time into the water. Use a big ladle to stir the water gently and continuously, until the water starts to boil again, so the dumplings won’t stick to the bottom, for about 1 minute. Adjust the heat so the water is at boiling point, but isn’t bubbling too fiercely.
When the dumplings float to the surface, continue boiling until the dumplings are filled with air and swollen, and the dough starts to become transparent, about 1 minute (*see footnote 3). Immediately transfer all the dumplings to a plate.
(*) Be careful, the dumplings cook quickly and you should always stand beside the pot throughout the boiling process. When the dumplings are cooked, they will start to fall apart within seconds, so transfer them as soon as possible.
To cook potstickers
Heat a tablespoon of oil in a nonstick skillet over medium high heat. When oil is hot, place potstickers in the skillet, pleat side up.
Swirl 2 tablespoons water in the skillet, cover immediately, and turn the heat to medium. Cook covered until the water is evaporated and potstickers are cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes.
Remove the cover and flip one potsticker to see whether the bottom side is charred. If not, turn to medium high heat and cook until the bottom side turns golden brown.
Transfer the potstickers to a plate.
To serve dumplings
Option 1: Serve with Chinese black vinegar and a few ginger slices.
Option 2: Serve with 1 tablespoon Chinese black vinegar + 1 teaspoon light soy sauce + 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil.
Option 3: Serve with Chinese black vinegar and a few drops fresh Chili oil.
To freeze raw dumplings
If you plan to store dumplings or won't serve them immediately, always freeze them uncooked. It won’t affect the texture or flavor of the dumplings.
Dust the bottom of a big airtight box with a thin layer of flour. Place the dumplings, one finger’s width apart. Store in the freezer for up to 2 months.
To cook frozen dumplings
Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add dumplings into the water. Use a big ladle to stir a few times. Cover and cook until the water starts to boil again. Adjust the heat so the water will keep boiling without spilling. Cover and cook for 3 minutes (up to 5 minutes for bigger dumplings). Uncover pot. Continue to cook for about 1 minute (up to 2 minutes for bigger dumplings), until cooked through. Transfer to a plate immediately.
To store and reheat cooked dumplings
Store leftover boiled dumplings in airtight container in the fridge and consume as soon as possible, within 1 to 2 days.
To reheat in microwave - Add dumplings into a bowl and sprinkle with a few drops of water. Cover and heat until warm.
To reheat by steaming - Place dumplings in a bowl. Place a tall-rimmed plate upside down in a pot and add water to cover. Place the bowl of dumplings on top. Heat over high heat until water is boiling. Continue cooking for 5 minutes.

Wrap the egg rolls
To prepare the wrapping station: Add some water to a small bowl. Place the egg roll wrappers on a plate along with a spoon and the filling. Prepare a large plate or oven tray to hold the wrapped egg rolls and a cutting board for wrapping the egg rolls.
To wrap an egg roll, gently remove one egg roll sheet from the stack using both of your hands and place it on the cutting board, with a corner pointed toward you. Add 2 to 3 tablespoons of filling onto the lower end of the wrapper, making a 4-inch (10 cm) wide, tight and even mound. Tightly roll from the bottom corner toward the top, until about halfway up. Tightly fold the left and right corners of the wrapper towards the center, so it looks like an opened envelope. Dip your finger into the water and brush the top corner of the wrapper. Tightly roll the egg rolls upward until it’s completely sealed. Repeat the process, until you’ve used all the filling.
Although you can freeze the egg rolls at this stage, I personally prefer to cook them all and store the cooked ones so I only need to set up the deep frying equipment once. On the other hand, if you want to make the egg rolls in advance and serve them fresh at your party, you can freeze the egg rolls without cooking them. To do so, place the egg rolls on a baking sheet with gaps in between. Wrap them tightly with plastic wrap and store in the freezer until ready to cook. You can fry them directly from the freezer, with an additional 1 minute of fry time.
Cook the egg rolls
Prepare a baking sheet with a rack on top, for cooling the egg rolls.
Option 1 - To deep fry the egg rolls, heat 1-inch (2.5 cm) of oil in a deep medium pot or a dutch oven over medium heat to 350 F (177 C). If you do not have a thermometer, insert a wooden chopstick into the heated oil. You should see continuous tiny bubbles coming up around the chopstick. If the bubbles only come up here and there, the oil is not hot enough. If the bubbles are large and bursting to the surface, the oil is too hot.
Fry the egg rolls in batches of 5 to 6. Flip and move them occasionally for even browning. Fry until the egg rolls are golden, 5 to 6 minutes. Drain and transfer the egg rolls with a slotted spoon or wire spider onto the rack to let them cool. Repeat until you have cooked all the egg rolls.
Option 2 - To bake the egg rolls in the oven, preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 C). Place the egg rolls onto a lined baking sheet, seam-side-down, with about 2 fingers’ width gap between. Generously spray oil on top. Bake for 9 minutes, or until the bottom turns a golden color. Flip the spring rolls and spray oil onto them again. Return the tray to the oven. Bake for another 6 to 8 minutes, until the other side is golden as well. Once done, let the egg rolls cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes before serving to maximize crispiness.
Option 3 - To fry the egg rolls in an air-fryer, preheat the air-fryer to 390 F (10 mins or so). Cook them in batches. Spread a few spring rolls in the basket without overlapping them. Spray with a thin layer of oil, or you can bake them without using any oil. Bake for 6 minutes, flip, and bake for another 5 minutes. Once done, let the egg rolls cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes before serving to maximize crispiness.
Serve the egg rolls hot with whichever dipping sauce(s) you prefer.
Store and reheat
You can store the cooked egg rolls and reheat them later. If stored and reheated properly, the egg rolls will be just as crispy as freshly fried.
To store the egg rolls, spread them on a wire rack and let them cool completely. The egg rolls will be very hot inside once cooked, so it might take 1 to 2 hours for them to cool completely. Once cooled, you can store them in an airtight container or in a large ziplock bag. To get the best result, I prefer to spread the egg rolls in a single layer in a gallon ziplock bag and lay them flat in the fridge (or freezer). This way, the egg rolls won’t overlap and get soggy.
You can reheat the egg rolls in the oven or in an air fryer. Bake them at 350 F (180 C) until hot, or for about 10 minutes or so. The rolls will remain crispy.",en-US,5.0,,Omnivore's Cookbook,60,20 serving(s),20 g,101 kcal,9.4 g,8.3 g,4.1 g,0.7 g,23 mg,244 mg,1.2 g,0.6 g,,

Prepare the red oil sauce
Combine all the sauce ingredients in a medium-sized bowl. Stir to mix well.
Make the wontons
Add the minced pork into a medium-sized bowl. Add the aromatic water, egg, cornstarch, and white pepper powder. Mix until it forms a smooth and sticky paste.
Work on the wontons one at a time. Place about half a teaspoon of filling (or 1 teaspoon filling for bigger wontons) on the lower third of the wrapper. Fold the bottom side over the filling, then roll the filling all the way across to the other side of the wrapper. Brush a thin layer of egg white on one end of the wonton wrapper. Bind both ends and press them together to lock the filling inside the wrapper. Place on a big plate, a finger’s width apart.
When you’ve finished 10 to 15 wontons, cover them with a wet paper towel to prevent them from drying out.

Place the wood ear mushrooms in a small bowl and cover with hot water. Let rehydrate for 15 minutes, or until thoroughly tender. Drain, remove and discard any tough ends, and slice the mushrooms into thin strips.
Slice the chicken against the grain, first into thin slices then into thin strips.
Use your hands to gently coat the sliced chicken with the shaoxing wine, salt, and pepper. Then add the cornstarch and mix again until fully coated. Do the same with the sesame oil. This will help keep the chicken strips from sticking together. Marinate for 10 to 15 minutes.

Add the salt, tea, and peppercorns to a pan. Heat over medium-low heat, stirring regularly, until smoking.
Remove the pan from the heat and add the granulated garlic. Transfer everything into a spice grinder or a small food processor. Grind until everything turns into a granulated spice mix.
Combine the shaoxing wine and sesame oil in a small bowl. Stir well.
Transfer the chicken into a large bowl. Rub the chicken with the sesame oil mixture on the inside and outside until well coated.
Sprinkle the Sichuan peppercorn salt mixture onto the inside and outside of the chicken. Gently pat and rub with your hands until evenly coated.
Stuff the cavity with green onions and ginger. Seal with the garlic, with the cut side facing the inside of the chicken. Secure the stuffing by stitching together the cavity with a toothpick (skip this if you don’t have a toothpick). Tuck the wing tips underneath the breasts to prevent burning.
Place the chicken breast-side-down in the same large bowl. Cover with plastic wrap. Let it marinate overnight in the fridge. Rotate once halfway through marinating (it’s OK if you forget the rotating).
Roast the chicken
Adjust the oven rack, so the chicken will be positioned in the middle of the oven. Preheat the oven to 450 °F (232 °C). Line a roasting pan with foil for easy cleaning. Pour in a cup of water to prevent the drippings from burning. Place a roasting rack into the pan.
Option 1 - Fussless roasting
Drizzle the extra marinating liquid onto the chicken. Roast the chicken at 450 °F (232 °C) for 30 minutes.
Take the chicken out of the oven. Turn the oven to 350 °F (176 °C). Drizzle additional sesame oil onto the chicken. Add more water to the pan if needed.
Return the chicken back to the oven. Roast at 350 °F (176 °C) for another 30 minutes, or until the juices run clear.
Option 2 - Extra crispy thigh
If you happen to have an adjustable roasting rack, you can use this method to get extra crispy thighs. Start the roasting by shaping the roasting rack into a “V” shape. Grease the rack with a thin layer of oil to prevent sticking. Place the chicken on its side, so the thigh and the wing are facing up. Drizzle a few teaspoons of the marinating liquid onto the chicken. Roast at 450 °F (232 °C) for 15 to 20 minutes, until the top of the thigh turns golden brown.
Take the chicken out of the oven. Wearing a pair of oven mitts and holding both ends of the chicken, flip it so the other thigh and wing face up. Drizzle the rest of the marinating liquid onto the chicken. Continue to roast at 450 °F (232 °C) for 10 to 15 minutes, until the top of the thigh turns golden brown.
Take the chicken out of the oven. Turn the oven to 350 °F (176 °C). Drizzle additional sesame oil onto the chicken. Add more water to the pan if needed.
Return the chicken to the oven. Roast at 350 °F (176 °C) for another 30 minutes, or until the juices run clear.
Test doneness and rest
For a smaller chicken (under 4 lbs / 1.8 kg), I would test the chicken at the 20-minute mark, just in case, to avoid overcooking. For a bigger chicken, you might need 10 minutes or more of additional roasting time at 350 °F (176 °C) to finish.
For a more accurate reading, use an instant-read thermometer, inserted into the thickest part of the thigh and breast. The thigh should read at least 160 °F (71 °C) and the breast at least 155 °F (68 °C). While resting, the temperature of the dark meat will continue to go up and should reach 165 °F (74 °C), the safe temperature recommended by the FDA. Note, I prefer to cook chicken breast slightly under 165 °F (74 °C), which yields super juicy and tender results.
Let the chicken rest for at least 10 minutes before serving. It will stay pretty hot for about 30 minutes.
(Optional) Bonus - chicken rice
Collect the pan drippings in a measuring cup. Add water to the drippings to reach the needed amount of liquid, depending on the type of rice you’ll make. You will need 1 3/4 cup of liquid for jasmine rice, or 1 1/4 cup of rice for medium or long grain rice. Check out my rice cooking guide for more information.
Add the rice into a small saucepan. Add water to cover. Rinse in a circular motion with your fingers a few times. Drain the water and repeat the process one more time. Drain the water thoroughly.
Add the pan dripping water mixture, ginger, and a pinch of salt.
Cook over medium heat until the water comes to a full boil. Cover the pan and turn to low heat immediately. Steam 15 minutes for jasmine and long grain rice, and 18 minutes for medium grain rice. Do not uncover the pot during steaming.
Once the rice is done cooking, remove the pan from the stove. Let sit, covered, for another 10 minutes.
After resting the rice, use a fork or spatula to fluff it. Taste the rice. Add more salt and mix again, if needed.

Combine the sauce ingredients in a saucepan. Heat over medium heat until bringing to a boil. Boil for 5 to 10 minutes until slightly thickened. Set aside to cool.
Bake the ham
Preheat oven to 325 °F (162 °C). Set up a roasting pan with a wire rack. Pour 1 cup of pineapple juice into the bottom of the pan.
(OPTIONAL) If the ham has a thick layer of skin, remove it by running a knife across the leg, cutting through the skin without cutting the meat, and peeling off the skin with your hand. Then you can slice your ham in diagonal lines 1” (2.5 cm) apart, 1/2” (1 cm) deep, to create the crosshatch pattern.
Place your prepped ham on the rack. Brush it with the glaze. Bake it for 10 minutes per pound (0.45 kg) if the ham is fully cooked. It will take about 1 to 1.5 hours to cook the ham through. Or bake 25 minutes per pound (0.45 kg) for a partially cooked ham. It will take about 2-3 hrs to cook the ham through in this case.
Baste the ham every 20 minutes. If you’ve used up all the sauce, you can baste it with the juice from the pan. If the juice in the pan starts to get too thick, add some water to it to prevent burning.
Once the ham is baked (the internal temperature has reached 135 °F / 57 °C) and the glaze is caramelized, remove the pan from the oven.
On the bottom of the pan, the drippings should have formed a thick glaze. Spoon those drippings over top of the cooked ham until fully covered. Allow to rest for at least 10 minutes before carving and serving.
Store & Reheat
You can make the ham up to 4 days in advance and reheat it the day you serve it. If you plan to make the ham ahead of time, you should skip the final glaze and save the pan drippings in an airtight container.
To reheat the ham, cover it loosely with foil and reheat it in a 325 °F (162 °C) oven until it’s warm throughout, 5 minutes per pound (0.45 kg). It takes about 30 minutes to warm up a 6-lb (2.7 kg) ham and 50 minutes for a 10-lb (4.5 kg) ham. Note, you don’t want to heat up the ham too much, as it will cause the meat to dry out.
Heat up the glaze in a microwave. Brush the glaze over the ham once it’s warmed up.",en-US,5.0,,Omnivore's Cookbook,105,8 serving(s),1 serving,383 kcal,47.4 g,24.1 g,12.5 g,5 g,75 mg,1811 mg,25.4 g,2 g,,

Sprinkle 3 tablespoons of the mix over the chicken legs and rub it in so that the legs are evenly coated.
(Optional) Use your finger to separate the chicken skin from the thigh meat, making sure the edges stay attached. Rub some dry spices under the skin. This step helps the skin to crisp up even more and makes the meat more flavorful.
Let the rubbed legs rest, uncovered, in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to an hour, or 15 to 20 minutes at room temperature.
Combine the dry coating ingredients and the 1 remaining tablespoon of the spice mix in a big shallow plate. Stir to mix well. Add the buttermilk to another low, shallow dish.
Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Line a baking tray with foil for easy clean-up and place a baking rack on the tray. Generously spray the rack with cooking oil.
Once the legs are done marinating, prepare your coating station with the plate of chicken legs, the dish of buttermilk next to that, then the dry coat mixing (I also recommend having a spoon to scoop the dry mix over the chicken).
One at a time, hold the tip of the drumstick using one hand, dip the leg into the buttermilk, and flip to coat the other side. Let the excess buttermilk drip off, then place the leg into the dry mix. Scoop the dry mix over the leg and gently press it in, turning and repeating until the leg is coated. Gently shake off any excess coating and lay the leg on the rack, skin side up.
Add the legs to the oven and bake for about 45 minutes in total, until the chicken is crispy and lightly browned. After 10 minutes take the legs out and drizzle them with a small amount of oil and bake for another 20 minutes. Gently flip the chicken to crisp the bottom, for 10 minutes or so. For the last 5 minutes, flip the chicken right-side-up again to finish up. Once done, test the chicken by inserting a thermometer into the thickest part of the thigh and it should read at least 165°F (74°C). Or you can insert a sharp paring knife into the thigh and the juice should run clear. Bake for another few minutes if the chicken is not yet fully cooked.

Thoroughly rinse leg bones and transfer them to a 5-liter (5-quart) dutch oven (or big pot).
Cut the beef flank into strips that are around 8 centimeters (3 inches) wide and 12 centimeters (5 inches) long. Place them into the dutch oven.
Add 10 cups of water to cover the bones and beef. Bring to a boil over high heat. Turn to medium low heat and continue to boil for 10 minutes. Use a ladle to skim the foam from the surface and discard it, repeating until the broth comes clean.
Add cloves and Sichuan peppercorn into a tea infuser, and place the infuser in the dutch oven with the beef and bones. Add ginger, scallion, garlic, chili pepper, bay leaves, nutmeg, star anise, cinnamon stick and fennel seed to the pot, as well. Cover and simmer over low heat for 3 hours. Depending on the cut of beef you’re using, you may need to simmer longer, up to 4 hours.
While the broth is simmering, prepare the daikon radish. Peel the radish and cut it into 5-millimeter thick slices. Further divide each slice into 4 quarters. 30 minutes before the broth is done, add the daikon radish slices to it.
Check the broth every 30 minutes. During the first 2 hours, if the water is evaporating too quickly, add 1 to 2 cups boiling water to keep the beef and bones covered. You should not add any water during the final hour of simmering. The beef and radish should become very tender and the broth should turn a pale brownish yellow color. Add salt to season the broth. The broth should taste slightly salty by itself.
Use a ladle to transfer the beef to a plate to cool off. Use a strainer ladle to pick out the bones and spices and discard them. You might find a thick layer of oil floating on top of the soup (depending on the fattiness of the beef). Use a ladle to skim the oil off according to your preference (see footnote 3).
Boil hand pulled noodles. If you aren’t making hand pulled noodles, cook dried noodles according to instructions on the bag.
Prepare Chinese chili oil according to this recipe. You can use one from the supermarket, but I highly recommend you cook your own at home. It takes only 5 minutes, and freshly made chili oil is full of aroma and will make the dish shine.
Once the beef has cooled enough to handle, trim off any fat and discard it. Slice the lean part of the beef.
To assemble noodles
Add noodles to each serving bowl, then pour in the broth. Top noodles with beef slices, a few pieces of daikon radish, and some cilantro. Serve immediately with chili oil. Add 1/2 teaspoon to 2 teaspoons of chili oil according to personal taste.
To store leftovers

Rub both sides of salmon with cayenne pepper, black pepper and sea salt. Allow salmon to sit at room temperature for 10 to 15 minutes. Please note, the surface of salmon will get moist again after salting. You should gently pat the salmon with a paper towel again, to remove moisture before cooking.
Combine Greek yogurt and Dijon mustard in a small bowl. Mix well and set aside.
Boil noodles according to directions. Rinse the boiled noodles under tap water, drain and set aside.
Add the oil into a nonstick skillet and place on medium high heat. When oil is hot, add Sichuan peppercorn and stir a few times until fragrant. Turn to low heat, carefully scoop out peppercorns with a spoon, and discard them. Turn back to medium high heat. (If you don’t use peppercorn, heat oil until hot before adding salmon.)
Place salmon into skillet, skin side down. Immediately press the filet against the skillet with a fish turner. (If you don’t have a fish turner, use a spatula to press against the thinner part of the fish) Hold the spatula for 20 to 30 seconds, until the skin part is cooked. Once the skin side has turned dark brown and crispy, after about 2 minutes, flip the salmon to cook the other side. If the salmon filet is thick, like the one in the picture below, you should cook the cut sides too, about 30 seconds on each. Adjust heat to medium or medium low, if the temperature of the skillet gets too high.
Insert a thermometer to test the temperature of the salmon. When the temperature registers 50 degrees C (120F), immediately transfer the salmon to a plate. Continue to cook the rest of salmon in the same manner. Quite a lot of grease will come out of the salmon during cooking, so you won’t need to add extra oil to cook the following pieces.
Place noodles on a large plate, add salmon on top, top with avocado slices, mustard yogurt and green onion. Serve immediately with mentsuyu. Drizzle mentsuyu on the noodles before eating.

Flip the fish and season the other side in the same manner, spray with oil. Stuff ginger slices and a few slices of onion in the cavity of the fish.
Bake on the middle rack until fish is cooked through, about 20 minutes (or longer time if you use a larger fish). You should be able to easily separate the flesh from the bone with a fork, and the internal temperature of the fish should be 62 degrees C (145 F).
While the fish is baking, chop the rest of the vegetables. Place lotus root, bamboo shoots, and mushrooms on a plate.

Method 1 - Use an Instant Pot
Combine the rice, stock, chicken breast, Shaoxing wine, and ginger into your Instant Pot. Set it to cook at high pressure for 15 minutes. Once done, release the pressure naturally. Note, do not use fast release because the congee is starchy and might cause the valve to clog.

Add the century eggs, green onion, sesame oil (if using), and the shredded chicken to the pot. Stir to mix well. Taste the congee and add salt if needed.
Method 2 - Stovetop method
Combine the rice, stock, and 2 cups of water in a big pot.
Cook over medium-high heat until bringing to a simmer. Turn to low heat. Cover the pot and leave a finger-wide a gap between the lid and the edge of the pot, to allow more steam to escape and prevent the congee from spilling or boiling over. Simmer for 25 minutes.
Add the chicken breast. Cook for another 15 minutes. Remove the chicken breast and place it onto a plate.
If the congee has reached the desired texture when the chicken breast is done, turn off the heat. Transfer the chicken onto a plate and shred it with two forks. If you want a stickier and thicker congee, remove the chicken first, then keep cooking the congee for another 15 to 20 minutes. Note, the congee will get quite thick and sticky towards the end. Stay nearby the pot and stir frequently.

Add pork feet into pressure cooker and add water until the pork is covered completely. Cook over high heat until rated pressure has been reached. Turn to lowest heat and cook at rated pressure for 15 minutes. (*see footnote 3)
After releasing pressure naturally, transfer pork feet to a wok (or dutch oven). Transfer pork broth from pressure cooker to wok until it almost covers the pork. Add the rest of the ingredients into wok and turn to high heat. After bringing the broth to a boil, reduce to low heat and simmer covered for 30 minutes. Stir pork feet every 10 minutes to avoid burning on the bottom. Stir more often toward the end of braising, after the sauce has thickened. Add water during the braising process if the broth becomes thick while the pork is still tough. If the pork turns very soft but the sauce is still thin, turn to medium heat and boil uncovered. Reduce sauce until desired thickness.
To cook without a pressure cooker, skip step 2 and add boiled pork, water and all ingredients into a wok or a dutch oven. Add water until it covers pork and boil for around 2 hours. If the water level becomes too low while pork is still though, add warm water, 1 to 2 cups at a time, and continue braising.",en-US,4.96,,Omnivore's Cookbook,80,4 serving(s),,,,,,,,,,,,

Combine all the marinade ingredients in a bowl. Stir to mix well.
Remove the neck and giblets from the turkey cavity. Save them to make stock later or discard them.
Line a turkey bag over a large container *(Footnote 2). Place the turkey into the bag, neck side down.
Spread garlic and ginger in the turkey cavity, and stuff with white onions. Tie turkey legs together with twine, so the onions won’t fall out.
Pour the marinade on the inside and outside of the turkey. Carefully massage the bag to dispense the liquid evenly.
Try to squeeze as much air from from the bag as possible, and seal it with a clipper. Crumble and stuff old papers into the bottom of the container to lift the bag, so the marinade will rise higher and submerge 2/3 of the bird. Place the container into the fridge and let it marinate for 24 hours.
Once the breast side is marinated, transfer the container onto kitchen counter. Open the bag. Flip the turkey by lifting the legs with your one hand and use the other hand to hold the neck side. Squeeze the air from the bag and seal it. Rearrange the paper padding if necessary, to let the marinade submerge 1/3 of the bird. Place the container back into the fridge and let it marinate for 24 hours (or 12 hours if you’re in a hurry).
Prep for cooking
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 C).
Remove the turkey from the bag and place onto a big tray. Discard marinade liquid. Remove kitchen twine and discard the onions. Pat dry the turkey with a paper towel.
Remove the rind from the citrus. Cut into half if too large to fit into the turkey. I used lemon, orange, and grapefruit, but any other combination works too. Place the fruits into the turkey cavity.
Use toothpicks to seal the bottom of the turkey, so the fruits won’t fall out.
Use kitchen twine to tie turkey legs again. Pat dry turkey with paper towel again.
Prepare a roasting pan with rack inside. Brush a thin layer of olive oil thoroughly onto the top side (breast side). Move the turkey onto the roasting rack, breast side down. Brush a layer of olive oil onto the back side.
Cook
Place roasting pan at the bottom of the oven, or the position that allow the bird to sit right in the middle of the oven.
Bake at 400 F (200 C) for an hour.
Lower the oven temperature to 350 F (180 C). Cook for another 20 minutes to an hour for turkeys that are 14 pounds or larger (less time for smaller turkeys), or until the turkey back turns dark brown.
Remove from oven. Wear a pair oven mitts with several layers of paper towel on top, hold both ends of turkey and flip, so the breast side is up.
Insert a remote probe thermometer into the thickest part of the thigh, from the bottom of the turkey towards the breast in a horizontal position.
Return turkey to oven and set thermometer monitor alarm at 165 F (74 C) *(Footnote 3).
Once the turkey is done, remove it from the oven and use a instant thermometer to measure the other thigh and the thickest part of the breast. The breast should register 160 F (71 C).
Once the turkey is fully cooked, cover loosely with aluminum foil with a cross cut on top (*footnote 4). Rest for 30 minutes (up to 60 minutes).
Carve and serve.
How to make ahead and serve later
Let the turkey rest after cooking, then carve the turkey into legs, thighs, breasts, and wings. Do NOT slice the meat, as it results in dry turkey. Wrap the meat in aluminum foil, then seal in ziploc bags. Store in the fridge for up to 3 days or in the freezer for up to a month.
You should thaw the turkey in the fridge a day before serving, so it defrosts completely.
To reheat, preheat the oven to 300 F (150 C), or 350 F (180 C) for faster heat up. Unwrap the aluminum foil and place the turkey and the foil on a baking sheet, skin side up.

Slowly add olive oil and water into the bowl, 1/3 or 1/4 at a time, use a wooden spatula to stir clockwise, until flour and the liquid are roughly mixed, then repeat till all liquid was added. Add whole wheat flour into a small bowl and set aside. Coat both hands with whole wheat flour, use one hand to further kneel the dough and the other hand to slowly rotate the bowl, till all liquid is absorbed by flour and the dough is formed, in around 10 minutes.
Dust a big cutting board with whole wheat flour and coat hands again. Pick the dough from the bowl and place on cutting board. Scratch off the dough that sticky to the bowl by a rubber spatula. Use both hands to kneel the dough until the the surface becomes smooth and the dough is elastic, in around 8-10 minutes. You should be able to pick up the dough by hands, but feeling it a bit sticky to the board when pick up. If the dough is still too sticky, add more flour, 1 teaspoon at a time, and kneel till flour is well mixed with the dough. Cover the dough with plastic wrap or with a wet clear kitchen towel.
Add olive oil into a small bowl and set aside. Grease baking dish (or plate) with olive oil and set aside. Dust both hands with whole wheat flour again. Equally divide the dough into 6-8 pieces(*see footnote 1) by knife. Gently kneel each dough by both hands and dust the dough with a thin layer of whole wheat flour, place in the glass dish. After all dough balls are done, drip several drops of olive oil on each dough ball and gently grease the ball with hand. Cover the glass dish with plastic wrap and place in fridge for overnight.(*see footnote 2)
(Option) After storing the dough in fridge overnight, the dough will turn slightly bigger, as the image shows below. If you want to save the dough for later use. After storage in fridge overnight, take the dough out, mist it with a thin layer of olive oil again, and place into ziplock bag. Store in the freezer up to 3 months(*see footnote 3).
The day when you want to make pizza, take pizza dough out of fridge for at least 2 hours before baking. If take from freezer, take out the dough out earlier, or transfer the dough in to fridge at least a day earlier(*see footnote 3). Dust a cutting board and both hands with whole wheat flour. Gently take the dough out and dust it with whole wheat flour, place it on the cutting board. Gently press the dough into a flat round disk, about 1.5 centimeters (1 inch) thick. Cover it with a plastic wrap or a plate, to keep the dough from dry out. Let the dough rest in room temperature.
Preheat pizza stone on lower level of oven to the highest temperature 40 minutes before baking pizza (*see footnote 4), mine is 220 degrees C (430F). If you don't using pizza stone, assemble pizza on baking tray directly (*see footnote 5). Right before assembling pizza, dust both hands again (dust whole hands, including back sides) and dust a pizza peel (or oven tray) with flour (*see footnote 6). Pick out the pizza dough and slowly toss and rotate it with both hands to enlarge the dough. You can also use both hands to pick up one side of dough to let the gravity stretch it, then rotate, and stretch other sides. when the dough is getting thinner and become difficult to toss, place it on pizza peel (or baking tray). Stretch it gently to thinner till the thickness you like.

If you’re using bone-in chicken thighs, remove the bones using a knife. You don’t need to remove the bones if using the oven baking method.
Use the back of your knife (or a meat hammer) to pound the thicker part of the thigh, so the thigh will be cooked more evenly.
Marinate (Optional)
Skip this step if you’re using the oven method. Pour the Shaoxing wine into a big plate. Spread the chicken onto the plate, skin-side-up, so the meat side will be submerged in the wine. Sprinkle salt on the skin. Let marinate for 30 minutes to 1 hour at room temperature. Or cover with plastic wrap and marinate in the fridge up to overnight.
Teriyaki sauce
Mix the Shaoxing wine, soy sauce, brown sugar, and 1/4 cup water in a medium-sized bowl.
Heat 1 teaspoon oil in a small saucepan over medium heat until hot. Add the ginger, garlic, and the white part of the green onion. Stir a few times to release the fragrance.
Add the sauce. Make sure to scrape the bottom of your bowl to transfer all the sugar to the pan. Turn to medium-low heat. Cook, stirring occasionally until the sauce is reduced by half, 5 to 6 minutes.
Whisk the cornstarch with the remaining 2 tablespoons of water. Stir to dissolve the cornstarch completely. Pour into the saucepan and stir to thicken it, until it can coat the back of a spoon.
Once done, transfer everything to a small bowl.
Cook chicken
Thoroughly pat chicken dry with kitchen paper towels (very important).
If you skipped the marinating process, Lightly season both sides of the chicken with salt before cooking.
Option 1 - Cook in an air-fryer
Set your air-fryer temperature to 390 F (198 C) and preheat air-fryer for 6 minutes or so.
Lightly grease the meat side of the chicken with a thin layer of oil to prevent sticking. Spread the chicken into the air-fryer basket skin-side-up without overlapping. You probably need to cook the chicken in two batches. Cook until the skin turns golden brown, 10 minutes or so. Remove the chicken and slice the thickest part to check the doneness. If you’ve pounded the chicken thin, the chicken should have cooked through. If the inside is still pink, return the chicken to the air-fryer, skin-side-down, and continue to cook 2 to 4 minutes, until the inside turns completely white.
Option 2 - Cook in a frying pan
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large pan over medium-high heat until hot. Spread the chicken skin-side-down without overlapping. Gently use your spatula to press down on the chicken, so the skin will cook evenly. After 2 minutes, cover pan with a lid. Continue to cook another 2 minutes or so, until the skin turns golden brown. Turn the heat to medium or medium-low if the pan gets too hot.
Flip the chicken and cover again. Cook for another 3 to 4 minutes, until the bottom turns crispy and the chicken is cooked through.
Option 3 - Cook in the oven
Preheat oven to 220 C (425 F) on convect mode (if available). Add 1/4 cup Shaoxing wine to a 9” x 9” baking dish. Add chicken thighs to baking dish, skin-side-up. Arrange them to expose more skin and avoid overlapping. Bake until the skin is crispy and a thermometer inserted near the bone reads 165 F, about 30 minutes.
Assemble
(Optional) Transfer the chicken to a cutting board and cut into slices.

Make sure there is some space between the water level and the lip of the pot to avoid boiling over and to make skimming easier.
Add the green onions and ginger. Cook over high heat until the water reaches a full boil. Boil for 5 minutes, using a fine mesh strainer (or a ladle) to skim and discard the brown foam from the top, until the liquid is clear.
Strain the pork and reserve the blanching liquid. Rinse the pork with running tap water to stop the cooking and rinse away any scum that may have stuck to it.
In a separate medium-sized dutch oven or pot (make sure it is completely dry to avoid the oil and sugar splattering), add the sugar and oil. Heat over low heat until the sugar is melted and begins to brown; look for an amber color. Try to avoid stirring the sugar while melting it. Instead, swirl the whole pot.
Once the caramel is a light amber color, carefully add the pork chunks by gently placing them into the caramel to minimize splashing or splattering. Depending on the size of your pot, you might need to add the pork in two batches.
Turn the heat up to medium-low and brown the pork in the caramel, about 1 minute on each side. Be careful not to burn the sugar.
Add the cooking wine and scrape with a wooden spatula to release any brown bits from the bottom of the pan. Add the reserved blanching liquid, light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, ginger, green onions, and star anise.
Turn to medium-high heat until the broth comes to a boil. Turn to medium-low or low heat so the broth reduces to a simmer. Cover the pot, leaving a finger-width gap to allow the steam to escape. Simmer for 1 hour and 30 minutes. Stir 2 to 3 times during the simmering.
If the pork has turned tender but the sauce isn’t fully reduced, remove the lid and bring the heat up to medium. Cook for another 10 or 15 minutes, until the liquid is reduced to a glaze consistency. Keep an eye on the pot during the process and stir to prevent burning on the bottom.
Serve the pork with the glaze over steamed rice as a main course.
You can store the leftovers in a sealed container in the fridge for 4 to 5 days or in the freezer for a month.

Combine the water and salt in a small bowl. Stir to dissolve the salt.
Add the flour into a large bowl. Bit by bit, pour the water into the flour, mixing with a pair of chopsticks or a spatula as you go.
Once all the water is added, the dough should be in shaggy threads with little/no dry flour in the bowl. Begin pressing the dough together. If you find the dough is too dry and there’s still dry flour that’s hard to incorporate into the dough, drizzle more water onto the dry flour and mix it again, until there’s no dry flour left. Knead the dough until a rough, firm ball is formed, about 2 minutes.
Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it rest for 20 minutes.
Once the dough is rested, knead it again until it becomes smooth, 1 to 2 minutes.
Make the dough using KitchenAid
Mix the flour and salt in the bowl of the KitchenAid mixer and add the dough hook. Turn it to the mix setting. Slowly drizzle the water down the side, all along the bowl. This should take about 1 minute. Once the water is incorporated, turn to setting 2 and knead until a rough dough ball is formed, another 2-3 minutes.
Cover the dough with plastic wrap and let it rest for 20 minutes.
Either knead in the machine on setting 4 for 30 seconds or by hand for 1-2 minutes.
If you plan to store/freeze the dough, coat the dough with oil and store it in a sealed plastic bag. Refrigerate for up to 2 days or freeze for up to 3 months.
Shape the dough
FOR THIN NOODLES: Divide the dough to halves and roll each dough into a 1/2” (1 cm) thick oval.
FOR FLAT NOODLES: Divide the dough to halves and roll each and roll each dough into a 1/4” (1/2 cm) thick oval.
FOR WIDE NOODLES: Cut the dough into 8 pieces. Roll each piece into approximately 3”x5” (8x13 cm) ovals, 1/4” (1/2 cm) high.
Coat the dough(s) generously with oil and cover with plastic. Let rest for 2 hours.
Pull and cook the noodles
Bring a medium-sized pot of water to a boil.
FOR THIN NOODLES: Cut long the longer side of the oval, slicing the dough into 1/2” (1 cm) wide strips and rolling each piece slightly to the side with each cut to prevent them from sticking together. Cover the cut pieces with the plastic again to prevent them from drying out. Starting with the first strip you cut off, pick it up on both ends. (*Footnote 2) In one swift motion, tug the noodle about an arm’s length and gently bounce it on the working surface once or twice until it forms a long, thin noodle. Rest the noodle on your working surface as you fold it over, so that both ends are in one hand. Hook the other side with your thumb. Give it a couple light tugs and bounces until the noodles get longer and reach the desired thin shape. Then pull off the thick ends collected in one hand and lay the noodle out on the working surface. Repeat with the rest of your noodles.
FOR FLAT NOODLES: Cut along the longer side of the oval, slicing the dough into 1 1/2” (3 cm) wide strips. Cover the cut pieces with the plastic again to prevent from drying out. Starting with the first strip you cut off, pick it up on both ends. (*Footnote 2) In one swift motion, tug the noodle to about an arm’s length and gently bounce it on the working surface once or twice. Rest the noodle on your working surface for 10-20 seconds, then give it a couple extra-light tugs and bounces until it forms a flat long noodle. Then pull off the thick ends and lay the noodle out. Repeat with the rest of your noodles. Drop the noodles into the boiling water, a few at a time, and cook for 1 to 1.5 minutes.
FOR WIDE NOODLES: One at a time, grip the short ends of a strip (*Footnote 2) and pull it apart in one swift motion until the dough feels taut. It should be between 1 to 2 feet. Bounce it on the table a couple times. Pull off the thick ends and lay the noodle out, covering it with plastic to prevent drying out.
Cook the noodles
Drop the noodles, a few pieces at a time, into the boiling water and cook for 1 to 1.5 minutes, until tender but still with a chewy texture. Do not cook too many noodles at a time! It’s hard to control the texture that way and the noodles might stick together.
Storage
Store the cooked noodles: If you plan on reheating, you can slightly undercook the noodles (to al dente) to create a better texture once reheated. Store the noodles in an airtight container or a ziplock bag in the fridge for up to 3 days or in the freezer for up to 3 months.
For frozen/refrigerated dough; let the frozen dough thaw in the fridge overnight. Transfer the refrigerated dough to room temperature. Rest for 2 hours. The dough will become super soft and can be gently shaped, rested for another 10 minutes or so, and pulled. Cook according to the instructions above.
Reheating cooked noodles
To reheat, bring a pot of water to a boil and add the cooked noodles. Separate with a pair of chopsticks and cook until the noodles are just heated through.
For a quicker and lazier reheating method (for leftovers), reheat the refrigerated noodles in the microwave until heated, then quickly rinse the noodles with tap water in a colander. Drain the water thoroughly before serving.
If you plan to use the thin noodles for fried noodles, you don’t need to reheat them before using. Thaw them if frozen.

Preheat oven to 220 degrees C (425 degree F).
Prepare a roasting pan. Spread out the carrot, leek, white onion and garlic. Add chicken stock.
Combine all the ingredients for the hoisin butter sauce into a food processor. Puree until it becomes a fine paste. If you don’t have a food processor, finely chop garlic, green onion, shallot, and ginger. Mix everything together by using a mortar and pestle to form a paste.
Separate the skin from the turkey breast by gently sliding your finger between the meat and the skin. Try not to tear the skin. Leave the edges attached, so it shape a pocket to hold the butter. If you cannot stuff all the butter in, save the rest to use later (as chicken marinade or sauce).
Pour the paste in between the skin and the meat. Press your finger on top of the skin to distribute the paste evenly underneath. Sprinkle sea salt on both sides of the turkey breast.
Place the turkey breast onto the roasting pan with vegetables. Bake until the internal temperature reaches 60 degrees C (140 F), 50 minutes to 1 hour. The residue heat will keep cooking the turkey while resting.
Once the turkey is cooked through, remove it from the roasting pan and place onto a plate. Loosely cover with foil and let rest for 15 to 30 minutes.
Gravy
Strain the liquid from the roasting pan into a big measuring cup. Discard the solid ingredients. Skin off the fat with a ladle and discard, if needed. Reserve the juice. Add more stock, so you should have 2 cups of stock in total.

Once the pork chops are cooked, take the pork chops out of the sauce, scrape any sauce from the pork, and place them onto the lined baking tray. Broil each side until browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side.
While the pork chops broil, turn on the saute function on the Instant Pot. Let the black bean sauce cook for 3 to 4 minutes, until it becomes less watery. Note, the sauce will thicken once it has cooled a bit, so you don’t need to thicken it too much. Transfer the sauce to a small bowl.
Let the cooked pork chops rest for 10 minutes before serving.

Add the mushrooms into a medium-sized bowl and add 1/2 cup boiling water to cover. Make sure the mushrooms are submerged. Let rehydrate until the mushrooms turn soft, 15 to 20 minutes. Cut and prepare the other ingredients in the meantime. Once the mushrooms are done soaking, squeeze out the excess liquid and slice into strips. Reserve the soaking liquid.
Boil and cool the broth
Combine all the broth ingredients plus 3 tablespoons of mushroom soaking liquid in a small pot. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat and stir to dissolve the sugar. Remove the pot from the heat and set aside to cool completely.
Prepare the filling
Mix the filling sauce ingredients with 1 tablespoon of the mushroom soaking liquid in a small bowl. Stir to mix well.
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat until hot. Add the ginger and stir for 30 seconds, until it smells fragrant.
Add the rehydrated sliced shiitakes, carrots, and bamboo shoots. Cook and stir for another minute.
Pour in the sauce. Cook and stir until it is absorbed into the vegetables and the carrots are softened, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer everything to a big plate and set aside.
Assemble the loaf
Remove the tofu sheet from the package, remove 3 sheets from the stack, and keep them stacked and folded in half. Using a pair of kitchen shears, cut the uneven hard edges from the tofu sheets, and place the cut-off edges into the broth. Then slice the sheets in half so that you have 6 semi-circles.
Lay one semi-circle on a large clean work surface, so that the straight edge is facing left. Gather the cut edges from the broth with a pair of tongs. Use them to wipe a generous layer of broth onto the tofu sheet (it will be absorbed by the tofu), returning the edges to the broth when you are done. Lay another semi-circle over the first, this time with its straight edge facing right so that a rectangle-like shape is formed. Wipe the top layer of the tofu sheet with the broth in the same way you did with the previous layer. Repeat these steps, switching between laying the sheet right or left, until all the semi-circles are used. (See the blog post above for the step-by-step pictures.)
Squeeze most of the broth out of the edges and place them at the base (closest to you) of the rectangle, leaving 2” (5 cm) at the bottom and to both sides. Layer all the vegetable filling over the edges. When you’re doing this step, it’s important to make sure the length of the filling is shorter than the frying pan you will use later for the frying. (*Footnote 1)
Starting from the bottom, roll the sheets over the filling. Squeeze and tuck it tightly and continue to roll until the filling is fully covered. Then fold both sides inwards. Continue to roll so that they are tucked in. Once done, place the roll seam side down and you will have a loaf.
Cook the loaf
Prepare a steamer by adding water and bringing it to a boil. Place the loaf on the steaming rack. Steam covered for 8 minutes over high or medium-high heat. Once done, carefully remove the loaf from the steamer. Place it on a rack to let it drain.
Prepare a plate or a tray and top it with a wire rack.
Prepare a high-walled pan or pot that is large enough to fit the roll. Add enough oil so it would cover half of the loaf (but don’t put the loaf in yet). Heat over medium heat until it reaches 350°F (176°C). Gently lower the roll in with the seam side down. You can do this using a pair of tongs with the help of a spatula. Fry 2 to 3 minutes per side, until the roll turns golden brown all over. Carefully remove the loaf from the oil onto a rack to let drain briefly. Then transfer to a high-walled dish. Let rest for 5 minutes.

(Optional) If the bacon you use is too fatty, you might get a lot of rendered fat. Remove some of the fat by dipping a paper towel into the pan with a pair of tongs. I personally like to leave a bit of bacon fat in the pan, which will make the rice extra flavorful.
Add garlic. Stir a few times until fragrant.
Add olive vegetables. Cook and stir until you can hear a vibrant sizzling. It might only take a few seconds if the pan is properly heated. Olive vegetables contain oil, so your pan should be greased and ready for the rest of the cooking.

Add the dried shiitake mushrooms into a small bowl and pour in 1 cup of boiling water. Rehydrate for at least 20 minutes, or until the mushrooms turn tender throughout. Once rehydrated, remove the shiitakes from their soaking liquid, squeezing out the extra water. Slice them into 3/4”(1 cm) strips. Reserve the soaking liquid.
Cut the pork belly into thin slices, about 1/4”(1/2 cm) thick. Then cut into thin strips, about 1/4” (1/2 cm) thick. Transfer the pork belly into a medium-sized bowl. Add the Shaoxing wine and dark soy sauce. Mix well. Let marinate for 20 to 30 minutes.
Fry the shallots (Optional)
(Skip this step if using pre-fried shallots) While the pork is marinating, heat a 9” cast iron pan (or heavy-bottomed pan) over medium-low heat and add the 1/2 cup oil. Once the oil has reached around 200 to 250°F (93 to 120°C), add the shallots. Fry for around 5 minutes, then add the garlic. Fry for another 10 minutes, or until the shallots and garlic turn golden and crispy. (*Footnote 2) If some of the bits brown faster, fish them out using a slotted spoon, to prevent overcooking. Once done cooking, strain everything from the oil and set aside. Pour the oil from the pan into a heat-proof bowl, leaving a thin layer of oil in the pan. (You can save the aromatic oil to use in other recipes)
Braise the pork
Return the oiled pan to medium heat and add the marinated pork belly. Stir fry until the meat is lightly browned, about 5 minutes.
Pour in the shaoxing wine and scrape the pan with a spatula to release any brown bits. Add the soy sauce, dark soy sauce, sugar, star anise, cinnamon stick, crispy shallots, and shiitake mushrooms. Stir fry for 30 seconds, until everything is mixed together and well coated.
Add the cup of mushroom soaking liquid (being careful not to add the sediment at the bottom) and 1 cup of water.
Bring to a boil over medium-high heat then reduce to low heat. Simmer until the meat is tender and the liquid is reduced to a thin sauce, about 1 hour 30 minutes. Depending on your stove, the braising time might vary a lot. Check on the pork at the 1-hour mark, and stop cooking if the pork has turned tender and the sauce thickened.
Once the meat is set to a simmer, boil 4 eggs by bringing a pot of water to a boil, then adding the eggs to cook for 10 minutes. Run the cooked eggs under cold water to stop the cooking. Peel the eggs and add them to the braising pork during the last 30 minutes of braising.

Let it sit while you prepare the other ingredients so the black beans will soften, 5 minutes or so. Once the fermented black beans turn soft, smash them with the back of a spoon to thicken the paste. It’s fine if you cannot smash the beans evenly and completely. Once done, add the rest of the sauce ingredients and mix well.
Line a large dutch oven or heavy-duty pot with parchment paper and make sure you have about 8” (20cof paper poking out of the pot, so you can wrap up the ingredients later.
Spread the onion onto the bottom of the lined dutch oven. Place the fish on top of the onion, skin-side-down. Arrange the asparagus between the salmon fillets. Pour the black bean sauce over the salmon. Drizzle the olive oil and sprinkle the green onion over the salmon and asparagus.
Fold the paper over to cover the fish and crimp the edges loosely together so it forms a pocket to hold all the ingredients. Add 1/2 cup water outside of the parchment paper, and make sure the water doesn’t enter the paper pocket and dilute the sauce.
Cover the dutch oven with the lid. Cook over medium-high heat until the water boils, 5 minutes or so. Do not uncover the lid during the process. You should hear the water bubble when it starts to boil. Reduce the heat to medium or medium-low. Continue to cook for another 6-10 minutes depending on the thickness of the fish and the doneness you’re looking for. After 6 minutes, uncover the pot and unfold the parchment paper using a pair of tongs (be careful of the hot steam coming out of the pot). Test the doneness of the salmon by inserting a fork into the thickest part of the fillet. It should flake easily and the color should be pale pink throughout. If the salmon is mostly cooked but still has spots of darker pink, cover the pot again, remove it from the stove, and let sit for 3 to 4 minutes. If the salmon doesn’t flake easily, return it to cook on the stove for longer until it’s done.
Once the salmon is cooked, remove the pot from the stove immediately and uncover the pot. Let the steam out for a minute, remove the lid, and carefully open the paper.

Lightly dust the inside of the chicken with 1/2 tsp of five spice powder.
In a large ziploc bag, combine the marinade ingredients and mix well. Add the chicken. Massage a few times so the chicken is evenly coated with the marinade. Marinate for a minimum of 4 hours, up to overnight. (Preferably overnight)
Prior cooking
Remove the chicken from the fridge 30 minutes prior to cooking. Transfer the chicken from the ziploc bag to a big plate. Remove the ginger from the marinade and add it to the cavity of the chicken. Reserve the marinade for cooking the basting sauce.
Basting sauce
Transfer the leftover marinade into a small pot. Cook it on the stove stop over medium-low heat for 5-10 minutes.
Add the maple syrup (or honey) at the end and remove the pot from the stove. Set aside for basting the chicken at the end of baking.
Roast chicken
Preheat oven to 350F (177C).
Set up a baking tray with an adjustable roasting rack (highly recommended, or a regular grilling rack) and set the chicken on it. If you don’t have a rack, you can crumple up foil balls and set the chicken on them. Or alternatively, you can cut onions into big pieces and set the chicken on top
If you are using a probe digital thermometer, insert it into the thickest part of the chicken, usually into the thigh without touching the bone. (Not between the leg and the thigh, but the thigh itself)
After 20 minutes, you should see oil drippings. Baste the chicken with the oil every 20 minutes or so, for an hour. If you don’t get any oil drippings, you can use 1-2 tablespoon of oil.
For the last 30 minutes, start basting it every 10-15 minutes with the basting sauce. Note, make sure to close the oven door every time you’re basting the chicken, to prevent the oven temperature from dropping too much. The total baking time can range from 1 hour and 20 minutes (for a small chicken under 3 lbs / 1.4 kg) up to 2 hours (for a big chicken that’s 5 lbs / 2.3 kg).

Using a meat tenderizer or the back of a heavy knife, beat the pork chops until they are 1/4” (1/2 cm) thick. (Optional: cut 4 or 5 slits along the edge of the pork chops. This will help prevent the pork chops from curling while cooking). Spread the pork chops into a large ziplock bag (gallon bags work the best) with as little overlapping as possible. Or you can use appropriately sized tupperware containers.
Mix the marinade ingredients in a small bowl and stir to combine. If you do not use a ziplock bag, you need to double the marinade so you have enough to cover the pork. Pour the marinade over the pork chops. Squeeze out as much air as possible from the bag and seal it. Massage the bag so that the marinade covers all sides. Marinate in the fridge for 2 to 4 hours. (*Footnote 4)
Deep frying
Add 2” (5 cm) oil into a tall pan (or a fryer) that’s just big enough to fit the pork. Heat the oil to 350°F (176°C) over medium-high heat. Add the sweet potato starch onto a plate and spread it into an even layer. Prepare a rack-lined tray or a plate with a paper towel.
Remove the pork chops from the marinade but do not dry them off. One at a time, lay a pork chop into the starch and press down gently, then flip and press again. Scoop the starch around the edges and over any bare spots and press lightly so that the chop is fully coated. Shake off the excess starch from the pork.
Gently lower the pork chop into the oil. Cook for 1 to 2 minutes, until the chop is just becoming golden brown, flipping occasionally for even cooking and color. Remove the chop and lay it on the rack or towel-lined plate. Repeat with the remaining chops. Note, the oil temperature might drop after frying. It’s the best to measure the temperature after frying each chop and reheat the oil in between if needed, to produce a consistent result.
Once all the chops are cooked, bring the oil up to 375°F (190°C). Starting with the first chop that was fried, fry the chops again for 1 minute each, until they reach a deep golden brown color. Transfer the chops to the cooling rack or a fresh paper towel again.
Allow the refried chops to cool slightly. Then slice and serve hot as a main dish.
Store and reheat
To store the pork chops, let them cool completely before transferring them to a container. Store them in the fridge for up to 4 days or in the freezer for up to 2 months.
To reheat the refrigerated pork chops, place them in a 450°F (230°C) oven until heated through, 5 minutes or so. Flip once in between. Or you can reheat them in an air fryer.
To reheat the frozen pork chops, reheat them directly in a 350°F (176°C) oven until heated through. No thawing needed.",en-US,-1.0,,Omnivore's Cookbook,150,4 serving(s),1 serving,391 kcal,27 g,29.9 g,17.6 g,4 g,83 mg,312 mg,1.2 g,,,

Add the shredded coconut to a small pan and heat over medium-low heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until golden brown. Transfer to a small bowl and set aside.
Combine the tamarind paste with 1/4 cup of hot water in a small bowl. Let soak until very tender. When you’re ready to use the paste, press and stir the paste to mix it with the water and squeeze out the tamarind pods. Discard the pods before using.
Blend together curry paste ingredients, adding just enough water (or stock) to allow to blend properly.
Cook
Add the oil to a 3.5 quart pot and heat over medium heat. Add the curry paste and turn to medium-low heat. Cook and stir until the moisture is reduced and the paste begins to caramelize, 8 minutes or so.
Add the cardamom pod, cloves, and star anise pods. Cook and stir for 1 minute to release the fragrance.
Add the beef and the leftover upper portions of the lemongrass stalks. Turn to medium heat. Cook and stir for 1 minute, until the beef is evenly coated.
Add the coconut milk and soaked tamarind water (do not add the leftover tamarind chunks). Bring to a simmer. Reduce to low or very low heat, whichever is enough to maintain the very low simmer. Add the toasted shredded coconut, kaffir lime leaves, brown sugar, and salt. Stir a few times to mix well.
Cover the pot but leave a small gap about the width of your finger. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the beef turns very tender. The process can take anywhere from 2 to 3.5 hours. When the braising liquid starts to turn golden brown, check on the pot more often, every 15 minutes or so, and stir and scrape the bottom to prevent burning. At the end of cooking, the curry will turn golden brown and the oil will separate. Depending on the cut you use, it might end up with a lot of oil. You can skim the oil with a spoon and discard it before serving. Taste the beef and the curry. Adjust the seasoning by adding salt, if needed.

Bring to a simmer. Stir and cook until the sugar dissolves. Set aside to cool.
Place the chicken in a gallon-size ziplock bag. Carefully pour the cooled marinade mixture into the bag with all the ingredients. Seal the bag and squeeze out as much as air possible. Massage the bag a few times to evenly distribute the marinade. Place the bag in a large deep bowl so it “pushes” the marinade to fully cover the chicken. Plus the marinade won’t cause a mess if your bag accidently leaks. You can marinate the chicken in a large bowl, too. In this case, you might need to flip the chicken 2 to 3 times during the marinating process. Cover with a plastic bag if using a bowl. Let marinate overnight.
Chose a pot that is deep and just wide enough to hold the chicken. Add the chicken into the pot, breast-side-up. Pour in all the marinade with the ingredients. If the chicken is not covered, add up to 4 cups water. It’s OK if a small part of the chicken breast is not covered in the liquid.
Bring to a boil over medium high heat. Turn to medium-low or low heat. Use a fine mesh strainer to skim the foam and discard. When the broth reduces to a simmer, cover the pot. Simmer for 25 minutes. Turn off the heat. Let the chicken sit in the hot broth, covered, for another 30 minutes, or until the chicken is just cooked. To test, you can either insert a thermometer into the thickest part of the thigh or slice the skin that attaches the thigh to the body: the root of the thigh should no longer be pink. Soak the chicken in the broth, covered, if the chicken is not cooked. If the chicken is still very raw, return the pot to a simmer and cook until the chicken is fully cooked.
Once done, carefully transfer the chicken onto a big plate and drain all the liquid from the cavity. I usually do this wearing one oven mitt with a few layers of paper towel, with the other hand using a pair of tongs. Let the chicken cool enough to handle with your hands. Carve the chicken and slice the parts you plan to serve. Reserve the liquid to use as dipping sauce, or for braising (try using it to braise daikon radish or potato - so delicious!).

Combine all the marinade ingredients in a tall bowl (or small food processor) and chop with an immersion blender until it forms a runny paste. Pour into a 12-inch (30 cm) tray or baking dish.
Pat the duck dry with paper towels. Place in the tray with the marinade, skin side up. Sprinkle salt on the skin. Marinate in room temperature for 30 minutes up to 1 hour, or uncovered in the fridge for a couple hours to overnight. In this case, bring the duck to your kitchen counter for at least 20 minutes before cooking, so it will return to room temperature.
Cooking duck
Preheat oven to 425°F (218°C).
Right before cooking, pat the duck dry with paper towels. Score the skin 1/2-inch (1 cm) apart to a diamond pattern (but careful not to score the meat).
You might need to cook the duck in two batches. Place the breast pieces in a cold ovenproof 12-inch heavy skillet, skin-side down. Cook over medium heat, until they’re gently sizzling. Turn to medium-low heat. Cook until the skin turns golden brown, for another 10 to 12 minutes. Flip them over every 3 to 4 minutes. If the duck skin cooks too fast, turn to low heat. Transfer the cooked duck onto a plate and cook the rest using the same method.
Arrange all the duck pieces in the pan, skin- side down. Transfer the skillet into the oven and bake for 8 minutes, until the skin turns dark brown. Flip to skin-side up and bake for another 6 to 8 minutes, until the skin turns dark brown but not burnt. Transfer the duck onto a big plate, skin-side up. Allow to rest for 10 minutes without cover before carving.
Prepare the sides while resting the duck.
If you plan to serve the duck later, wrap each duck breast with aluminum foil when they are warm enough to handle and seal in a bag. Store in the fridge for up to 3 days. When you’re ready to serve, warm them up in a preheated 300°F (150°C) oven for 10 minutes.
Serving option 1 - Easy weekday dinner
Transfer 1 tablespoon rendered duck fat into a large skillet. Cook the sweet potato first over medium heat until it’s tender. Then add the zucchini and sprinkle with salt. Cook until the zucchini just turns tender and the sweet potato is almost caramelized. Transfer the ‘noodles’ to serving plates.
Slice the duck into thin slices and place on top of the vegetables, with plum sauce on the side.
Enjoy hot as a main dish.
Serving option 2 - Fancy Peking duck rolls
To serve Peking duck style, steam the pancakes in a bamboo steamer for 3 to 5 minutes until hot.
Slice the duck and place them on a plate. Serve with hot pancakes, sweet bean sauce (or hoisin sauce), cucumber and green onions on the side.
To assemble - place one pancake in the palm of your hand, brush some sauce on the pancake, place 2 to 3 slices duck in the center, top with a few strips of green onions and cucumber.

When the steak is ready to cook, remove the steak from marinade and pat dry with a paper towel. Discard the marinade. Brush the steak with a thin layer of oil. Lightly season both sides with sea salt.
To cook steak on a grill
Build a modified two zone fire and let the grill heat up.
Cook the steak on direct fire until the surface turns dark brown, about 3 to 4 minutes per side. Flip 2 to 3 times during grilling. Move the steak to the indirect zone and lift one side with a pair of tongs. Check doneness by inserting a thermometer into the thickest part of the steak: 51 degrees C (125F) for rare, 54 C (130 F) for medium rare or 57 C (135 F) for medium. Cook the steak more over direct heat if needed.
To cook steak on stove top
Heat a large cast iron pan or a heavy duty pan on high heat until hot. Place steak in the pan and sear for 2 to 3 minutes without moving, until the bottom side is browned. Check by lifting up a side of the steak to see if nicely browned. If so, flip the steak and sear the other side for 2 to 3 minutes. If you’re using a cast iron pan, remove the pan from the heat and let the steak continue to cook for 5 to 10 minutes on the residual heat.

Preheat oven to 120°C (250°F). Line a baking pan with aluminium foil (for easy cleanup) and top with a V-rack.
Prepare a plate. Transfer the neck and giblets from the goose cavity to the plate, and save for making stock later. Use a pair of poultry shears to trim the neck skin. Do not trim any skin from the bottom of the goose, because it will keep the meat moist during roasting.
Place goose on a working surface or cutting board. Use a toothpick to prick the goose skin on the breast and the thigh without piercing the meat, as many times as possible or at least about 1/3 inch (1 cm) apart. Note, the thickness of goose skin is not consistent, so start slow and do not prick too deep. If the skin is too tough to prick through, let the goose rest at room temperature for 30 minutes, or use your hands to massage the skin to loosen it up.
Rub both sides and the inside of the goose with a generous amount of sea salt.
Stuff citrus inside the goose, using as many fruits as you can. Use a few toothpicks to seal the bottom of the goose, to secure the fruits inside. Place goose onto the V-rack, breast side up.
Bake until the skin turns golden brown, 8 to 10 hours. You do not need to flip the goose or monitor the process.
If you’re going to serve the goose immediately, turn up the heat to 260°C (500°F) to brown the goose for another 5 to 10 minutes.
If you’re going to serve the goose later, remove the goose from the oven. Place the goose in a cool place, loosely covered with aluminum foil, if you’re going to serve it the same day. Alternatively, you could let the goose rest for 30 minutes, then carve it into breast and leg pieces. Use aluminum foil to wrap the pieces, seal them in Ziplock bags, and store them in the fridge for up to 3 days.

Thirty minutes before serving, heat oven to 200°C (400°F). Roast the whole goose for 30 minutes, or until the skin turns dark brown and crispy. If you have carved the goose, spread the pieces on an aluminum-foil-lined baking sheet, and bake until the skin turns crispy, 15 minutes or so.
Fruit sauce
While resting (or reheating) the goose, cook the fruit sauce. Dissolve potato starch in a few tablespoons of the sparkling wine.
Heat the rest of the sparking wine with the ginger powder in a small saucepan until bringing to a simmer. Turn to medium low heat and let simmer for 10 minutes so that the alcohol evaporates. Add the black currant jam and a pinch of salt. Stir and mix so that the jam incorporates with the wine. When the liquid comes to a simmer, taste it and adjust the flavor by adding more wine or jam.
Stir the cornstarch slurry again so that the starch fully dissolves. Slowly pour half of the slurry into the sauce, stirring at the same time. Continue adding more slurry to get the sauce to the desired thickness.
Serve
Remove the goose from the oven and let it rest for 15 to 30 minutes for an un-carved goose. You don’t need to rest it if you’ve already carved the goose. Do NOT cover the goose with foil. The stuffing will keep the meat hot.
Transfer the goose onto a large cutting board, carve, then slice the breast meat into bite-size pieces.

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Place the salmon fillets skin-side-down on a sheet pan lined with parchment paper. Discard the marinade. Bake for 8 to 15 minutes, depending on the thickness of the salmon. Once done, the salmon should be just cooked through and flake easily. If you like the raw texture of the salmon, you can cook it for an even shorter time so the inside is still a bit pink.

(Option 1) Using a mixer: Add flour and turn on at low speed. Gradually add water. Let mix until the surface of the dough becomes smooth, about 8 minutes.
(Option 2) Kneading the dough by hand: Add flour to a large bowl. Gradually add water and whisk flour with a spatula until water is fully blended. Dust both hands with dry flour and knead the dough. If there is dry flour in the bowl that is difficult to blend into the dough, add a bit more water to the dry flour, 1 tablespoon at a time. Knead until there is no dry flour left. The dough should feel springy and you should be able to easily pick it up without it sticking to the bottom of the bowl. Dust a working surface with dry flour and transfer the dough onto it. Knead until the surface of the dough turns smooth.
Wrap and seal the dough with plastic wrap. Let for 30 minutes up to 3 hours.
To make the filling
Prepare the filling while resting the dough. Combine ground beef, minced ginger, Shaoxing wine, light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, and ground Sichuan peppercorn (or black pepper) in a big bowl. Mix well until the liquid ingredients are fully absorbed.
Prepare and cut vegetables, but do not add them to the ground beef yet.
Right before assembling the pies, add the onion, carrot, salt and sugar to the beef filling. Mix well. Add sesame oil and mix again. (*footnote 1)
To assemble the pies
Add oil to a small bowl and prepare a small brush. Dust both hands and a large cutting board with dry flour. Transfer the dough to the cutting board and knead for a few times. The dough should be a bit softer, springy, and smooth.
Divide the dough into two equal pieces and put one piece back in the bowl and cover it with plastic wrap. Roll the other half into a ball. Press it into a flat circle. Use a rolling pin to roll it into a thin round disc, about 4 millimeters (1/8 inch) thick.
Brush a thin layer of oil on top. Sprinkle a pinch of salt over it and brush it again until evenly spread. Roll the round sheet into a long stick. Cut the stick into 6 equal pieces.
Work on the meat pies one at a time. Cover the rest of the dough with plastic wrap.
Pinch the two ends of each piece to seal the oil inside. Press the dough (the sealed ends are on the left and right) and gently roll it into a thin round disc. This step is help to create a layered crust.
Scoop 2 to 3 tablespoons of beef filling and place it on one side of the dough pancake, in a half-moon shape, as if making a quesadilla.
Fold the empty half over and press the edges together by hand. Turn the edge upward and press it again to further seal the pie.
Set pie aside and work on the rest of the dough in the same manner.
Cover the meat pies with plastic wrap while working on the rest of the pies, to prevent the dough from drying out.
To cook the pies
Heat a large nonstick skillet with 1 tablespoon oil over medium heat until warm. Transfer meat pies to the skillet without overlapping. Brush the top side with oil. Cover skillet and cook over low heat until the bottom side turns golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook the other side. Cover and cook until the bottom side turns golden brown, 3 minute. Transfer the meat pies to a plate. Cook the remainder of the meat pies the same way.
Serve warm with Chinese black vinegar. If the meat pie is not salty enough, blend 1 teaspoon light soy sauce with 1 tablespoon black vinegar as a dipping sauce.
To store the meat pie
Place meat pie in an airtight container. Store in the fridge up to 3 days or in the freezer for 1 month.

Remove the neck and innards from the chicken cavity and either reserve them for making stock or gravy or discard them. Remove the chicken fat from the cavity and set it aside for making the rice.
Place the whole chicken breast-side-up in a 5-quart pot or one that’s deep and wide enough to hold the chicken. Add water until it covers the chicken (about 8 cups of water in my case). Bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat. Gently move the chicken with a spatula so it does not stick to the bottom. Skim the foam with a fine mesh strainer until the soup becomes clear, 5 minutes or so.
Turn to medium-low heat. Add the ginger, green onion, and salt. Carefully flip the chicken using a spatula and a pair of tongs. Simmer for 10 minutes. Flip the chicken again so the breast side is up. Continue to simmer until the chicken is just cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes, depending on the size of your chicken. Test the doneness by poking the joint between the thigh and the body with a paring knife. The chicken is cooked if the juice comes out clear. Or you can use a thermometer inserted into the same joint. It should register 165 degrees F (74 C).
Prepare a large ice bath when the chicken is almost done.
When the chicken is done, immediately remove it from the pot and plunge it into the ice bath to cool. This process will tighten the chicken skin and stop the cooking process to keep the meat tender. Once the chicken is mostly cooled, 3 to 4 minutes, drain and pat it dry with paper towels. Transfer to a cutting board to air dry.
Strain and save the chicken broth for cooking the rice and making chicken soup.
Rice
While the chicken is cooling, prepare the rice. Heat the reserved chicken fat in a non-stick skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir occasionally, until the oil renders. You should have about 2 tablespoons of oil in your pan. If there isn’t enough chicken fat, add some butter to the pan (I used 1 tablespoon of butter).
Add the ginger, garlic, and green onion to the skillet. Cook and stir until fragrant, 1 minute or so. Add the rice and continue stirring until the rice turns pale yellow, 3 to 4 minutes. Turn to medium-low heat. Transfer 3 cups of chicken broth from the big pot you used to cook the chicken to the rice skillet. Cook, covered, for 12 minutes. Then remove the pan from the stove. Let rest, covered for another 10 minutes. Fluff the rice with a spatula. Taste the rice. Add a bit more salt, if needed, and mix well.
Sauce
While cooking the rice, prepare the chicken and the sauce(s). Separate the chicken into legs, breasts, and wings.
Prepare chili dipping sauce: add all the ingredients into a mini-food processor or the chopping container included with your immersion blender. Chop everything into a coarse paste.
Serving
There are two ways to prepare the chicken for serving. You can rub either sesame oil or sweet soy sauce onto the skin. Read more about the two options in the blog post above. Once done, slice the chicken breast into bite-sized pieces. Transfer to a big plate and garnish with cilantro, if using.
Before you serve, you may want to reheat the chicken broth. Garnish the hot soup with cilantro and green onion. Serve the soup with the rice and chicken. Enjoy!",en-US,4.34,,Omnivore's Cookbook,80,4 serving(s),1 serving,639 kcal,51 g,61.5 g,18.9 g,5.6 g,173 mg,560 mg,0.8 g,3.1 g,,

Combine the rice vinegar, sugar, and salt in a small pot. Heat over medium heat until the brine reaches a boil. Whisk to make sure the sugar dissolves thoroughly. Once done, transfer the pickling liquid to a tupperware container or a medium-sized bowl to cool.
Once the pickling liquid is mostly cooled (it’s fine if it’s lukewarm), add the daikon radish and carrot to it. Let marinate for 30 minutes while preparing the rest of the ingredients.
Once done, drain the marinating liquid and set aside the pickled veggies for assembling in the sandwiches.
Brown the ham
When you’re ready to serve, brown the ham. Heat a large nonstick pan over medium-high heat until hot. Add the ham. Fry until both sides are lightly caramelized, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Transfer the ham to a plate.
Assemble the sandwiches
Halve the baguettes without cutting all the way through the bread. Spread mayonnaise on both sides. Stuff with a handful of sliced cucumber, pickles, and ham. Squeeze on Sriracha sauce and / or lime juice, if using.

Rinse rice a few times and drain. Add water and mix. Let the rice soak for 30 minutes.
Rinse shiitake mushrooms. Place dried shiitake mushrooms in a medium sized bowl and add warm water to cover. Mix a few times so that the mushrooms are coated with water. Set aside and allow to rehydrate for about 20 minutes. (Slice fresh mushroom if you use it instead.)
Combine chicken, light soy sauce, Shaoxing wine, ginger, sugar, and salt in a large bowl. Mix well. Blend in cornstarch and mix well by hand until chicken is evenly coated. Marinate at room temperature.
When the shiitake mushrooms turn soft, carefully rinse mushrooms to remove any dirt. Drain and set aside.
Start cooking
Drain rice and add into a medium sized dutch oven (or clay pot). Add 350 milliliters water. Add Heat over medium high heat. Add 1 teaspoon oil and mix well. Bring to a boil while stirring regularly, just like cooking risotto. Turn to medium heat. Continue to cook and stir, until the water is almost absorbed by the rice, about 5 minutes. Cover and simmer over lowest heat for 10 minutes.
While simmering the rice, cook the chicken and mushrooms. Add the remaining 1 teaspoon of oil into a nonstick skillet over medium high heat until warm. Add chicken and let it cook for 1 minute without stirring. Place the chicken so that you cook the skin side first, until golden brown. Flip and cook the other side until golden brown, and the chicken is half cooked through. Turn to lowest heat. Transfer the chicken to a plate.
(Optional) Use a spoon to transfer the extra oil to a small bowl, until just a thin layer of oil remains in the skillet. If you use skinless chicken, skip this step.
Turn back to medium high heat and add shiitake mushrooms. Stir and cook for 2 minutes. Transfer to a plate and set aside.
When the rice is ready (the water should be fully absorbed by now), arrange chicken, mushrooms, and Chinese broccoli on top of the rice. Cover and continue to simmer for 18-20 minutes (the longer you simmer, the more crispy the rice on the bottom will be). Be careful - you should move as quickly as you can, so the temperature of the rice won’t drop too much.
While the rice is cooking, mix the oyster sauce with the sugar and garlic in a small bowl.
When the rice is done, remove from heat and uncover. Drizzle oyster sauce on top immediately, while the rice is hot, and mix everything well with a spatula. I suggest you scrape the rice from the bottom while the pot is still warm. Otherwise, it will be a bit difficult to scoop out.

Add 2 tablespoons oil to a large nonstick pan (or cast iron pan) and heat over medium heat until hot. Add the pork parts. Let cook for 4 to 5 minutes without touching, until the bottom is browned. Flip to brown the other side. It will take 10 to 15 minutes for the whole browning process.
Transfer the browned pork to a 6-quart (5.5-liter) dutch oven (or a heavy-duty pot). Add 10 cups cold tap water to the pot. Cook covered until boiling. Use a fine sieve to skim the brown bits from the top of the soup and discard them.
While boiling the broth, prepare the rest of the ingredients. Combine the dried shrimp with 1 cup warm water. Let rehydrate for 15 minutes or until soft.
Separate the heads of the fresh shrimp from the bodies and peel the shrimp. Reserve the brown bits coming from the heads when you seperate them. This is the best part and adds tons of flavor to the soup. Transfer the shrimp heads to a small bowl, and the rest of the shrimp meat to a container. Store the shrimp meat in the fridge until ready to use (or in the freezer if you plan to serve the noodle soup more than a day from now).
Add 1 tablespoon oil to the same nonstick pan you used to brown the pork. Heat over medium heat until hot. Add the shrimp heads. Cook until both sides turn a deep red color. Transfer heads to the stock pot. Add a ladle of water to the pan you cooked the shrimp in. Scrape off any brown bits stuck on the bottom and pour that water into the stock pot.
Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil, onion, and garlic to the same nonstick pan. Stir and cook until the edges turns golden brown. Transfer the onion and garlic to the stock pot.
Add the rehydrated shrimp to the nonstick pan. Add a bit more oil if the pan looks too dry. Stir and cook until slightly browned. Transfer the shrimp to the stock pot.
Add the fish sauce, star anise, cinnamon stick, dried chili peppers, white peppercorns, and sugar to the pot. Turn to low heat, cover, and simmer for 2 hours.
Once done, strain the soup by setting up a big bowl (or container) with a fine sieve on the top. Ladle the soup into the bowl through the sieve, a few cups at a time. Use the back of your ladle or a pair of tongs to press the solid ingredients in the sieve, to extract any residual liquid trapped in the veggies and shrimp heads. Discard the all the solid ingredients once done straining.
Taste the soup and adjust the flavor by adding soy sauce or salt. The soup should taste a bit salty by itself, because most of the ingredients in the noodle bowl will be boiled and not seasoned.
Now you can use the soup base to make noodle soup, or store it in the fridge or freezer until read to use. Set the stove on lowest heat to keep the soup hot if you’re going to assemble and serve the bowls immediately.
To prepare the noodle bowls
Bring a big pot of water to a boil. Blanch spinach for just 20 to 30 seconds, until tender. Transfer the spinach to a plate using a slotted ladle. Set aside.
Blanch the bean sprouts the same way, until slightly tender and still crunchly. Drain and set aside with the spinach.
Add the noodles into the same pot of water. Cook according to the instructions. Transfer to a colander, rinse with tap water and drain. Set aside.
Add the peeled shrimp to the boiling water. Cook until the shrimp begin to curl and are just cooked through, 1 to 2 minutes, depending on the size. Drain and set aside.
If you stored the soup base in the fridge, heat it until hot in the microwave or a pot on the stovetop.
Assemble the bowls
Divide noodles into 4 big bowls. Ladle the soup to cover the noodles. Add the boiled shrimp, fish cakes, bean sprouts, and spinach on top. Garnish with fried shallots, if using.
Serve the noodles hot with sambal sauce (or any other hot sauce you prefer), more fried shallots, soy sauce, and salt all on the side.

Transfer the whole tomatoes into a colander placed on a large bowl to drain the extra liquid. You can save the liquid to use later (see the last paragraph in the post to make a sweet and sour soup base, in a dish such as this tomato sauce fried noodles, or use it in various dishes). While draining the tomatoes, you can start to prepare the dumpling filling.
Remove the seeds from the tomatoes. Gently squeeze them to remove extra moisture. This process is very important, so the wontons won’t end up watery.
Finely dice 5 of the tomatoes to 2/3-cm (1/4-inch) pieces. Coarsely chop the rest of the tomatoes, and transfer them into another bowl for the egg drop soup later.
Make wontons
Combine ground beef, green onion, light soy sauce, Sichuan peppercorns, ginger, and sugar in a large bowl. Stir to mix well. Let marinate for 5 to 10 minutes.
When you’re ready to wrap the wontons, add the 5 diced whole peeled tomatoes, salt, and sesame oil into the bowl with the beef (*see footnote 3). Mix well with a spatula.
Prepare a small bowl of water. Prepare a tray or a large airtight container (one you can store in the freezer), and spray a thin layer of oil onto it. This will prevent wontons from sticking to the bottom.
Work on the wontons one by one.
Place 1 teaspoon of filling onto the center of the wonton wrapper (*see footnote 4). Wet the edge of the wrapper with your finger. Fold the wonton so it forms a triangle. Squeeze as much air as possible from the wonton, and press the edge to seal. Place completed wonton onto the tray (or container).
When you’ve finished wrapping 20 wontons, seal the tray and store it in the freezer. This process keeps the wontons fresh and prevents drying out.
Tomato egg drop soup
Add chicken stock into a pot and bring to a boil. Add the chopped whole tomatoes.
When the stock starts to simmer again, turn to low heat. Put a spatula (or a fork) against one end of the bowl with the egg in it. Slowly drizzle egg into the soup in a swirling motion. Mix the soup and taste it with a small spoon (be careful, the soup is very hot!). Add salt to adjust seasoning, if necessary.
Turn to lowest heat to keep the soup warm.
Cook wontons
Now, you should have two batches of wontons, 20 frozen and the rest fresh. Cook them separately, fresh first.
(Option 1) Wonton soup (*see footnote 5) - Bring a large pot of water to a boil over medium high heat. Add wontons one by one. Gently stir with a ladle to prevent sticking. Cook until the wontons are floating on top and start to inflate like balloons. Remove a wonton and carefully taste it to see whether it’s cooked through. If yes, transfer wontons to each serving bowl. Add the tomato egg drop soup. Garnish with cilantro, if using. Serve immediately.
(Option 2) Pan-fried wontons - Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large nonstick pan over medium high heat until hot. Place wontons into the pan. Add 2 to 3 tablespoons water and cover immediately. Turn to medium heat. Let steam for 2 to 3 minutes (you will need more time if you made larger dumplings, or if you’re cooking with frozen wontons), or until the bottom turns golden. Remove a wonton and carefully taste it to see whether it’s cooked through. If yes, transfer the wontons to a large plate.

Add bones, Shaoxing wine, and ginger into a large pot (or dutch oven). Add water until the pot is 4/5 full. Cover and bring to a boil. Stir the bones a few times during cooking to keep them from sticking to the bottom. Skim the foam from the surface until the soup turns clear, about 5 minutes.
(Optional) Turn off heat. Use a pair of chopsticks (or tongs) to transfer the bones to a plate. Place a strainer over a large bowl. Strain the broth and discard bones and other fragments. Rinse the pot to get rid of any extra foam. Transfer the broth and bone backs to the pot. (*see footnote 2)
Bring the broth to a boil again. Cover and cook over low heat (medium heat if using an electric stove) for 3.5 to 4 hours. The broth should continue boiling throughout the cooking. You don’t need to add water during the cooking, but remember to check the broth every 20 to 30 minutes. If the water runs too low and no longer covers the bones, add boiling water, 2 cups at a time. Don’t add any water during the final hour of cooking.
At the end of cooking, the broth should be reduced to about 1/3 (or less) of the original volume. Transfer the pork stock to a bowl to cool off.
(Optional) If the bones have any meat attached, you can separate the meat from the bones and eat it with a dipping sauce. To making the dipping sauce, combine 1 tablespoon light soy sauce with 1 teaspoon sugar. The meat will still be tender and moist and should be consumed as soon as possible. Or, you can store the meat and use it to cook fried rice later on.
(Optional) Leave the bones in the pot and cook another batch of stock. Add water until the pot is 1/2 full. Bring the water to a boil. Cover and cook for another 2 hours to get more stock. The broth should get quite concentrated again, but won’t be as thick as the first time. You can use this broth to cook soup directly, without adding water. To store, transfer the second batch of broth to a bowl to cool off. Discard ginger and pork bones.
You can use the stock to make soup and noodle broth and add it to stews and stir-fry dishes to enhance the flavor. If you use it to cook soup, don’t forget to add water to the stock to adjust it to taste. I used my first batch to cook four meals for two people, using the stock to cook exclusively soup.

Place on high heat until rated pressure has been reached. Turn to lowest heat. Simmer at rated pressure for 30 minutes. Turn off heat and allow the pressure to release naturally.
While simmering the beef tendon, prepare beef plate. Add beef plate into a large pot and add water to cover the meat. Bring to a boil over high heat. Turn to medium-low heat and keep a gentle boil going for 10 to 15 minutes. While boiling, skim the foam from the top of the broth and discard it. Turn off heat. Use a colander to transfer beef to a wok (or a large dutch oven). Let the soup sit about 10 minutes, then pour the soup into the wok until it covers the beef completely. (There may be some clotted blood on the bottom of pot. Try to avoid pouring it into wok.) Save the rest of the soup in the pot and set it aside for later use.
Heat the wok over medium heat. Add Shaoxing wine, chili pepper, ginger, scallion, bay leaves and black pepper (* see footnote) into wok and simmer, covered, for about 40 minutes. The beef tendon should be ready at that point.
Transfer beef tendon from the pressure cooker to the wok, and discard the broth.
Add curry powder, sugar and tomato paste into wok and mix well. Simmer, covered, for about 30 minutes, until beef starts to become more tender.
Add dark soy sauce, light soy sauce and salt into the wok. Mix well and simmer, covered, for one hour to one hour and a half (simmer time varies depending on the cut of beef). While simmering, stir the beef several times. Scoop the beef from the bottom with a spatula, to avoid burning it on the bottom of the pot.
After 20 minutes, watch the beef more closely and adjust the seasoning. If the liquid is becoming thick, but the beef is still tough, add more broth (from step 2), half a cup at a time. The liquid should be able to cover half of the beef. However, do not add too much water at the end of simmering, when beef is already soft.
When simmering has finished, adjust the seasoning again. The beef should be very tender and the soup quite thick. If the soup is not thick enough, boil uncovered over medium heat. Stand near the wok and stir constantly until soup thickens.
Serve warm with steamed rice.
The beef stew will stay good in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week, or in the freezer for up to a month.
To store the beef stew for your lunchbox or dinner during the next two weeks, place stew in a small bowl (2 to 4 servings per bowl) and set aside. After the stew has cooled down to room temperature, cover with plastic wrap and place in refrigerator, until stew has congealed and can easily be easily taken from the bowl.

Wrap the wonton
To make wontons, place a wonton wrapper in one hand, scoop a teaspoon of wonton filling and place it near the narrow side of the wonton wrapper (you can add more filling to the wonton if you like, as long as you can still wrap it). Fold the narrow side over the filling, then roll the filling all the way through the other side of the wrapper. Bind both ends and press together to lock the filling inside the wrapper. Brush a thin layer of water onto the wonton wrapper and press the ends together.
Make one wonton at a time, and line up all the wontons on a big wooden cutting board. If you aren’t going to boil the wontons immediately, use a damp paper towel (or cheesecloth) to cover the wontons to prevent them from drying out.
If you aren’t going to boil the wontons the same day, place them in an airtight container with several layers of wet paper towels on the bottom. This way, they can be stored in the fridge for up to 2 days.
(Option 1) Make the chicken soup base
Combine the chicken stock, ginger, and soy sauce in a pot. Bring to a boil. Let boil for 10 minutes. Turn to lowest heat to keep warm and start cooking wontons (see below).
Prepare 8 medium-sized bowls. Add the cooked wontons and bok choy. Add 2 tablespoons green onion, 1 tablespoon soy sauce and 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil into each bowl. Pour in 1 and 1/2 cups hot broth. Garnish with cilantro and chili oil, if using.
Serve hot.
(Option 2) Make the street vendor style soup base
To prepare 1 serving of wonton soup base, add a big spoon of cilantro, 1 tablespoon papery dried shrimps, a generous piece of dried seaweed, 1/4 teaspoon chicken bouillon, and some baby bok choy into a big bowl. Repeat the process to prepare the rest of the soup base in the other serving bowls. Cook wontons (see below).
To make 1 serving of wonton soup, use a ladle to transfer cooked wontons, bok choy, and the hot soup into a serving bowl with all the ingredients from the previous step. Drizzle 1 teaspoon soy sauce and 1 teaspoon sesame oil into the bowl and give it a gentle stir. The soup should be amber-colored. Add extra soy sauce or salt if the soup is not salty enough. Scatter green onion on top. Garnish with cilantro and chili oil, if using.
Serve hot.
Boiled the wonton
To boil the wontons, heat a big pot of water until boiling. Add 10 to 20 wontons at a time and boil over medium heat until wontons are floating on the surface of the water. Continue to boil until the wrappers are swollen, around 1 to 2 minutes for small wontons and 2 to 3 minutes for bigger ones. Take a wonton out with a slotted spoon and split it with a chopstick or fork. If the wonton is cooked through, stop heat immediately and transfer the wontons to individual serving bowls. If not, continue to boil until cooked through.
Once you’ve cooked the wontons, add the bok choy. Let cook until tender. Remove from the pot, drain well, and set aside.
To cook frozen wontons
Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat. Add wontons. Stir gently to prevent from sticking. Cook until bringing the water to a boil again. Turn to medium-low heat. Cover the pot with a small gap on one side, to prevent spilling. Continue boiling for 2 minutes (3 minutes for larger wontons). Stand beside the pot the whole time to monitor the broth.

Thoroughly rinse the chicken with tap water.
In a large dutch oven (or pot), add chicken and fill 3/4 of the way with water. Add scallion, ginger, jujubes, and ginseng. Cover and bring to a boil over high heat. Uncover and use a ladle to skim the foam from the surface, if any has accumulated. Turn to low heat and simmer, covered, for about 3 hours. If the water level gets so low that the chicken is no longer covered, add 1 to 2 cups boiling water. Do not add water during the final hour of simmering. The broth will have a pale brownish yellow color with a thick layer of oil on top.
When the stock is done, transfer chicken to a working surface to cool down. Use a mesh ladle or slotted spoon to scoop out the spices, and discard them.
You can use the stock immediately or store it.
To use the chicken
After the chicken has cooled enough to handle, separate the meat from the bones with a knife or by hand. You can use the chicken in soups or stir fried dishes.
*Tip - To use the chicken meat: Season with salt and pepper. Coat with a thin layer of all-purpose flour. Grill in a greased skillet until crispy.
To store the broth
Transfer the broth to an air-tight container and allow to cool, uncovered. Do not skim the oil from the top. The oil will protect the broth from bacteria when cooling off. It also adds great flavor to dishes, whether used along with the broth or as a cooking oil. You can easily remove the solid fat when the broth has cooled down completely. Store the broth in the fridge for 2 to 3 days, or in the freezer for up to 3 months. The fat can be used to cook Hainanese chicken rice or stir fry dishes.",en-US,4.8,,Omnivore's Cookbook,185,6 serving(s),,,,,,,,,,,,

Toast the Sichuan peppercorns in a small saucepan over medium heat until you can smell the fragrance and the Sichuan peppercorns turn a little darker. Transfer the peppercorns to a small bowl and set aside.
Soak the chili peppers in 2 cups of hot water until softened, 15 minutes or so. Use your fingers to press the air out from the chili peppers so they soak evenly. Once soaked, remove the tough stems of the chili peppers and discard them.
Combine the soaked chili peppers, Sichuan peppercorns, cumin powder, dried oregano, and salt in a blender or in a tall glass and use an immersion blender. Add 1/2 cup of the pepper soaking water without adding the residue at the bottom. Blend until it forms a fine paste.
Cook
Heat oil in a 5.5 quart dutch oven over medium heat and add the yellow onion. Cook and stir until the onion just starts to soften, 5 minutes or so.
Use your spatula to move the onion to the edge of the pan and add the ground beef in the center. Add the Doubanjiang. Let cook for a minute without moving. Then stir with a spatula to break the meat into smaller pieces and coat with the Doubanjiang. Cook, stirring frequently, until the meat is cooked and turns into small pieces.
Add the chili paste. Cook and stir for 2 minutes.
Add the diced tomato, tomato sauce, Shaoxing wine, and soy sauce. Cook and stir for 2 minutes.
Add the beef broth. Cook until bringing to a simmer. Turn to medium-low heat. Simmer, covered, until the beef turns soft, 30 minutes.
Add the kidney beans and stir to mix well. Cook for another 5 minutes. Taste the chili carefully and add more salt if needed.
Serve the chili over steamed rice. Garnish with chopped cilantro and avocado, if using. Serve as a main course.
Store
Store the leftover chili in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 5 days or in the freezer for up to 1 month. Reheat in the microwave or on the stovetop. The beans will continue to absorb liquid during storage.

Dip your finger into a bowl of water, wet the wrapper on both sides of the filling, bend the two ends toward the middle so they overlap, then press them together to seal the wonton.
Place the wrapped wontons onto a tray and cover them with plastic wrap or a few layers of wet paper towel to prevent drying out.
Cook
Combine the chicken stock, green onions, light soy sauce, and garlic in a pot. Cook until bringing to a boil. Let simmer for at least 5 minutes.
While the wonton soup is cooking, heat another pot of water over medium-high heat until bringing to a boil. Add the number of wontons you plan to serve and make sure the wontons do not crowd the pot (the wontons should form a single layer in the pot without too much overlap). Gently stir to prevent them from sticking to the bottom. Cook until the wontons float on top. Continue boiling for another 1 to 2 minutes, until the filling is just cooked through.
Once the wontons are done, immediately transfer them into serving bowls and pour in the hot broth. Taste a wonton with the broth. Add more salt to the broth, if needed. Drizzle with sesame oil and serve hot.

Use a dining spoon to distribute the sauce over the mushrooms. Mix with chopsticks until the mushrooms are evenly covered with the sauce. Marinate for 15 minutes.
Add 1 tablespoon peanut oil to a nonstick skillet and heat over medium high heat until warm. Add 2 teaspoons green onion and stir a few times.
Cook mushrooms in batches. Spread them across the skillet without overlapping them. Save the marinating liquid for later use.
Let mushrooms grill without stirring them. When the skillet gets hot, turn to medium heat (or low heat if the skillet starts to smoke). When the bottom side turns golden, flip with chopsticks (or tongs) to grill the other side. Keep grilling and flipping, until both sides turn golden brown, with slightly charred edges. The process took me 8 minutes, but your cooking time will vary depending on the type of stove you’re using. Transfer the mushrooms to a plate and set aside.
Add the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil and 2 teaspoons of green onion. Continue to cook the remainder of the mushrooms. The cooking process will be shorter this time, since the skillet is quite hot already. Adjust heat between low and medium to cook the mushrooms slowly, with the skillet remaining hot. The mushrooms should be slightly charred and dehydrated without getting burnt. (I cooked two batches with a 9"" / 24 cm skillet. You might need to cook more (or fewer) batches depending on the amount of mushrooms and the size of your skillet. Be sure to adjust the amount of oil accordingly.
When the last batch of mushrooms is cooked, add the previous batch(es) back into the skillet.
Pour the marinade over the mushrooms. Keep cooking over medium low heat until the liquid is absorbed, 2 to 3 minutes.

Combine all the marinade ingredients in a small pot. Bring it to a boil, then simmer for 5 minutes. Remove the pot from the stove and let it cool.
Boil the eggs
Prepare a pot that is large enough to hold all the eggs without overlapping them. Add just enough water to cover the eggs. Heat over medium-high heat until boiling. Lower the heat to medium.
Transfer the eggs to a ladle or a colander. Slowly lower the eggs into the water to prevent them from cracking. Adjust the heat so the water maintains a slow boil.
Bring a small pot with just enough water to cover your 6 eggs to a boil.
(Optional) If you wish to keep the egg yolks in the center of the eggs, stir the water in a consistent circle for the first minute of cooking.
Cook for 6 minutes for runny yolks, 8 minutes for semi-firm, or 11 minutes for hard boiled.
While the eggs are boiling, prepare an ice bath (or a big bowl of cold water if you don’t have ice).
When the eggs are done cooking, run cold water over them for 30 seconds. Add the eggs to the ice bath and let them cool completely, about 10 minutes.
Marinate the eggs
Once the marinade is cooled until no longer hot to touch, transfer it into a tall container that is large enough to hold 8 cups of water (*Footnote 4).
Carefully crack the egg shells by tapping them with the back of a spoon or by gently rolling them on the counter. Starting from the bottom, begin peeling each egg, dipping it back into the water as needed to help loosen the shell. Make sure to peel off the egg membrane completely, so the egg will marinate evenly. Once peeled, place the eggs into the marinade container.
Marinate the eggs in the fridge for a minimum of 6 hours before serving. If you want to serve the eggs sooner, simply drizzle some extra marinade onto the cut eggs. Store the eggs in the marinade in the fridge for up to a week.
How to serve
You can serve the eggs over steamed rice or boiled noodles, drizzled with extra marinade and some homemade chili oil (if you wish). You can also make noodle soup by combining some marinade with hot noodle boiling water. Enjoy!",en-US,5.0,,Omnivore's Cookbook,390,6 serving(s),1 serving,,2 g,6 g,5 g,1 g,212 mg,676 mg,1 g,,,

When the rice is done, release pressure using fast release.
At this point, the rice on the bottom will be moist and fragile. Use a rice paddle (or a fork) to gently fluff the rice by lifting from the bottom. Cover again and let rest for 10 to 20 minutes. This will redistribute the moisture and cook the rice more evenly.
Once the rice has rested, you’ll noticed the texture is not so wet anymore. Now you can serve the rice.
Quick tip: rinse your pressure cooker while it’s still warm, and the residual starch will come off easily. Once the pot has completely cooled off, you might need extra soaking time to clean the pot.
Store
If you don’t serve the rice right away, transfer and spread it on a large plate or tray to cool. (*see footnote 2)
Once the rice has cooled down (it usually takes 15 to 20 minutes), immediately transfer it into small airtight containers or freezer bags (*see footnote 3). Mark the contents and date on the containers. Store in the fridge for up to 2 days or in the freezer for up to three months.
Reheat
To reheat frozen rice, transfer it to a microwave-safe container without thawing. Cover and reheat the rice in 1-minute increments on full power, until rice is hot.

Add the milk into a small bowl and warm to approximately 100-110°F (38°C), about 30 seconds in the microwave. The milk should be warm, just a bit above body temperature. Add a pinch of sugar and the active dry yeast. Let sit for 5 minutes so the yeast will activate.
While the yeast activates, add the rest of the ingredients into your mixer bowl.
Once the yeast is activated, you should see bubbles on the surface of the mixture. Pour it into the mixer bowl. Mix with a spatula until the dough just comes together. Cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 20 minutes.
Install the dough hook on your mixer (I used a KitchenAid). Start at low speed, then gradually increase to setting 8 out of 10. Knead for 10 to 12 minutes, until the dough is very smooth. Stop the mixer in the middle and scrape the dough from the sides of the bowl. Test the dough by pulling a piece of it using both of your hands. It should stretch into a very thin and translucent sheet. The dough should be wet and a bit sticky.
Grease a big bowl with a thin layer of oil. Place the dough into the bowl. Cover with plastic wrap. Let rise until the dough doubles in size, about 1 hour.
2nd rise
Line a 9” x 9” (23cm x 23 cm) baking pan with parchment paper.
Punch the air out of the dough. Transfer it onto a lightly oiled working surface. Divide the dough into 9 even pieces by cutting it into 3 even strips, then further cutting each strip into 3 small pieces. Each piece of dough should weigh 68 to 70 grams.
Shape the dough one piece at a time. Tuck the dough onto itself by pinching the dough from all sides into the center using your fingers, creating a round shape. Then roll the dough in a circular motion with your palm against the table, until it forms a round ball. Place the dough balls onto the parchment paper, evenly spaced, in a 3-by-3 array.
Cover the baking pan with plastic wrap. Let rest again for another 35 to 45 minutes, until the size has doubled.
Bake
Preheat the oven to 350° F (176° C) while resting the shaped bread rolls.
Right before baking, gently brush a thin layer of milk onto the tops of the bread rolls.
Bake the milk bread rolls on the middle rack for 20 to 25 minutes, until the top turns golden brown. You can also test the doneness by inserting an instant-read thermometer into the middle of the center bun. It should register at least 190°F.
Let the bread rest in the pan for 5 minutes, then transfer it onto a cooling rack.
Serve warm or at room temperature.
Store
Once the milk bread rolls have cooled completely, you can store them in an airtight container on your kitchen counter for up to 2 days. The rolls will stay very soft at room temperature. You can also warm them up in the microwave it for 10 seconds or leave them in a 350° F (176° C) oven to warm up before serving.
For longer storage, place the dinner rolls in a ziplock bag, squeeze out as much air as possible, and store them in the freezer for up to a month.

Add rice and water to cover into a large bowl. Use your fingers to gently rinse the rice in a swirling motion, then drain the water. Add water to cover the rice with 1” (2 cm) of water. Soak at room temperature overnight. Drain thoroughly before cooking.
Prep
Heat 1 cup of water in the microwave until hot. Add the dried shiitake mushrooms. Soak until the mushrooms turn soft, 15 to 20 minutes. Once done, squeeze the liquid out of the mushrooms into the soaking water. Slice the mushrooms thinly. Reserve the soaking water for cooking.
Cut the rest of the ingredients while rehydrating the mushrooms.
Cook
Heat the butter in a 4-quart dutch oven (or tight-sealing heavy pot) over medium heat. When the butter has melted, add the shallot and shiitake mushrooms. Cook, stirring frequently, until the onions turn golden and translucent, 6 to 8 minutes.
Add the Chinese sausage. Cook and stir for 1 minute.
Pour in the Shaoxing wine. Use your spatula to release any brown bits stuck on the bottom of the pan. Cook until the wine has evaporated completely.
Add the rice. Stir to mix the rice evenly with the other ingredients. Add the chicken stock and salt. Stir to mix well.
Add the water chestnuts. Pour in the soy sauce and dark soy sauce. Gently stir a few times to mix the soy sauce.
Cook until the liquid comes to a low simmer. Turn to very low heat and cover the dutch oven. Steam until the rice is cooked through, 20 to 25 minutes. Uncover the pan and taste the rice at the 20-minute mark. If the rice still has a bit of a raw texture, let it cook for another 5 minutes.
Once done, uncover the pan and stir with a rice paddle or spatula to fluff the rice. Garnish the stuffing with sliced green onions.
Serve hot as a side.
This dish can be cooked 1 to 2 days in advance. Reheat it in the same dutch oven in a 350 ℉ (176 ℃) oven with the lid on until warm. You can reheat it in the microwave, too. To heat it evenly, be sure to stir the rice several times over the course of reheating.
Clean-up
It’s very likely that the sticky rice will stick to the bottom of the pot once you’re done cooking. This is due to the starchy texture and the added soy sauce. To clean up the pot, add 2” (5 cm) of water to the pot and boil for 5 to 10 minutes, until the sticky rice can be lifted easily with a wooden spatula.

Use your fingers to gently rinse the rice in a circular motion a few times, then drain off the water. Repeat 1 to 2 times.
Instant Pot Method
Add the rice and water to your Instant Pot. Cover and seal the lid. Select high pressure, and set the timer to 25 minutes. Once done, let the pressure release naturally.
Once the pressure has fully released, open the lid and stir the congee with a ladle. It might look thin once it’s done cooking, but it will thicken up a bit once you stir it well and let it sit for a few minutes. If you want to change the texture of the congee, turn on the “Saute” function and let it boil down for a few minutes and stir constantly, until it turns thicker. Or you can pour in a bit of hot water and stir it, to thin it out.
Stovetop Method
Add the rinsed rice and water to a medium-sized or big, tall pot. Bring to a boil over high heat. Stir a few times to make sure the rice doesn’t stick to the bottom.
Turn to medium-low or medium heat to reduce to a simmer. Cover the pot halfway to keep the water boiling without spilling over. Simmer for 45 to 50 minutes, depending on the texture you’re looking for. Stir the congee a few times during cooking. Towards the end of cooking, the congee will get quite thick and sticky. Stay near the pot and stir frequently over the last 10 to 15 minutes. It will easily spill if covered too much or if the heat is too high. The rice will stick to the bottom if you don’t stir enough.
Serve
Serve the congee hot or warm with any topping options you prefer. You can also replace steamed rice with the congee as a side, to serve with other dishes.
Store and reheat
You can store the congee in a sealed container in the fridge for 3 to 4 days. The congee will continue to thicken.

Combine the flour, yeast, baking powder, sugar, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer. Slowly pour in the milk while using a spoon or spatula to mix with the flour. Once the liquid is fully combined, turn on the mixer and knead for 5 minutes until it forms a firm and coarse dough ball. Alternatively, you can use your hands to knead the dough and it should take about 10 minutes.
Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the dough rest for 10 minutes.
After 10 minutes, knead the dough using your hands, for another minute, until smooth. Cover with plastic wrap. Rest the dough until it doubles in size, about 1 hour.
While the dough is rising, prepare 10 pieces of square parchment paper about the size of your palm, to hold the buns while steaming.
(Optional) If you’re making the gua bao filling and quick pickled shallots on the same day, prepare them during this time.
Divide the dough
Once the dough has doubled in size, punch the dough gently with your hand to release the air bubbles. Knead for 1 minute.
Cut the dough into 2 equal pieces, then further divide each piece into 5 smaller pieces. For a more accurate result, use a scale to measure the dough to make sure it’s 48 g per piece.
Work on the dough pieces one at a time, forming them into balls by pinching the loose ends into the base until taut and round. Then roll the dough on the table using your hand shaped like a dome, lightly pressing the dough so it forms a round ball. Place the dough balls on a large plate and cover them with plastic wrap to prevent them from drying out.
Shape the buns & 2nd rise
Place the dough balls pinched side down onto a clean working surface. Using a rolling pin, roll each ball into a 1/4"" (1/2 cm) thick oval that's twice as long as it is wide (about 2.25” x 4.5”/ 5.5 cm X 11 cm). Flip the dough oval over and lightly roll again to smooth it out,
Brush the top of the dough oval with a thin layer of oil (*Footnote 1), fold the oval in half, and place it on a piece of parchment paper you prepared earlier.
Place the shaped buns in a steamer basket, leaving at least 1” (2.5 cm) between the buns. Cover and let rise for another 15 to 30 minutes before cooking, or until the size is 1.5 times bigger.
Cook the buns
Right after you finish forming the first batch of buns, prepare the steamer by adding water into the base. When the buns have risen the 2nd time, add the covered steamer rack with the risen buns over the steamer. If using a metal steamer, use two layers of clean kitchen towels between the steamer rack and the lid to prevent water from dripping. Cook covered over medium heat until steam starts coming out of the pot, then turn to medium-low heat. Steam for another 10 minutes.
After 10 minutes, turn the heat off but leave the lid on for another 5 minutes. Do not open the lid at this time! The buns might deflate without the proper resting.
Once done, remove the buns onto a wire rack to cool. Then you can use the same steamer to cook the rest of your buns.
Workflow note
You probably will need to cook the buns in batches depending on the size of your steamer. While you’re steaming the first batch of the buns, the second batch or the third batch might have been formed and rested. In this case, transfer the buns onto a big plate and cover them with plastic wrap. Transfer the buns into the fridge to slow down the rising. Wait until the previous batch of buns is done. Remove the rested buns from the fridge, let them return to room temperature for 2 minutes, then start steaming them. It’s important to NOT allow the buns to rise too much. If the buns are rested for too long, they will deflate once steamed.
Serve, store & reheat
Once the buns are steamed and slightly cooled, you can use them to make gua bao, serve them with moo shu chicken, or stuff them with any braised meat.
You can store the steamed buns in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 4 days, or in a tightly sealed ziplock bag in the freezer for up to 3 months.
To reheat the refrigerated buns, you can place the buns on a plate and cover them with a layer of wet paper towels, then heat them up in the microwave. You can also heat the buns in a steamer, which will create a softer result.
To reheat the frozen buns, place them directly in a steamer without thawing them and steam until fully heated through. If you want to reheat them in the microwave, you should thaw the buns first.",en-US,5.0,,Omnivore's Cookbook,140,10 serving(s),1 serving,118 kcal,24 g,3.5 g,0.6 g,0.2 g,1 mg,37 mg,1 g,0.9 g,,

Prepare the squid by removing the head, cutting out the eyes, and removing all the internal organs of the squid, and discarding the inner cuttlebone – which is like a piece of plastic. Rinse the squid in water, then slice the body of the squid into rings, and cut the tentacles into bite sized pieces.
Using a mortar and pestle, pound the black peppercorns for a few seconds until broken, but not powdery. Then add the garlic, and pound just for a few seconds to bruise the cloves.
For the green onions, cut off the roots, then slice into bite sized pieces about 5 cm in length.
Heat your wok or frying pan to high heat, then add oil to the pan.
Wait until the oil is hot, then toss in the black pepper and garlic, and stir fry for a few seconds.
Add the shrimp paste, and mix and mush into the oil, making sure it begins to dissolve and turn fragrant.
Once the garlic starts to turn golden brown, add the squid, and stir fry continuously for about a minute.
Season with oyster sauce, and continue stir frying.
Stir fry the squid for about 3 minutes altogether, making sure not to overcook it, or it will turn rubbery.
When the squid is fully cooked, the final step is to add the green onions, mix through once, then turn off the fire or heat of your stove. The green onions will still be slightly raw, but will continue to cook with the other hot ingredients.

Peel the garlic, and shallots, and cut the turmeric into pieces, and toss them all into the blender.
Add about a cup of water, and blend for a few seconds until pureed.
NOTE: Be warned that turmeric stains, so don’t use a nice blender!
To prepare the green papaya, first peel the outer green skin, rinse it in water to remove the sap, then shave off thin bite sized pieces of papaya so you have thin wedges. Cut the papaya like you’re whittling a piece of wood. Then set aside.
For the limes, slice and squeeze them into a separate bowl.
Put a big soup pot on the stove and turn to medium heat, and add in all the curry paste you just blended.
Add 2 liters of water to the soup, using some of the water to rinse out the blender, and add to the pot.
Add the shrimp paste, and stir the soup to make sure the shrimp paste fully dissolves.
Take the green papaya, add it all to the soup, stir quickly, then put the cover on to bring to a boil.
Once the gaeng som is boiling, gently add the pieces of fish.
But here’s the Thai Aunty trick – don’t stir the soup until the fish is fully cooked. If you stir the soup when the fish is still raw, your soup will taste fishy (according to Thai cooking practice).
Boil the soup, without stirring, for about 5 – 8 minutes.
When the fish is finished cooking, you can stir gently, and then turn off the stove pretty quickly so you don’t overcook the fish.

Probably the first thing you want to do (if you’re using charcoal, which I would recommend), is to get the charcoal going first, so it’s ready when the fish is prepared.
Make sure you rinse your fish with water and then pat them dry with a paper towel.
Take your lemongrass stalks and beat and bruise them with something hard, like a mortar, or a rolling pin or something like that. This is going to bring out the lovely flavor of the lemongrass. Also prepare a small handful of kaffir lime leaves.
Fold the lemongrass in half and begin to stuff the fish with a stalk of lemongrass and about 10 kaffir lime leaves. Depending on how big your fish is will determine how many stalks of lemongrass you can fit. I put 2 – 3 lemongrass stalks in each fish in the video. Make sure it’s tight, but also make sure not to push so hard that you break the flesh of the fish.
In a large mixing bowl or pan add ½ kilo bag of salt, sprinkle in 2 tablespoons of all purpose flour, and add about 1 tablespoon of water. Mix it up thoroughly, massaging the mixture with your hand, until it’s fully mixed. You want the salt to be a little moist so it sticks to the fish easily.
Add the fish to the pan and start plastering it with the salt mixture. Pat and rub the fish with the salt, making sure to cover the entire fish, and all over the head and tail. Do the same to both fish.
For grilling the fish, you want to have a steady, yet quite low heat. Make sure you have a bed of coals, and if they are too hot you can either tone them down with a scoop of ashes, or push the really hot coals to one side of the grill and put the fish on the other side (using a little indirect heat). You can also add more coals as you keep on cooking. You want to slow cook the fish without them burning on the outside. My fish took almost 1 hour to grill. So aim for low heat for slow cooking.
Once your fish is on the grill, it’s time to get started on the seafood sauce (below).
Try to wait for about 15 minutes before you flip the fish. If you flip it too early, when the salt hasn’t dried out completely yet, the fish skin might get stuck onto the griddle. Flip the fish as little as possible.
Keep roasting until the fish feels firm and the white salted skin has turned crusty and golden. It should take about 45 minutes to 1 hour.
Take the fish off the grill, and set it on a platter.
To eat the fish, you can either use a knife or scissors, and from the top of the fish, cut through the skin. The skin should cleanly lift off the fish revealing moist and beautiful meat.
Thai grille fish (pla pao) is delicious with both sticky rice and white rice, and lots of seafood sauce!
Peel about 15 cloves of garlic and grab about 20 Thai bird chilies (prik kee noo suan พริกขี้หนูสวน). Normal Thai chilies will work too. Pound ½ teaspoon of salt, the garlic, and chilies using a mortar and pestle. Doesn’t need to be super fine, but make sure there are no big chunks.
In a bowl, add the pounded garlic and chilies, 6 tablespoons of fresh squeezed lime juice, 3 tablespoons of water, 2.5 tablespoons of fish sauce, and 1 tablespoon of sugar. Mix everything together until the sugar is dissolved.
Taste the seafood sauce. Really, it’s up to you how it tastes, but you want it to be slightly salty, sour, and slightly sweet.

Alternatively, you can soak for at least 4 – 5 hours, but overnight is best.
Take the sticky rice out of the water (and the grains should be softer and a little swollen), and place into a bamboo steamer, or any type of steamer. Cover the steamer with either a lid, or you can do what I did and cover the basket with a cloth, then a metal lid – just to keep all the steam within the rice.
Add water to a pot with the steamer over the pot (just make sure the water doesn’t touch the sticky rice), and once the water comes to a boil, steam for 15 – 20 minutes (usually 15 minutes for me is perfect) on a medium heat.
After 15 minutes take off the lid carefully, because it will be very hot, and just grab a taste test of the sticky rice to make sure it’s soft and fluffy. If it’s still a little crunchy, steam for a few more minutes, but if it’s good to go, turn off the heat and either eat immediately, or transfer to some sort of airtight container or basket to hold until you’re ready to eat.

If you wanted, you could also make this recipe with 3 – 4 kilos of chicken pieces, or really, however much chicken you want.
For this gai yang (ไก่ย่าง) to be at its finest, it’s best to marinate the chicken overnight and grill it the next day, but if you don’t have the time, marinate the chicken for at least a few hours.
Peel about 4 bulbs of garlic, which should be about 30 – 40 cloves in all.
Thinly slice 2 stalks of lemongrass and cut off the roots of 8 stalks of coriander.
Now comes the hard part, pounding everything using a mortar and pestle (If you don’t have a mortar and pestle you can blend the ingredients in a food processor (but I’d really recommend you invest in a Thai style mortar and pestle).
Add small amounts of garlic, lemongrass, black peppercorns, and coriander roots to the mortar and pestle and pound them until the oils come out, and you have a coarse paste. Keep pounding until all the marinade ingredients are finished. You’ll probably need to load the mortar a few times.
Put all the pounded marinade ingredients in a mixing bowl, stir them up, and add 4 tablespoons of light soy sauce, 1 tablespoon of dark soy sauce, 1 tablespoon of fish sauce, and 2 tablespoons of palm sugar. Mix everything together while adding about 8 tablespoons of water to the mixture. You should end up with a potent marinade that looks like a chunky garlicky sauce.
If you’re using whole chickens, you’ll want to butterfly cut them starting from the breast side down to the butt. Flatten the chickens out. This is going to prepare it for the grill (Watch the video to see how to do it).
In a big pan or mixing bowl start to rub the marinade on the chicken, making sure the garlic, herbs, and soy sauce go into all parts of the chicken. Rub down both chickens using all the marinade.
Cover the chickens and allow them to rest overnight. You might stir them a couple of times if you remember.
The next day, take out your chicken, and the first step is to light your charcoal. You want a low even heat, coals that aren’t too hot, but a low and even.
Put the chicken on the grill and begin cooking!
Wait about 20 minutes or so (but monitoring them to make sure they don’t burn), before making your first flip. You can baste the chicken with the extra marinade.
Cook the chicken on low heat for about 1.5 hours, until the chicken is cooked through to the bone and the skin is golden dark brown on the outside.
Take the chicken off the grill, and dismantle the bamboo supports.
If you have a Chinese cleaver, first cut the chicken in half from the neck to the butt, and from there cut off the drumstick, wing, and chop the rest of the chicken into strips.
Semi-dried tamarind pulp can usually be bought at the supermarket in a small block. To rehydrate it, get a couple tablespoons of hot water and start to work the tamarind into the hot water. This should turn it into a nice tamarind water sauce.
In a bowl, mix 1.5 tablespoons of khao kua (toasted sticky rice, recipe here), 1.5 tablespoons of chili flakes, 1 tablespoon of sugar, 3 tablespoons of fish sauce, and 8 tablespoons of tamarind juice.
Mix all of the ingredients together.
After mixing up the sauce, make sure you taste test. You’re looking for the perfect sweet, sour, and salty combination. You might need to add more tamarind juice, more sugar, or more fish sauce to balance it out.
Top off your gai yang sauce with some chopped up cilantro.

Peel then mince 3 cloves of garlic, slice the chicken into small bite sized pieces, and slice the Chinese broccoli into 1.5 centimeter strips.
Heat the wok (or frying pan) on a medium heat and add about 2 tablespoons of oil.
Wait until the oil is hot, and then fry the garlic for about 10 seconds or so, making sure it sizzles in the hot oil.
Add the chopped chicken to the wok and stir fry for it about a minute until the chicken is nearly all the way white in color and cooked pretty well though and through.
Now, turn down your heat (or if you’re using an electric stove you can even move your pan off the burner for a moment).
Toss in the rice noodles, the Chinese broccoli, 1 tablespoon of light soy sauce, ½ tablespoon of dark soy sauce, and a ½ teaspoon of sugar.
Still on low heat, start to fold the noodles gently by picking them up with the spatula from the bottom, and folding them over (If you stir fry too hard, the stickiness from the noodles can make them turn into a big noodle blob – believe me, I’ve done this too many times and it’s not pretty!).
Cook the noodles for about 1 -2 minutes. If it gets a little dry, you can drizzle in a tiny bit of oil.
After the noodles are well mixed, scoot the noodles to one side of the wok, and proceed to crack an egg into the empty side.
Now it’s time to crank up the heat on your stove – for the final step we want a little char on the noodles and egg for great flavor.
Scramble the egg, and then fold the noodles onto the egg, sort of when it’s half cooked. Let the heat sear the egg for a few seconds and then start folding the noodles and egg together. With a hot flaming fire, you should get a little char to both the noodles and the egg.
Fry for about 30 more seconds, making sure to be gentle with the noodles, and then turn off the heat and dish it out.

Turn on your stove to medium heat, and add about 3 cups (or ½) of the coconut milk to a medium sized saucepan. Put the pot on the heat and immediately toss in the sliced galangal and lemongrass.
As your coconut milk begins to heat, move back over to your cutting board and slice up the chicken. I used 2 chicken breasts for this recipe. Slice the chicken into medium sized chunks – they can be kind of big in size.
Just before the coconut milk comes to a boil, add the chicken, and then add the other remaining 3 cups of coconut milk. Now, turn down the heat to a medium low, as you don’t want the coconut milk to heat too fast or burn.
Prepare your Thai chilies by peeling off the stems and then just slice them diagonally. Go ahead and add them directly to the soup.
Give the soup a quick stir, and then add about 200 grams of oyster mushrooms (it was about 2 handfuls for me).
Your coconut milk should not boil, but just maintain a nice low heat. Because coconut milk is so delicate, when you stir, be sure to move your spoon in 1 direction only, otherwise you run the risk of the coconut milk getting too shaken and it will start to curdle. Be gentle with the coconut milk.
Move back over to your cutting board and peel and slice 2 small white onions into thick wedges (if your onion is really big, just use 1). Immediately toss the onions into the soup.
Next, cut your tomatoes in the same way as your onions, into thick wedges. Wait until your tom kha gai (ต้มข่าไก่) is just about to boil, and then add the tomatoes.
Take the kaffir lime leaves, break them with your hand, and toss them directly into the soup. Breaking the kaffir lime leaves is going to release their flavor.
Now add about ½ teaspoon of salt to begin with (taste to add more)
Mix your tom kha gai slowly and gently, for about 5 – 10 minutes, making sure it doesn’t come to a full boil – and if it does – turn down the heat to even lower. You want the chicken, onions, tomatoes, and other ingredients to be fully cooked, but you don’t want to overcook the coconut milk.
After about 5 – 10 minutes of cooking, go ahead and turn off the heat completely.
Go back to your cutting board, slice up a handful of fresh cilantro, and add it to the soup. Give it a quick stir, and the cilantro will cook enough from the already hot soup.
The final step is to juice a couple of limes into a separate bowl and then add about 4 tablespoons of lime juice to the tom kha gai (ต้มข่าไก่). Again, just give it a quick and gentle stir, and it’s ready to be served.
Make sure you do some taste-testing to make sure it’s salty and sour enough. You may need to add a little extra salt or lime juice to get the flavor you want.",en,4.6,,"Thai Street Food, Restaurants, and Recipes | Eating Thai Food",30,3 – 4,,,,,,,,,,,,

Doesn’t need to be too small or evenly cut, this is just going to make it easier to pound. Set them all aside on a plate.
For the lemongrass, first remove two or three of the outermost layers (the outer layers of the lemongrass are tough and not flavorful). Start from the bottom (thicker side) of the stalk and cut off the end, and then slice it into thin slivers, about half the way to the top. Toss out the top half of the lemongrass stalk as its not flavorful and it’s tough also. Set it aside.
Take your kaffir lime and carefully slice off the outer green bumpy skin. You want to slice only the outer green skin, without getting the white pith. Cut the green skin off about half of the lime.
Using a mortar and pestle, start pounding the dry Thai chilies first. They might be a little bouncy as they are dry, but the more you keep on pounding them, the more they will loosen up and their oils will start to form.
Once you’ve pounded the dry chilies for about 10 minutes, add the fresh Thai bird chilies – you can add the stem and all. This may help add some moisture to your curry paste. Keep pounding, maybe for about 15 minutes or so, until the chilies are broken down.
Start adding pieces of turmeric, garlic, and shallots to your curry paste, and keep on pounding and pounding. If your mortar and pestle isn’t big enough, you may need to put some of your paste into a separate bowl and do a couple batches.
Gradually add in all the lemongrass and the kaffir lime peel and keep on pounding. It took me over an hour to pound this southern Thai curry paste. You don’t want any chunks, and you want to fully release the oils of all the ingredients – that’s when you’re going to get the best flavor out of your paste.
Your curry paste should be a nice oily buttery consistency and quite smooth when you’re done. Then add the black peppercorns, and salt, and keep pounding until the peppercorns are completely pounded in. Keep on pounding until you have a beautiful pasty blob.
The final step is to add the shrimp paste. Pound it slowly, more mashing it into the paste. It should get quite a bit stickier and dryer with the addition of the shrimp paste. Once the shrimp paste is fully mixed in, your curry paste is ready.",en,4.8,,"Thai Street Food, Restaurants, and Recipes | Eating Thai Food",90,None,,,,,,,,,,,,

For the garlic, just peel all the cloves (and I used the shaking pot method, which actually works quite well when you need a ton of garlic like this), and set the peeled cloves aside.
For the turmeric, chop it into small pieces and set it aside.
Next step is to take your mortar and pestle and start grinding the garlic and turmeric. I had to do little by little in many batches and then mix it up in a bowl. It should only take about 5 or 10 minutes to pound – you’re not going for a paste, but more just an oily mixture of crushed garlic and turmeric. Alternatively you could use a food processor or blender, just don’t make it too smooth.
To prepare your fish, you want to make sure it’s already de-scaled, and also that the insides have been removed – you can either do it yourself, or it might be easier to have the butcher do it when you buy it.
Take the fish, and you want to make three diagonal slices on the fillet of the fish, make sure you cut through the skin, but don’t go too deep into the flesh.
Next you’ll need a big bowl or basin and go ahead and put the fish in.
Take some salt, and give each of the fish a small sprinkle on both sides, and rub your hands over the salt to make sure it’s spread evenly over the skin of the fish.
Grab the turmeric garlic mixture and start piling it onto the fish, all of it. You can gently massage the fish, mostly to make sure every part of the fish is coated in orange goodness. Also, take some of that turmeric and garlic and really stuff it into the slits we made in the side of the fish – this will ensure the flavor gets embedded in the fish.
Set aside the fish, and leave it to sit for about 10 – 15 minutes.
While you’re waiting for the fish to marinate for a few minutes, you can prepare your oil for deep frying.
Turn on your stove to a medium heat and add about 1 liter of oil (however much you think you need) to your pot or wok.
We’re going to fry the fish first, and then the garlic and turmeric, so first shake off all the garlic and turmeric from the fish, and leave it in the basin for later (this is because the fish will take longer to fry, so we’ll fry the fish first, then the garlic and turmeric after).
Make sure your oil is fully hot, and then gently slide the fish into the oil carefully. They should immediately start to sizzle up and bubble.
Fry the fish for about 5 – 8 minutes on each side, but it will really depend on the size of your fish – so if your fish is bigger you’ll need more time. While it fries, make sure you carefully scrape the bottom of your pan with a spatula to make sure your fish doesn’t stick.
When your fish looks nice and golden brown on the bottom side, it’s time to flip it over, and again, fry it for about 5 – 8 minutes on the other side.
Keep monitoring your fish closely, making sure it doesn’t stick.
When the fish is brown and golden, and you think it’s fully cooked through, take it out of the oil, and set it in a strainer to drain.
Now we’re going to fry the garlic and turmeric. Keep your stove on a medium heat, a carefully drop in all the garlic and turmeric. It will probably bubble up, then settle down.
Slowly and carefully stir with your spatula, making sure nothing sticks and the garlic and turmeric is fries nice and evenly.
The garlic and turmeric will probably take about 5 – 10 minutes to fry. You want to make sure it turns dark golden in color, and you’ll be able to feel the crispiness with your spatula.
When the garlic and turmeric is done, strain it all out, and let it drain for a few minutes.
Take your fried fish, put it on a plate, and then pile on all the fried garlic and turmeric.",en,4.0,,"Thai Street Food, Restaurants, and Recipes | Eating Thai Food",40,Feeds about 2 – 3,,,,,,,,,,,,

When the oil is hot and sizzling, drop in the egg. Let it sizzle and bubble up, and at the same time, splash some of the hot oil onto the top of the egg (don’t flip the egg, unless you really want to).
After the egg looks about right to your cooked likeness (I like mine runny), take it out, drain the excess oil, and put it on a plate for later.
Cut the chicken into small bite sized pieces.
Rinse and peel the garlic and chilies, and pound them in a mortar and pestle (alternatively you can just mince them with a knife). They don’t need to be super fine, you just want to bring out the oils and flavors from the garlic and chilies.
Pluck a good sized handful of holy basil leaves off the stems.
Now it’s time to start cooking. Heat your wok on high heat, and add about 1 tablespoon of oil to the pan.
When the oil is hot, add the chilies and garlic. Stir fry them for about 20 seconds or so until they get really fragrant, but don’t let them burn or get too dry.
Toss in your chicken. Keep stir frying continuously. At this stage you want to continue to stir and cook your chicken until it’s just about fully cooked all the way through (depending on the size pieces of chicken and how hot your fire is, it should take about 2 – 3 minutes). If it starts to get dry, add just a tiny splash of water.
Add 1 teaspoon of oyster sauce, ½ teaspoon light soy sauce, ½ teaspoon sugar, and finally a splash of dark soy sauce. Keep stir frying for about another 30 seconds.
Grab a handful of holy basil, toss it into the pan, fold it into the chicken, and then immediately turn off the heat (if you’re using an electric stove, you’ll want to remove the pan from the burner). The holy basil really only needs to cook for about 5 seconds, and it will continue to wilt and cook from the existing heat of the chicken. This step is important because if you cook the basil for too long, it loses some of its glorious flavor and gets slightly chewy.",en,4.9,,"Thai Street Food, Restaurants, and Recipes | Eating Thai Food",20,1 serving(s),,,,,,,,,,,,

Then I like to start by squeezing my limes. This is not the first step of the recipe, but it’s best to have your limes squeezed so when you need them later, you don’t need to rush to squeeze them all. Slice about 10 limes and juice them all into a small bowl, and set them aside for later.
Take your stalks of lemongrass, and first tear off the outermost leaf and throw it out. Then, I like to use a mallet to lightly pound the lemongrass to release the flavors. Then just slice it diagonally into 1 inch strips or so.
Take about 1 thumb sized chunk of the root part of galangal, and chop it into slices.
Coarsely break about 10 kaffir lime leaves - no need to cut them, just tear them - which is going to help release their flavor.
Peel about 5 cloves of garlic.
I used about 10 Thai bird chilies (prik kee noo) for this recipe, but you can use however many you’d like. First, take off the stem, and then you can either just slice them in two pieces, or give them a little pound on your cutting board like I did (just be careful of flying seeds). You can also remove the seeds if you’d still like the chili flavor but not as much heat.
Throw the lemongrass, galangal, kaffir lime leaves, garlic and chilies into the water. You can put on the lid just so it starts to boil and release all the herb flavors quicker.
Now prepare your shrimp (or whatever meat of choice you’re making tom yum with). Since I used goong mae nam (กุ้งแม่น้ำ), freshwater shrimp, I first chopped off all the tentacles.
Boil your soup with all the herbs in it for about 10 minutes, and you can go ahead and toss in the shrimp and turn the fire to low.
Then add your mushrooms, which you should pre rinse beforehand.
Take two roma tomatoes and two small white onions and slice them into wedges - you want them to be big and chunky. Then go ahead and add them to the tom yum.
If you’re using shrimp for this tom yum recipe, you might get some foam build up on top of your soup, in which case you can just lightly skim it off the top and toss it out.
Boil the tom yum for about 2 - 3 minutes.
Next, add about 6 tablespoons of fish sauce first, and 2 teaspoons of sugar. You may need more of each, but start with that.
Boil your tom yum for another minute or so and then turn off the heat. You don’t want your tom yum to be overcooked. The mushrooms and onions should be soft, and then it’s ready.
Once your heat is off, go back to your lime juice and add about 8 tablespoons of lime juice (depending on how sour you like it, I like it really sour).
Make sure you taste test until your tom yum is perfectly sour and salty. You might need to add more fish sauce, sugar, or lime juice.
Finally chop up a handful of fresh cilantro, throw it in the soup, and give your tom yum a final stir. The lime juice and cilantro taste fresher and more vibrant when not boiled, so that’s why I turn off the heat before adding them.
You now have Tom yum goong nam sai (ต้มยำกุ้งน้ำใส), the clear version of tom yum.
For this recipe, I took out about ½ of the tom yum and set it aside as the clear version, and then made the other ½ as the creamy version.
Turn your heat back on low.
Add about 3 heaping tablespoons of Thai roasted chili sauce (nam prik pao น้ำพริกเผา) to your soup and stir it in.
Also about 10 tablespoons of evaporated milk.
Mix it all in and let your soup heat up for about 1 minute.
At this stage, you’ll need to taste test and evaluate. The roasted chili sauce and creaminess from the evaporated milk will alter the flavors from the clear version, so you might need more lime juice and more fish sauce. Just keep taste testing until it’s exactly how you like it.
And there you have the creamy version of tom yum.",en,4.8,,"Thai Street Food, Restaurants, and Recipes | Eating Thai Food",30,3 - 5,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prepare the shrimp by taking off the head and peeling the shell, and then devein them. If you want to prepare your shrimp Thai style, peel the body, but leave the tail on.
Stink beans grow in a long twisted hard pods, so the first thing to do is peel the stink beans out of the outer shell. The skin is quite tough so it’s easiest to take a sharp knife and slice the bean, almost in half first. Then peel back the skin and remove the stink bean inside. You’ll also see an inner, beige colored skin that coats the stink beans, and you want to remove that too. Go through all the pods and remove all the stink beans – this will probably take a few minutes. If you haven’t watched the video yet, make sure you watch it for a better explanation of how to peel the stink beans. That’s all for the prep work, it’s time to get stir frying.
Put your wok or frying pan on a medium heat and add about 2 tbsp of oil. I normally like to use less oil when I stir fry Thai food, but with this stink bean curry recipe, you really need to add some oil so the curry paste gets nice and fragrant when frying and doesn’t stick to the bottom of the pan.
When your oil is sizzling hot, add in the curry paste, first start with 2 tbsp. – you can always come back and add more later if it’s not flavorful enough. Then add about ½ tsp of shrimp paste.
Stir fry the curry paste, working it into the oil, and scraping it off the bottom of the pan. Immediately you should start to smell those beautiful chilies, the lemongrass and the turmeric. Keep stir frying for about 30 seconds to 1 minute, making sure the paste doesn’t burn, but is nice and fragrant.
Add the shrimp, and stir fry continuously for about 30 seconds. The shrimp should pretty quickly start to turn from transparent to pink orange in color. If the curry paste starts to get dry, you can toss in a splash of water, and that should give you some liquid to work with as well as a little extra sauce.
Then toss in the stink beans, and stir fry for about another 30 seconds or so. You want to keep frying hard so the curry paste doesn’t stick to the pan.
Season with ½ tbsp of oyster sauce and ½ tbsp of sugar (the normal Thai way is to use sugar, so I showed it this way in the recipe, BUT, when I cook it myself I normally omit the sugar or use just a tiny bit – so up to you how much sugar you want to add).
Again, if your goong pad sataw (กุ้งผัดสะตอ) get’s dry, add another splash of water, and then stir fry for just another minute.
The final step is to take 6 – 8 kaffir lime leaves, and tear them off the stems directly into the curry. When you tear the kaffir lime leaves, it will release their flavor. Stir fry for just 10 seconds, and then turn off the heat.

You can also devein them if you’d like, but for small shrimp, to me it doesn’t really matter.
Peel 2 cloves of garlic, and then just finely mince them
Slice ¼ of a sweet white onion into medium sized strips
Finely dice about 3 – 4 green onions
Take just 1 leaf of Chinese broccoli (kai-lan), slice it in half first along the spine, and then slice it into 1 centimeter sized strips

Add in a little less than ½ of your rice first. This is going to soak up all those delicious shrimp juices and oils and keep your rice nice and dry. Stir fry for about 10 more seconds – This is a little known trick to make good rice, so it remains nice and dry
Scoot all your rice to one side of the pan, and then crack in the egg into the empty side
Whirl the egg up, let it cook for a few seconds, and then start to mix it up with the rice and shrimp
Keep stir frying for about 20 seconds until the egg is fully cooked, and then add in the rest of your rice, and give it a quick stir
Add ½ tablespoon of soy sauce, ½ tablespoon of oyster sauce, just a pinch of sugar (optional), and continue stir frying your rice, making sure all the sauce get mixed in
Then add your chopped Chinese broccoli and onions, and stir fry for another 30 seconds until the vegetables wilt, but they can still be crisp and not fully cooked
Lastly, toss in your green onions, stir it a few more seconds, and it’s ready
Immediately dish your fried rice onto a plate
Slice off a wedge of lime, and serve it on the plate next to the rice
For the final touch, I like to sprinkle some freshly ground black pepper on top to give some extra flavor
Add 3 tablespoons of fish sauce to a small bowl
Slice about 5 Thai chilies (you can add more or less, up to you), and add them to the fish sauce

You can then either use a cheese grater to shave the papaya, or you can do it the traditional way and hack at the papaya with your knife until there are numerous vertical cuts, then shave off the top layer into thin slivers, and repeat. I like the traditional method as you get bigger, un-even, pieces of green papaya. Cut enough green papaya to have a big handful worth for this recipe.
Add 2 cloves of peeled garlic and 5 chillies (or however many you like) to the mortar (krok). Pound them for a few seconds until the garlic is crushed and chilies are reduced to small bits.
Add ½ tablespoon of palm sugar, 1 tablespoon of fish sauce, and then squeeze the juice from 1 – 2 limes into the mortar. You can always start with less seasoning and add more to your liking.
Mix and pound the dressing, making sure the palm sugar gets fully dissolved into the liquid (so no one bites into a chunk of pure palm sugar).
Add about 1 tablespoon of roasted peanuts (no need to measure, just grab some with your hand), 1 tablespoon of dried shrimp, and then roughly slice in the tomatoes into the mortar.
Pound the mixture for about 30 seconds, lightly breaking up the tomatoes, shrimp, and peanuts. No need to pound too hard.
Last step is to toss in a big handful of the green papaya shavings. Mix it all together, doing a combination of using just a spoon and pounding lightly, but no need to pound hard. Make sure the dressing is coating all the green papaya and that the salad is evenly mixed through and through.",en,4.9,,"Thai Street Food, Restaurants, and Recipes | Eating Thai Food",15,1 serving(s),,,,,,,,,,,,

Heat a frying pan on low heat, toss in the uncooked Thai sticky rice (no oil). Stir continuously, kind of like you’re roasting peanuts or coffee. Toast the rice until it turns from white to golden yellow, almost to the point where it looks like brown wheat. It will also be very fragrant and smell almost like popcorn. It took me about 15 minutes or so.
Once the rice is finished toasting, and has cooled off a bit, put it into your stone mortar and pestle. Pound the rice until it turns into a coarse powder (a blender or food processor will also work fine). Put your toasted sticky rice powder in a bowl aside.
Add 300 grams of minced pork to a small sized saucepan with a handle. Fry the pork, breaking it into small minced pieces, until it’s fully cooked all the way through. For best flavor, leave all the oils that come out (but if you want to be healthier, you can also drain the pork oil, and add in a splash of water instead). Take the pork off the heat.
Leaving the pork in the same pot, add 1 heaping tablespoon of the toasted rice powder into the pork. Also toss in ½ – 1 tablespoon of chili flakes.
Add a pinch of sugar, ½ tablespoon of fish sauce, and squeeze in the juice from 1 – 2 limes (I used about 1 ½ full limes, but I like it quite sour).
Give the pork and the seasoning a quick stir.
Peel and slice the shallots, finely mince about 5 green onions and a few culantro leaves (if you have them), and just pluck about 20 or so mint leaves off the stem. Throw everything into the saucepan with the pork.
Give the larb moo a good mix, making sure all the spices and dressing coats the pork.
Taste test. See if it needs more fish sauce for saltiness, lime juice, or chili flakes. Get it the way you want it.

Peel the garlic and shallots, and slice off the skin of the kaffir lime. Cut all the chili paste ingredients into small pieces, to make them easier to grind in a stone mortar and pestle.
In a stone mortar, first add ½ tsp of salt, then begin pounding the Thai dry chilies until you have chili flakes. Then add the fresh chilies, and keep on pounding. Next add the rest of the ingredients and keep pounding for about 15 minutes. You don’t need it to be smooth like a Thai curry paste, but you’re just looking for a coarse chunky chili paste. You could alternatively use a food processor or blender.
If you use whole fish, like I did, fillet the fish by slicing the meat off both sides. Then cut the fish into medium sized pieces, about ½ the size of a deck of cards.
In a mixing bowl, add the boneless fish (skin still on is best), add the pounded chili paste, and season with salt. Mix thoroughly so all the fish is coated with chili paste.
Tear or cut the banana leaf into 30 – 40 cm (1 foot or a little more) pieces. Prepare about 12 pieces.
Banana leaves have a strong side and a fragile side – keep this in mind. Take two of the banana leaf pieces, with the white dull side up (green shiny side down), and give the leaves a quick wipe with a wet cloth. Place one leaf down, then layer another on top of it, but turn it 180 degrees. So there should be a strong edge on one side, and a fragile edge on one side, but two leaves opposite of each other – one strong and one fragile side together.
Place a handful of fresh lemon basil and Thai sweet basil in the center of the leaf, then top with a couple pieces of fish and chili paste. Then tear a couple of kaffir lime leaves, and add them to the top of the fish.
To wrap it up, fold in one side, then the other side, then pull in the long ends, and fasten them at the top of the packet with a toothpick. It should be square or rectangular package.
On medium heat, grill each packet of aeb pla nin (แอ๊บปลานิล) for about 15 minutes, flipping occasionally. The outside banana leaf wrapper will blister and blacken, but the fish inside will remain protected and absolutely delicious.",en,5.0,,"Thai Street Food, Restaurants, and Recipes | Eating Thai Food",105,6 packets,,,,,,,,,,,,

Add 3 teaspoons of white pepper corns to your mortar and pound it until it’s a fine powder.
Add ½ teaspoon of cumin and ½ teaspoon of coriander to the pepper and mix it all thoroughly, and then set them aside in a small bowl.
Take 8 dry spur chilies (prik chee fa haeng), soak them in water for a few minutes to rehydrate them, then drain the chilies. Cut off their stems, and you can then chop them into small centimeter pieces. Some people take out the seeds to make their red curry paste less spicy, but in my opinion you’ve got to keep the seeds.
Add the chopped dry chilies to the mortar along with ½ teaspoon of salt and start pounding. Keep on pounding for about 5 – 10 minutes until most of the chilies are nice and broken, the oils are coming out, and it’s starting to looks almost tomatoey.
Step back over to your chopping board and peel about 10 – 14 cloves of garlic. I used a type of Thai garlic, which is small and extra pungent variety, but using regular garlic will work fine too. If the cloves are really big, use about 8.
Next peel 5 small shallots (Thai shallots are really small, about the size of a grape), so if you have big shallots you might need just 2 or 3. Chop them into small pieces.
Take 1 stalk of lemongrass, pull off and discard the outermost leaf, and then slice it from the bottom into small slivers. You want enough for 1 tablespoon.
Take the fresh coriander roots from about 3 stalks, cut off the roots, slice them into small pieces, and again you want about 1 tablespoon worth of coriander roots.
Take your galangal, and if you can find baby galangal that’s not too old, it will be softer, but whatever you have is alright. Again, slice it into pieces and you want enough for 1 tablespoon worth.
Next take a fresh kaffir lime and slice off only the green skin. You want to slice off the skin very delicately, making sure you get mostly green, not cutting off any of the white pith. I used the skin from about ½ of the kaffir lime.
Toss all of those ingredients into the already pounded chilies.
Pound and pound and pound until you’ve got a buttery, oily, and extremely fragrant Thai red curry paste. This should take anywhere from 15 – 30 minutes, and yes it’s tough work, but it’s so worth it (again, you can alternatively use a blender or food processor).
When your paste is buttery and smooth, go back to your bowl of white pepper and dry spices, and mix it into the paste. You don’t need to pound hard now, just mix it all in and smooth it out.
Final step is to add in just ½ teaspoon of shrimp paste. Pound your paste altogether and make sure the shrimp paste is fully mixed in.",en,4.9,,"Thai Street Food, Restaurants, and Recipes | Eating Thai Food",45,About 8 – 10 tablespoons of paste,,,,,,,,,,,,

The finer you shave the lemongrass, the more flavor it will add, and the the easier it will be to chew.
To prepare the kaffir lime leaves, you want to grab about five or six leaves, which come as a pair, then I like to fold them over, so you’ve got a nice layered sandwich of kaffir lime leaves. Slice off any of the big stems if there are any, and then finely slice them into thin strips.
I included the spur chili in this recipe mostly to give the khua kling (คั่วกลิ้ง) a beautiful red accent color, but it’s not what gives the dish its spice – that comes from the curry paste. For the spur chili, just cut off the stem, slice the chili in half, and then slice it into thin diagonal strips. Set all those ingredients aside, and we’ll come back to them later.
Turn on your stove to a medium high heat, heat up your wok or pan for a few seconds, and then add about 3 tbsp. of southern Thai curry paste (it may be kind of dry, but since this is a dry curry, you don’t want to add any oil).
One of the tricks my wife taught me, so the curry paste doesn’t burn, is to quickly add in just 1 spoon of meat into the curry paste and start to stir fry it. This will give the curry paste a little extra moisture, but it will still get that direct heat that you want, so the curry paste reaches its maximum flavor potential.
Fry the curry paste for 2 – 3 minutes, and then add in the rest of the meat. Your pan should be quite hot, and due to the dryness, it might start to stick to the bottom. So you want to really work the wok hard by scraping and getting all that good flavor off the bottom of the pan.
Stir fry the meat until it’s broken into small minced pieces, and almost all the way cooked through, then toss in just a pinch of sugar, depending on how much you like (I used about ½ teaspoon, but I know some Thai cooks would use a whole spoon in their recipe).
Give it a quick stir, then add the lemongrass.
Quickly stir it, then toss in about ¾ of your shaved kaffir lime leaves. Stir fry for about 1 minute.
Just a few seconds before turning off your heat, add the sliced red spur chili, stir fry for a few more seconds, and turn off your heat, but keep frying for another minute or so.
Grab a bowl, and dish out your khua kling (คั่วกลิ้ง).
The final step is to take the remaining portion of your finely shaved kaffir lime leaves (of you can slice more if you used them all), along with a handful of sliced Thai bird chilies, and sprinkle them on top of your plate of khua kling (คั่วกลิ้ง).",en,4.8,,"Thai Street Food, Restaurants, and Recipes | Eating Thai Food",20,1 plate,,,,,,,,,,,,

You should immediately start to smell the aroma of the shrimp paste. Allow the shrimp paste to just sizzle for about a minute on either side, then remove from the grill. This step is optional, but it increases the fragrance of the shrimp paste. Set aside.
Peel the shallots and garlic, and rip off the stems of the Thai bird’s eye chilies.
In a mortar and pestle, pound the garlic, shallots, and chilies for about 10 minutes until you get a nice semi-smooth oily paste.
Add about 10 pea eggplant to the mortar, and gently crush them, just to release the seeds.
Then add the shrimp paste and palm sugar to the mortar, and pound and mix simultaneously for about a minute until the mixture is even.
Then add about 3 tbsp of lime juice to start and mix everything together, still in the mortar, with a spoon.
Now to taste test. The nam prik kapi (น้ำพริกกะปิ) should be like a sauce in texture, and should be salty, sour, and spicy, with only a faint hint of sweetness. Add more lime juice or chilies as needed to balance the taste.
Once finished, garnish with whole Thai bird’s eye chilies and more pea eggplant.

Remove the fish from the water, drain fully, and leave to cool.
Once the fish is cool, carefully take off the skin and debone all the meat from the fish, and flake the fish in your fingers so it’s almost like deboned minced fish. Discard the bones and skin.
Set aside the fish for later.
Cut off the ends of the lemongrass and tear off the outer few layers, then shave the lemongrass into small pieces. Cut the turmeric into small pieces as well.
In a mortar and pestle (or alternatively a food processor), start with a pinch of salt, then pound the dry chilies first for about 10 minutes.
Then add the lemongrass, turmeric, garlic, and peppercorns, and pound for about 30 minutes until a relatively smooth paste.
Once the paste is pretty smooth, the final step is to add the shrimp paste, and pound and mix for another 5 minutes.

If your chicken hasn’t been de-gutted, you’ll need to first carefully remove the entire organ system. You have to cut a slit in the back of the chicken, about 6 cm in length, and then reach in with your hand to remove all the organs. Be careful not to break the intestines or innards as it can cause the chicken to get bitter.
Once your chicken is de-gutted, stuff the feet of the chicken into the body cavity, and then twist the wings to the top of the chicken – this is just going to keep its limbs from flapping while being boiled.
Put enough water into a pot to cover your chicken, and then bring it to a boil (chickens not in yet). Once your water is boiling, reduce the heat to low.
Add the salt into the water and dissolve it.
Add the chickens to the boiling water and boil them for about 35 – 45 minutes, if you’re only doing one chicken it might only take 30 – 40 minutes – so just keep an eye on it. If you have a meat thermometer, that could come in handy.
Once the chicken is firm and bouncy, you can remove the chicken from the pot, and lay it in a pan to cool.
That’s it for the boiled chicken.
For a proper Thai street food version of khao man gai (ข้าวมันไก่), you need to have some chicken oil. I made some by taking extra chicken skin, putting it into a hot wok for about 10 minutes and sizzling all the oil out of it – we probably had about 1.5 cups of chicken oil. However, if you don’t want to use chicken oil, you can also just use any kind of vegetable oil.
Take the garlic, and blend it up, or use a food processor. Alternatively, you can just mince it up as well. In Thailand they just use the full cloves of garlic, without even taking off the skin.
Then take the minced garlic and deep fry it in either the chicken oil or vegetable oil. You want to fry it on a medium low heat, and stir it continually in the oil so the garlic doesn’t stick. You want the garlic to become nice and golden brown, without burning or getting too dark. It should take about 5 – 8 minutes.
Once your garlic has been fried, strain and drain it.
Add your uncooked rice to a rice cooker pot, and first give it a good rinse and drain.
Add the fried garlic to the uncooked rice, along with the chicken broth (from cooking the chicken), and a bit of salt to taste.
Stir the uncooked rice and broth all around, even it out in the pot, and finally press cook on your rice cooker. Let the rice cooker work its magic.
When the rice finishes cooking, let it sit for a few minutes, and then open the cover and just fluff it up.
Cut up your winter melon or daikon radish into about 5 cm pieces. For the winter melon, I first sliced off the skin, then cut it into quarters, removed the seeds, and sliced it into pieces.
Go over to your chicken broth, and try to skim off the top layer of oil, and discard.
Now bring your chicken broth to a boil, and then add in the pieces of winter melon or radish.
While your soup is boiling, you can go ahead and add in as much salt and pepper to your tasting. It shouldn’t be too salty or too peppery, you’re looking for just a soothing broth.
Boil your soup for about 15 minutes or so, until the winter melon or daikon radish is soft.
Final step for the soup is to turn off the heat, take a handful of cilantro, chop it up, and toss it in. Give that a quick stir, and it’s ready.
For the sauce, just chop up the ginger, and then just throw it, with all of the ingredients into a blender or food processor.
You don’t need to blend it up completely, it can be a little chunky (depending on your preference).
Transfer your blended sauce over to a pot or wok, and you want to just bring it to a boil for a few seconds – this is not really for any reason other than to kill any bacteria and make your sauce last longer (this sauce should last in the fridge for about 3 – 4 days, but of course it probably tastes the best when it’s freshest).

Wash the chicken clean and remember to set aside the piece of chicken fat at the back cavity. Transfer the chicken to a plate and pat dry with a paper towel. Lightly rub the chicken with the salt. This will give the chicken skin a nice sheen. Set it aside.
Bring the water, along with the ginger and scallions, to a boil in a large stockpot. Before adding the chicken to the pot, rinse the chicken under running water to wash away the salt. Carefully lower the chicken into the boiling water, positioning the chicken breast-side up. Now is a good time to adjust the water level so the chicken breast just pokes above the water (so you aren’t left with dry white meat).
Once the water boils, carefully lift the chicken out of the water to pour out the colder water that is trapped in the cavity. Carefully lower the chicken back into the pot. Bring the water to a boil again, and cover the lid. Turn off the heat, and leave the pot covered on the stove for 45-50 minutes (set a timer). To check if the chicken is done, stick a toothpick into the thickest part of the drumstick. If the juices run clear, it’s cooked through.
When the 45-minute timer (for the chicken) is almost up, prepare a large ice bath. Once the chicken is cooked, carefully lift the chicken out of the pot, drain the water from the cavity and lower it into the ice bath. Take care not to break the skin. After 15 minutes in the ice bath, the chicken should be cooled completely, drain and cover with clear plastic until ready to cut and serve. The ice bath stops the cooking process, locks in the juices, and gives the chicken skin better texture.
To make the rice:
While the chicken is cooling, make the rice. Heat a wok over medium heat. Add the chicken fat and render for about a minute. Stir in the minced garlic and fry briefly, making sure it doesn’t burn.
Add the uncooked rice. Stir continuously for about two minutes.
Turn off the heat. Scoop the rice into your rice cooker and add the appropriate amount of chicken stock (instead of the usual water. This amount may vary depending on your rice cooker) and salt. Close the lid and press START.
If you don’t have a rice cooker, you can follow these steps. When you wash your rice, let it soak for an additional 20 minutes. Then drain the rice and follow the same steps above, but instead of transferring the rice mixture to your rice cooker, transfer it to a medium/large pot. Add 3 cups of chicken stock and the salt, giving it a quick stir. Cover the pot and bring to a boil. Once it boils, immediately turn down the heat to the lowest setting. Let the rice simmer and cook (covered) for 10-15 minutes until the rice is done. It’s not quite as foolproof as the rice cooker, but you should get a very similar result. Just be sure to keep an eye on it; burnt rice is no fun.
While the rice is cooking, let’s prepare the three signature dipping sauces. You can also start preparing these sauces while the chicken is cooking in the pot.
To Make Sauce 1: The Ginger Garlic Sauce
Grind the ginger and garlic in a food processor until a paste forms. Heat the oil in a small pot or saucepan. Gently fry the ginger and garlic until aromatic and just lightly caramelized. You want it to be just cooked so that it no longer has that spicy raw flavor of uncooked ginger and garlic. Add salt to taste and transfer to a sauce dish.
To Make Sauce 2: Sweet Dark Soy Sauce
Heat the water and sugar in a small saucepan over medium heat. Stir constantly until the sugar dissolves and the liquid thickens into a simple syrup. Add the dark soy sauce, stirring to combine. Transfer to a sauce dish.
To Make Sauce 3: Chili Sauce
Grind the chilies, ginger, and garlic in a food processor until finely chopped. You will probably have to scrape down the sides of the food processor 1-2 times to ensure everything is ground up evenly. Add the sesame oil, salt, sugar, lime juice, and vinegar to the food processor. Pulse 2-3 times to combine.
Transfer to a small bowl and add chicken broth (what you used to boil the chicken) 1 tablespoon at a time until a saucy consistency is achieved. This is really about your preference too; if you like a thicker paste, add less broth. The broth also helps the sauce come together and adds additional chicken flavor!",en-US,4.91,,The Woks of Life,155,6 serving(s),1 serving,722 kcal,90 g,32 g,25 g,6 g,82 mg,,10 g,2 g,,

You can discard the giblets or place them in the pot with the duck if you like. Pat the duck dry with a paper towel. Combine the salt, white pepper, and ginger in a small bowl, and rub the spice mix evenly all over the duck, both outside and inside the cavity. Set aside to marinate for 30 minutes.
Heat 1½ tablespoons canola oil in a large Dutch oven (or other oven-safe pot with a lid) over medium-high heat. Sear the duck on both sides until lightly browned and transfer the duck to a plate. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Add the garlic, shallots, and onions to the pot where you seared the duck. Fry for 3-5 minutes, until softened.
Use your hands or a fork to smash the salted plums, and add them to the pot. The plums should be pitted, but it is also okay to just add the pits and pick them out before serving. Also stir in the plum sauce, chicken stock, dried citrus peels, and vinegar. Mix well over medium heat and bring to a simmer. Once simmering, remove from the heat.
Spoon one cup of the onion mixture into the duck cavity, using a spoon to coat the inside of the duck as best as possible. Spread some of the sauce over the outside of the duck so it is lightly coated. With the onion mixture that's left in the pot, spread it out evenly across the bottom of the pot and carefully place the duck on top (breast side down). Cover the pot and place into the preheated oven for 60 minutes.
Take the pot out of the oven, and using a large roasting fork, carefully lift the duck up to dump the onions and liquid out of the cavity. Then carefully flip the duck so the breast is facing up. There should still be plenty of liquid at the bottom of the pan, but feel free to add a bit of chicken stock if it's looking dry.
Cover and return to the oven for another 30 to 60 minutes depending upon how tender you like your duck. Check the duck after 30 minutes for tenderness and add more stock if the sauce is drying out. Once you are satisfied with the tenderness, cook for another 15 minutes uncovered. Again, if there is no sauce, add in more chicken stock. Transfer the pot from the oven to the stovetop, and carefully transfer the duck to a serving plate or cutting board for carving.
Stir the sauce, discarding the tangerine peels and plum pits. If all went well, the sauce should have turned into a beautiful onion marmalade. Reduce the sauce over the stovetop if it is too thin, or add chicken stock to deglaze if the sauce is too dry.
Spoon some of the sauce and onions over the top of the duck, and serve the rest of the sauce on the side.",en-US,4.5,,The Woks of Life,200,6 serving(s),1 serving,765 kcal,50 g,18 g,55 g,17 g,97 mg,901 mg,11 g,3 g,,

One trick for the noodles is to soak the whole bag (unopened) in hot water, which speeds up the warming process without making the noodles soggy.
If you can’t find lo mein noodles, you can actually substitute dried linguini. Just cook until al dente, drain, and immediately toss with 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil, working the oil into the pasta so the noodles don't stick together. Always prepare your noodles just before you are ready to make the dish, so they don’t dry out and remain at room temperature or warmer. This makes the stir-frying process much easier.
Combine the sugar, soy sauces, oyster sauce, sesame oil, and white pepper in a bowl until the sugar is dissolved and set aside. Heat a large wok over high heat until it just starts to smoke, and add 1 tablespoon of oil around the perimeter of the wok. Quickly spread the shrimp around your wok and let them sear for 10-15 seconds on each side. Immediately transfer the shrimp to a plate and set aside.
Return the wok to the highest heat possible and add 2 tablespoons oil, along with the garlic. After a few seconds, add the mushrooms, carrots, bamboo shoots, and water chestnuts and stir-fry for 30 seconds.
Next, spread the Shaoxing wine around the perimeter of the wok, and then add the napa cabbage. Stir-fry for another 30 seconds. Spread the noodles evenly over the vegetables and give everything a good stir for 1 minute. Now, you can see why you want everything at room temperature, or everything will be overcooked and mushy by the time it heats up!
At this point, the noodles should be softened, so add in the sauce mixture you set aside earlier and mix until everything is well combined. Stir-fry for another 30 seconds using a scooping motion, until the sauce is well distributed. Add in the shrimp, snow peas, bean sprouts, and scallions.

After cleaning, cut off the tough bottom portion of the lily flowers. Cut off the mushroom stems as well, which will speed up the soaking process.
Transfer the wood ears, lily flowers, and mushrooms to three separate bowls filled with water, and soak for one to two hours. Use a plate to cover and press each of the dried ingredients down to ensure they are fully rehydrated.
Once reconstituted, roughly chop the wood ears. Squeeze some of the excess water from the mushrooms, and slice each one into quarter-inch thick slices. Be sure to squeeze the lily flowers dry as well.

When you’re ready to cook the dish, let the chicken mixture come up to room temperature, and add the cornstarch until it is uniformly incorporated. At this point, all of the liquid should be absorbed into the chicken, and there should be little or no standing liquid.

Add the chicken to a large mixing bowl along with the salt, white pepper, ginger, sesame oil, and 2 tablespoons of water. Mix thoroughly and set aside for 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, make the coating. In a shallow bowl, combine the potato starch and panko. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of water over the top, and mix with your hands. This creates some clumps in the dry mix to give more texture to the coating.
Toss the chicken in the marinade once more to ensure the pieces are evenly moist. Dredge chicken pieces until they’re completely coated.
Fry the chicken for the first time:
Heat 4-5 cups of oil in a deep pot to 325°F/163°C. The oil should ideally fill the pot about halfway, so hot oil won’t overflow or splatter too much while frying.
Fry the chicken in batches until lightly golden, 2-3 mins for nuggets, 3-4 mins for tenders, 6-8 mins for whole wings, 4-6 mins for drumettes and flats, and 9-11 mins for drumsticks or bone-in thighs. Drain on a cooling rack placed over a sheet pan, and between batches, remove any particles left in the oil using a strainer.
Make the glaze:
In a saucepan over medium low heat, add 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, along with the shallot, garlic, and dried chili peppers (if using, for optional spice). Cook for 3-4 minutes, stirring occasionally, or until the shallots are translucent. If using the dried chili peppers, you can de-seed them and chop them, or simply chop and include the seeds for an extra spicy kick. If you’d like to keep your sauce more mild, omit them entirely.
Next, add the soy sauce, water, mirin, rice vinegar, light brown sugar, gochujang, and dijon mustard.
Stir and bring the sauce to a simmer, stirring continuously (4-5 minutes). When the sauce has come to a simmer, remove from the heat, cover, and set aside to keep warm.
Re-fry chicken and toss in sauce:
For the second and final fry, bring the oil temperature up to 375°F/190°C. Fry the chicken in batches—1 minute for bone-in pieces and 30 seconds for boneless pieces. Drain on a cooling rack.
Once you’ve fried all the chicken for the second time, add it to a large bowl, and pour the sauce over the top. Toss the chicken in the sauce until the pieces are well-coated.

Let cool. if you're short on time, you can also start by boiling the brine with just 2 quarts of water and then adding ice to cool to 1 gallon of brine.
While that's happening, rinse your turkey legs and set aside in a large container (one that will fit into your refrigerator). You may want to use two separate containers. When the brine has cooled, pour the brine over the turkey legs, making sure they are totally submerged. Cover and refrigerate overnight.
If you want to expedite the process, use a marinade injector, injecting one syringe-full of brine into each turkey leg (1½ syringe-fulls for the larger turkey legs). Then, let brine as usual for 5-6 hours. This way, the turkey legs don't need to brine overnight. Sounds gruesome, but it really expedites the process, and these marinade injectors are pretty inexpensive!
When the turkey legs are ready, heat your charcoal. Your key tools for this recipe are a charcoal grill, a chimney starter, charcoal, and wet wood chips, which provides the smoky flavor. Fill your chimney with charcoal and light the coals with a piece of newspaper. Let heat for a solid 15-20 minutes or so--until the coals are slightly white hot. Also, take 1-2 handfuls of wood chips and soak them in water while the coals are heating.
Pour the coals into the grill and scatter the wood chips around the coals. Lay your grill rack over the coals. Place the turkey legs on the grill rack and close the grill.
chimney-full of coal is enough to start for an average-sized charcoal grill. Add another chimney of coal every 20-30 minutes, depending on the kind of charcoal you're using. Periodically add additional wet wood chips to make more smoke as needed. More wood chips makes more smoke, increasing the ""hammy"" smoked flavor of the turkey legs. You can cater this to your personal preferences. I like a very hammy smoked turkey leg; my aunt prefers more of a natural flavor. Take your pick!
The slow cooking method is key here. Periodically check the turkey legs, turning every once in a while, and make sure the grill maintains a temperature of 300-325 degrees. There is some element of trial and error to this if you're a first-timer; make observations and adjust amounts of charcoal, wood chips, and heat over the course of the cooking time.
Maintain the grill, charcoal, and wood chips, letting the turkey cook for 3 ½ to 4 hours--until the turkey legs have a nice, dark smoky color that a young Chinese girl once thought only existed within the walls of Disney World.

Clean the chicken by rinsing it under cold water, paying special attention to the cavity. Any giblets should already be removed but there may still be organs on the inside that should be removed or sometimes stray feathers that need to be plucked. Experts recommend that it's not necessary to wash your chicken before cutting and cooking but in this case for a whole chicken (especially if you get it from a live poultry place or even from Asian markets), it's a step that shouldn't be skipped, in my opinion. When washing and prepping the whole chicken, be very careful about splashing water and contaminating surfaces with unwanted bacteria. Be careful not to break or trim away any of the skin on the chicken, as you don’t want the meat exposed to the boiling water as it cooks. This will ensure a moist, silky texture in the final product.
Fill a large stock pot with water, just enough to submerge the chicken completely. You can determine this by putting the entire chicken in the pot, filling it with water until the chicken is submerged, and then removing the chicken. Do not turn on the heat while the chicken is still in the pot! This method of ensuring you have just enough water to submerge the chicken (and avoiding any extra) will ensure you have a more flavorful stock to save at the end. We used about 18 cups of water to submerge a 4 pound chicken in a deep stock pot.
Once you have your water properly measured into the pot, add 2 scallions and 5 slices of ginger, and bring it to a boil. Once boiling, slowly lower the chicken into the pot, legs down and head up. It’s ok if the breast is peeking out of the water a bit. The water will cool down and stop boiling when you add the chicken, so bring it up to a boil once again, and do not walk away from the pot.
Once the water boils again, IMMEDIATELY lift the chicken out of the water very carefully. You can carefully hook two wooden spoons under the wings to lift the chicken up. The goal is to empty any colder water that may be trapped inside the cavity. Once you’ve released that water, lower the chicken back into the pot, and bring to a boil again.
When the water is JUST starting to boil, turn the heat down. Keep it at barely a simmer. There should be very little movement in the water, but it also shouldn’t be still. Cover the pot, and keep the heat around the lowest setting so the liquid continues to simmer slowly. Cook for about 35-40 minutes, roughly 10-11 minutes per pound. Depending on the size of your chicken, it may take more or less time to cook it through. You can check to make sure the water is bubbling slowly/gently and not boiling too vigorously, but try to avoid uncovering the pot while it’s cooking.
Poke a chopstick or skewer into the thigh to check for doneness. If the juices run clear, it's done. Carefully lift the chicken out of the pot and transfer it to a large bowl of ice water. Cool completely.
While the chicken is cooling, make the sauce. You have the option to make two versions—one with just scallions, ginger, oil and salt, and one with soy sauce. The plain version is more traditional, as it really lets the flavors of chicken, ginger, and scallion shine through. Judy loves to add soy sauce, and it’s also a tasty option! Start with the plain version, and then scoop some of it out into another bowl and add soy sauce. Try both and see which your loved ones like best!
When the chicken is out of the ice water, you can brush it lightly with oil or some of the fat floating atop the poaching liquid to give it that enticing, shiny look!

You'll want it at room temperature when it hits the pot. Remove the giblets, and thoroughly rinse the chicken inside and out.
Grab your stock pot. It will ideally be a tall, narrow pot that will just fit the chicken, since it should be totally submerged in the cooking liquid (if you use a larger pot, you'll need to increase all the ingredients proportionally to create more cooking liquid). Put it over medium low heat, and add the oil and ginger.
Let the ginger caramelize for about 30 seconds. Then add the scallions and cook another 30 seconds. Add the star anise and wine (you can use Shaoxing rice wine, rose wine or a mix of both), and bring to a simmer to let some of the alcohol cook off. Add the soy sauce, dark soy sauce, sugar, salt, and water. Bring to a simmer again and cook on low heat for another 20 minutes.
Increase the heat to bring the liquid to a slow boil (i.e. a little stronger than a simmer, but not a rolling boil). Use a large roasting fork inserted into the chicken cavity to lower the chicken slowly into the pot breast side up. Make sure any air pockets in the cavity fill up completely with liquid. The chicken should be entirely submerged at this point.
Once the chicken goes in, the cooking liquid will cool down. Let it cook for about 5 minutes at medium high heat. Next, use your large fork to carefully lift the chicken out of the water and empty the liquid inside the cavity, which will be cooler than the liquid surrounding the chicken. Lower the chicken back into the pot, making sure once again that there aren't any air pockets in the cavity. If the chicken is not completely submerged, periodically baste the exposed area with cooking liquid.
Bring the liquid back up to a lazy simmer, which should take about 10 minutes. Keep it at this slow simmer (the liquid will be about 210 degrees F) for 25 minutes. Turn off the heat, cover the pot, and let the chicken sit in the pot for another 15 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a cutting board. If you like, you can use a meat thermometer in the thickest part of the thigh to confirm it's reached 165 degrees F.
Use the sauce from the pot to occasionally baste the chicken and keep the skin moist as it cools. Serve over rice with some sauce from the pot!
Note: You can also make this recipe with chicken leg quarters and reduce the cooking time accordingly, since they are easier to handle and faster to cook. Also, once you're done cooking the chicken, you can actually freeze the sauce/cooking liquid for use again later (though you may have to re-season the sauce).",en-US,4.92,,The Woks of Life,105,6 serving(s),1 serving,371 kcal,8 g,28 g,23 g,6 g,109 mg,770 mg,7 g,1 g,,

Note: If this sounds too spicy for you, you can add chili oil to taste rather than the entire amount called for.
Stir-fry everything to combine—at this point, it's a glistening, spicy, delicious party. The sauces should combine nicely and the cornstarch from the chicken marinade should thicken the sauce slightly. Add a tablespoon of chicken stock if the sauce is too thick.

Place the chicken on the cutting board. Cut off the neck where it meets the body of the chicken, and cut off the head (if attached). Put on one side of the platter. This is decorative and symbolic, but you can simply discard it if you prefer. Set the neck aside.
Step 2: Remove and trim the chicken feet.
Cut off the feet at the joint where the drumstick ends. If you have chicken feet lovers, trim off the nails and place them on the platter, alongside the head if you have it. Elders love chicken feet, but if you have no takers, save it for chicken stock.
Step 3: Split the chicken in half.
With the chicken breast-side up, split it in half. When your knife pushes through to the back of the chicken, cut one half off of the side of the backbone, cutting straight through the length of the chicken, leaving the tail intact.
Next, cut the middle backbone lengthwise up through the neck, and you’ll have three pieces, as shown. Two halves, and the backbone with the tail on one end and the neck on the other. If you prefer, you can use sharp kitchen shears instead of a cleaver for this step.
Step 4: Trim the neck, back bone, and tail pieces.
I usually cut the neck pieces and backbone, place them in the middle of the plate, and pile the nicer pieces of the chicken on top, with the tail at the side of the platter opposite the head. You can also save all these pieces for chicken stock instead.
Step 5: Separate the thighs and drumsticks.
Next, take one of the chicken halves, and make a cut in the skin attaching the thigh to the breast. Fold the thigh and drumstick backwards, and it will almost separate itself. Use the cleaver to cut through the cartilage that attaches the thigh to the body.
Separate the drumstick and the thigh by cutting through the cartilage at the joint. If you have a small family or young kids, you may want to leave the whole drumsticks intact on the serving plate. Otherwise use some solid strokes with the cleaver to cut each drumstick into halves on a slight angle/diagonal. Do the same to cut the thighs into ¾-inch pieces.
Keep the cut thigh and drumstick pieces together, and place them on the lower end of the plate
Step 5: Cut the wings.
Next, cut off both whole wings at the joint where the drumette meets the body of the chicken. Next, cut each wing into three pieces: the flat, the drumette, and the wing tip. Place the pieces on one side near the top of the plate where the head is.
Step 6: Cut the breast.
Make a lengthwise cut to separate the rib from the breast, and cut each into 3/4-inch wide pieces. Keep the pieces together as best you can, lifting them off the cutting board with your cleaver and onto the plate.",en-US,5.0,,The Woks of Life,10,6 serving(s),,,,,,,,,,,,

Add the oil, soy sauce, and cornstarch, and mix until well combined. Set aside for 20 minutes.
Next, wash the mung bean sprouts in a large bowl of cold water, leaving the bean sprouts in the water for two to three minutes so they are rehydrated. This step not only washes the sprouts but also allows them to absorb some of that cold water to regain their freshness and crunch. Transfer them to a colander, setting them over a bowl or the sink to let the excess water drain completely. The root portion of the bean sprout can be a bit stringy and unpleasant, and some folks do pinch it off--but a word of caution that it is a lot of work, so we usually settle for a good couple of rinses in cold water.
Finally, prepare the other ingredients--namely the scallions, garlic, and mushrooms. Cooking this dish quickly is really important, so your bean sprouts don’t turn to mush. If you’re not great adding quick measurements of spices, oils, and sauces, it’s best if you have all of those ingredients prepped and measured in advance, in addition to the fresh ingredients.
Heat your wok on high heat until it just starts to smoke, and spread 2 tablespoons of oil around the perimeter of the wok. Add the chicken, and use your spatula to spread the meat evenly across the wok. Sear for another 20 seconds (i.e., without mixing the chicken around), stir fry for another 20 seconds, and transfer the chicken to a bowl.
Add another tablespoon of oil to the wok, along with the mushrooms and the white portions of the scallions. Stir fry for 10 seconds, and add the garlic. You should have the wok at the highest heat you can muster at this point!
Next, add the mung bean sprouts and stir fry everything together. Spread the Shaoxing wine around the perimeter of the wok, and give everything another quick stir. Then add the oyster sauce, salt, sesame oil, white pepper, and MSG, if using.

On the day before you plan to roast it, make the marinade by combining the garlic, salt, soy sauces, wine, sugar, white pepper, five spice powder, sand ginger powder, and sesame oil in the food processor. Pulse until you can’t see any more big chunks of garlic in the mixture.
Spread out the onion wedges in the bottom of your roasting pan. The onions will serve as the “rack” that the turkey will sit on.
Remove the turkey from the package. Remove the neck and the giblets from the turkey cavity and give the bird a good rinse with cold water. Pat it thoroughly dry with paper towels, and lay it breast side down in the pan. Spread half of your marinade all over the bottom side of the turkey, making sure you cover every surface and crevice (including the cavity). Flip the bird over so it's laying breast side up, and spread the other half of the marinade over this side of the turkey. Also spread some of the marinade on the neck and giblets, and add those to the pan as well.
Cover the roasting pan tightly with plastic and allow the turkey to marinate breast side up overnight.
The next day, allow the turkey to sit out on the counter at room temperature for about 2-4 hours to warm up (you don’t want to transfer the turkey directly from the refrigerator to the oven, which may result in uneven cooking). Tie the legs together with kitchen string.
4 hours before you plan to serve the turkey, preheat the oven to 425 degrees F and arrange a rack in the lower third of the oven. Flip the turkey breast side down, and place in the middle of the oven. Roast for 30 minutes. Baste the turkey with any pan drippings, and then rotate the roasting pan 180 degrees so that the turkey cooks evenly. Roast for another 30 minutes.
By now, your turkey has been roasting at 425 degrees F for 1 hour. Turn the heat down to 325 degrees F, and flip the turkey breast side up. Baste the turkey with the pan drippings, brushing off any onions or other bits that may be stuck to the breast. If the roasting pan is dry, add ½ cup of water to prevent the onions or the pan drippings from burning.
Roast the turkey for another 75-90 minutes, basting once or twice, until a meat thermometer inserted into the thigh reads 165-170 degrees F and any juices run clear (not pink). During this time, twist the turkey pan 180 degrees if the turkey is cooking unevenly (ovens vary and some do tend to have hot spots). If the top of the turkey starts to get too dark, place a large piece of foil loosely over the top of the turkey to protect it from burning.
Remove the turkey from the oven and let it rest for 15 minutes, covered loosely with foil. After this initial resting time, transfer the turkey to a cutting board or serving plate, keeping it tented with the foil.
Using a slotted spoon, remove any burnt bits or impurities from the roasting pan. Next, scoop out the onions and giblets, and transfer to a blender. If you don’t like giblets, you can alternatively shred the neck meat and add that to the blender, but this is totally optional if you want to serve the neck along with the turkey instead! Pour the remaining pan juices and fat into a large gravy separator and set aside.
It’s time to make the gravy. Blend the onions and giblets (or neck meat, if using) until smooth. In a saucepan over medium heat, add the turkey fat. You should have about a quarter cup of fat. If not, add enough butter to approximate ¼ cup of fat.
Whisk in ¼ cup all purpose flour to form a roux, and cook for about 3 minutes, whisking constantly. Turn the heat down if necessary to prevent burning.
Whisk in the paprika, the contents of the blender, and the juices from the roasting pan. Gravy isn’t an exact science––you’ll have to adjust according to how thick or thin you like your gravy! If the gravy still looks too thick, add more chicken stock until it reaches your desired consistency. Continue to simmer the gravy for about 2 minutes, whisking constantly.
At this point, add the dark soy sauce. This ingredient is mostly for color––I add as much as I need to get the rich color I’m looking for. Season the gravy with salt and pepper to taste.
By now, your turkey should be fully rested. Carve the turkey and serve with the gravy on the side.",en-US,4.5,,The Woks of Life,870,12 serving(s),1 serving,622 kcal,10 g,85 g,25 g,8 g,297 mg,,3 g,1 g,,

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and place the duck on a foil lined sheet pan. Roast the duck for about 45 minutes and finish under the broiler to crisp the skin a bit. Once cooled, take the meat off the bone and shred it with a fork or just with your hands. Put about a tablespoon of hot water on the roasting pan and use a rubber spatula to deglaze it.

On a sheet pan, drizzle the chicken breasts with olive oil and sprinkle liberally with salt and black pepper.
Bake in the oven for 35-40 minutes. When the chicken breasts are done cooking, take them out of the oven to cool, and remove the meat from the bone, cutting the chicken into large chunks. You can save these bones for a small batch of stock or plan to cook the chicken further in advance so you can use the stock for the pot pie filling. If you decide to do the latter, simmer the bones in about 5 cups of water for a few hours.
While the chicken is cooking, prepare the pastry. Mix the flour, salt, and baking powder in the bowl of your food processor. Add the shortening and butter and pulse about 10 times, until the butter and shortening are the size of small peas.
With the food processor on, add the ice water--just enough for the dough to just come together. You may have to pause and give it a stir with your hands, as some portions of the dough will be wetter or dryer. Dump the dough onto a clean, floured surface and knead gently into a ball. No need to overwork the dough! Wrap it in plastic and transfer to the refrigerator to rest for 30 minutes.
Now, back to the filling. In a heavy-bottomed pot, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and onions, and cook until translucent. Next, add the carrots and cook for another 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Next, add the bell pepper and cook for about 3 minutes.
Add the butter, stirring to help it melt, and allowing the vegetables to cook further. When the butter is completely melted, turn down the heat to low, and add in ¾ cup of flour. Stir the flour and vegetable mixture constantly for 2 minutes.
Add the chicken stock, stirring thoroughly and breaking up lumps. Turn the heat back up to medium-high, so the sauce thickens and bubbles. When the sauce has a gravy-like consistency, add the frozen peas and diced chicken breast, followed by the heavy cream, parsley, and thyme. Simmer for an additional 5 minutes, and remove from the heat.
Now, to assemble your pot pies! Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Choose your oven-safe vessels and fill with the chicken pot pie filling, leaving about an inch of clearance between the top line of the filling and the baking dish. I made one large casserole, and 3 smaller ones, so I cut my dough into 4 proportional pieces. No need for this to become an exact science! Roll the dough out on a clean, floured surface.

Keep the bones to make a homemade stock, which you’ll be using in this recipe. You might be able to ask your butcher to help you with this step!
In a small pot, add your reserved chicken bones, 2 ½ cups water, and ginger. Bring to a boil and simmer over low heat for at least 1 hour (or longer). We’ll need 1 ½ cups of chicken broth for the recipe. You can also eliminate this step if you want to use store-bought chicken stock.
Rinse off your de-boned chicken and pat thoroughly dry with a paper towel. Grab 2 pieces of aluminum foil, each about 12” long. Lay each piece of chicken onto a piece of foil, and sprinkle with ¼ teaspoon salt. Roll up the chicken lengthwise, and then wrap in the foil, twisting both sides to form a candy-like bundle.
Steam the chicken in the foil over high heat for 20 minutes, covered. Turn off the heat and let the chicken sit in the steamer for another 5 minutes with the lid tightly closed.
Transfer the foil wrapped chicken to an ice bath, and let it sit there for 10-15 minutes, until the chicken is completely cool. This step ensures that the juices remain locked in and improves the chicken’s overall texture.
Now it’s time to make the brine. In a non-reactive container (I used a glass loaf pan. Anything narrow and deep, where the chicken can remain submerged, will work), add the 1 ½ cups chicken broth, 1 ½ cups shaoxing wine, sugar, salt, and goji berries. Once the chicken is cool, unwrap the chicken and place in the brine. Cover and refrigerate for 24 hours.v
Slice and serve cold or at room temperature. This dish is usually served as a cold appetizer. Remember to store the chicken in the brine until serving and use clean utensil whenever coming contact with the brine and chicken. Consume the chicken within 3 days.

Use tongs or chopsticks to turn the chicken quarters and let cook for another 15 minutes. There should be quite a bit of sauce in the pan, but if things are looking dry, add a bit more chicken stock.
Next, uncover the chicken and add the green portions of the scallions. Cook uncovered to reduce the liquid until it just begins to coat a spoon. Use a meat thermometer to check to make sure the internal temperature of the chicken is 165 degrees F. Alternatively, you can just poke the thickest part of the chicken leg quarter with a fork--the juice should run clear. At this point, you can be the judge of how thick or thin you want your sauce to be, but the chicken should be done. Turn the heat up to reduce the sauce if you like yours on the thicker side.
Serve the chicken, all of that luscious gravy, and the cooked down garlic, ginger, and scallions over a bed of white rice with your favorite veggies.

The next day, when you’re ready to cook your turkey, preheat your oven to 400 degrees and take the turkey out of the refrigerator to allow it to come back up to room temperature. Roast the turkey breast for about 35 minutes at 400 degrees. Baste the turkey in the pan juices, and add half a cup of water or chicken stock to the roasting pan if it looks dry.
Tent the breast with a piece of foil so it does not burn, and turn the temperature down to 350 degrees. Bake for another 40 minutes, or until a meat thermometer reads 160-165 degrees, and remove from the oven. Transfer the turkey breast to a cutting board to rest, leaving it covered in foil.
Now for the stuffing. Using a slotted spoon, carefully remove any congealed blood from the turkey pan and discard it. Yes, tis the reality of cooking meat! You can do this. Pour off any juices in the roasting pan into a fat separator (if your fat separator has one of those strainer attachments, you may be able to skip the skimming step). In short, you should only have the cooked carrots, celery, and onion in the roasting pan. Place it directly on the stove top over low to medium heat.
Stir the 1½ tablespoons of butter into the roasted vegetables along with the dried dill. Then add 1½ cups of the chicken stock/turkey drippings mixture to deglaze the pan.
Next, add the bread cubes to the pan, and toss the mixture until the bread soaks up all of the liquid. Cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. The stuffing may begin to stick to the bottom of the pan, so add the rest of your turkey drippings/chicken stock mixture to deglaze the pan again, followed by the fresh sage, flat-leaf parsley, thyme, and oregano. Season with salt and pepper to taste, and stir everything together until combined. Use a metal spatula to scrape the bottom of the pan so it does not stick and burn. Cook for another 5 minutes, and remove from the heat. Cover with foil until you are ready to serve.
Now it's time to make the gravy. Pour the turkey fat/olive oil mixture (it will likely be mostly olive oil, as a turkey breast doesn't yield a ton of fat) into a saucepan along with 1 tablespoon of butter. Heat over medium heat, and whisk in 1/3 cup of flour until all the flour is absorbed (about 1 minute) and creates a roux. Stir in the paprika and fresh ground black pepper and then gradually whisk in your turkey drippings and chicken stock mixture to form the gravy. Keep stirring until the gravy has a uniform consistency. Add one teaspoon of soy sauce and salt to taste. Next, whisk in the cornstarch mixture and let simmer for 30 seconds.",en-US,5.0,,The Woks of Life,90,8 serving(s),1 serving,605 kcal,24 g,80 g,22 g,6 g,200 mg,2066 mg,6 g,3 g,,

If using a food processor, tear the leaves up and pulse them into small pieces (take care not to mince the napa cabbage). If hand-chopping them, slice the leaves thinly lengthwise and then finely chop them going the other way. Transfer to a bowl and mix in ¾ teaspoon salt. Set aside for 30 minutes while you prepare the other ingredients (but no more than 30 minutes). After 30 minutes, squeeze the napa cabbage dry and save the water.
Pre-soak the mushrooms if using dried shiitake mushrooms (then squeeze any water from the mushrooms and reserve the soaking liquid––if using fresh mushrooms, skip this step). Remove the mushroom stems and dice them into ½” cubes.
Heat 3 tablespoons oil in a wok or pan over medium high heat, and cook the mushrooms for about 5-8 minutes until caramelized. Turn off the heat and leave the mushrooms to cool.
Now hand-chop the chicken by using our method for grinding meat without a grinder. This allows you to choose whatever cut of chicken you like (breast or thighs) and get a better texture than conventional ground meat. If you’d like to skip this step, you can also use ground chicken.
Time to make the filling: combine the chicken, napa cabbage, cooked mushrooms (with any oil left in the pan), ginger, scallions, light soy sauce, Shaoxing wine, oyster sauce, sesame oil, sugar, white pepper, Knorr Chicken Powder, and 2 tablespoons of liquid from either soaking the mushrooms or salting the cabbage (if you have neither, just use water).
Using a rubber spatula or pair of chopsticks, stir the mixture in one direction for 10 minutes, longer if needed, until the filling is well combined and sticky, like a paste.
Prepare a large sheet pan lined with parchment paper and get a small bowl of room temperature water. Lastly, bring a small pot of water to a boil, so you can taste­ test a couple wontons.
To assemble the wontons, take your square wonton wrapper, wet your finger, and dab one side of the square with water. Add 1-2 teaspoons of filling in the center, and gently fold the wrapper in half. Seal on all sides. Using your finger, brush another dab of water on one corner (of the filling side), and gently overlap the two corners of the rectangle by pressing them together. Place on the parchment-­lined sheet pan.
Make one more wonton, boil, and taste test the two samples (we find that tasting two, and not just one, helps us get a better feel for the flavor and adjust seasoning more accurately). Make adjustments to taste before proceeding to make the whole batch.
To cook the wontons, boil water in a pot, and add the wontons (fresh or frozen, but never defrosted wontons). To prevent the wontons from sticking to the bottom of the pot, stir the boiling water gently so the water is moving when you add in the wontons. Cook uncovered for abou 5 minutes using medium heat. If necessary, add ½ cup cold water if the water is boiling too vigorously. This helps manage the starch levels in the water. The wontons are done once they float to the surface and turn slightly plump.

Place the wings on the grill, topside down. After about 3-5 minutes, you can turn them 90 degrees to brown them evenly. Close the grill to let them cook through as well. Though you should only close the grill for 45-60 seconds at a time, as grease flare-ups can occur pretty easily with wings. When the top of the wing is thoroughly grilled (you'll know it by the golden, lightly crisped and charred skin), flip the wings. Lower the heat to medium/medium high, and repeat these steps until the wings are cooked through, periodically closing the grill to let them cook through.

Mix the salt, soy sauce, wine, and five spice powder in a small bowl and massage into the duck. Leave the duck breasts skin side up on a plate uncovered, and let sit in the refrigerator overnight to marinate and to let the skin dry out. (If you don't want to wait overnight, reduce the marinating time to 30 minutes).
Prepare mandarin pancakes:
Mix the flour and salt in a heatproof bowl. Pour the boiling hot water into the flour mixture and use chopsticks or a spatula to mix until a dough ball forms. Once it is cool enough to handle, knead the dough for 8 minutes until smooth, adding flour if the dough is too sticky. Cover with plastic and allow the dough to rest at room temperature for at least 1 hour.
Roll the dough into a cylinder and cut into 12 equal pieces. Form each piece into a dough ball, then flatten them out into a small disc about 2 inches in diameter. Lightly brush 6 of the discs with oil, ensuring the sides of the discs are also brushed with oil. Layer the remaining 6 discs over the 6 oiled discs so you have 6 pieces, each comprised of 2 discs.
Use a rolling pin to roll the discs into 7-inch circles, flipping the pancakes frequently so both of the dough discs are rolled into the same size.
Heat a wok or frying pan over medium low heat, and place one pancake into the pan. After 30 to 45 seconds, you should see air pockets begin to form between the two pancakes. Flip the pancake; it should be white with just a couple of faint brown patches. Any more than that, and they are overcooked. After another 30 seconds, the air pockets should be large enough to separate the two pancakes. Remove the pancake to a plate, and let it cool for another 30 seconds. Now carefully pull apart the two pancakes at the seams. Place finished pancakes onto a plate and cover with a warm kitchen towel. Repeat until all pancakes are done.
The pancakes can be reheated in a steamer for about a minute when ready to serve. They also keep in the freezer for up to 3 weeks if you decide to make a larger batch.
Cook the duck and assemble:
Next, preheat the oven broiler on low heat. Heat an oven-proof pan over medium-high heat, and add 1 tablespoon of oil to coat the pan.
Sear the duck breasts, skin side down, for 6-8 minutes. Move them frequently so the skin crisps up and fries in the duck fat that renders out. Turn the heat down to medium if needed.
After 6-8 minutes, or when the duck skin is a bit crispy and dark golden brown, carefully drain off the duck fat and discard (or save for later application to other recipes!). Flip the duck breasts (so they are skin side up), and transfer them to the broiler for about 3 minutes. Be careful not to burn the skin, which at this point should be a bit crispy.
Remove the duck from the broiler and let rest for 10 to 15 minutes. The duck will be cooked about medium well and will be very juicy. Transfer to a cutting board and, using a sharp knife, cut into thin slices.

Use your hands to tear the green vegetables lengthwise into manageable pieces and set aside.
Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the fresh or dried noodles. For fresh noodles, boil for 30 seconds to a minute. For dried, it’ll take a little longer. Cook until they’re just softened. Be careful not to overcook them, or they’ll be soggy! Rinse with cold water, drain, and set aside.
In a small bowl, combine the oyster sauce, soy sauce, sesame oil, sugar, salt, white pepper, and hot chicken stock. In another bowl, mix the 2 tablespoons of cornstarch and 2 tablespoons water into a slurry and set aside. To go over what you’ve prepared so far: the marinated chicken, the washed and trimmed veggies, the cooked noodles, the sauce mix, and the cornstarch slurry. I know it seems like a lot of prep, but the dish really does come together quickly!
Heat your wok over high heat and add 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, making sure to swirl it around to coat the sides. Spread out your noodles in an even layer and fry for about 3 minutes, or until golden and crisp. Flip the noodles over and fry the other side (you can add a bit more oil if necessary). If preheated properly, the noodles should not stick to the wok. With practice, you’ll be able to flip all the noodles in one shot! If you’re not feeling lucky, then just flip it in small sections. When the noodles are golden on both sides, transfer the noodles to a large round plate.
Next, heat the wok until just smoking and add another tablespoon of vegetable oil. Sear the chicken breast. Once browned, add the garlic and then the Shaoxing wine to deglaze the pan. Pour in your sauce. Now you get why I said hot chicken stock, since I doubt you have a 50 thousand BTU roaring flame beneath your wok! Our dinky little Beijing flame isn’t the best either. Let the liquid come to a boil and add your green vegetables. Stir and cook for about a minute.
Stir up your slurry mixture again, since the cornstarch probably settled to the bottom of the bowl. Once the liquid is boiling, add about 2/3 of the cornstarch and stir the mixture to thicken. Add more slurry until the sauce thickens enough to coat a spoon. How thick you like your sauce it is also about personal preference. Allow to bubble up for another 30 seconds or so.
Pour the entire mixture over the noodles and serve immediately. Serve with hot chili oil or Sriracha on the side if you like!",en-US,4.83,,The Woks of Life,50,4 serving(s),1 serving,443 kcal,49 g,21 g,16 g,2 g,65 mg,1349 mg,3 g,1 g,,

You can butterfly or spatchcock your chicken for grilling like it’s done on the streets of Thailand. However, I cut the chicken into individual pieces to ensure they’d cook properly.

In a small bowl, mix the sugar and hot water until the sugar is dissolved. Mix in the rest of the sauce ingredients and set aside.
Cook the chicken:
Place the chicken on the grill, and use any remaining marinade to baste the chicken while grilling. Leave the marinade paste on the chicken, including any chunks of herbs as they will caramelize and add flavor. Turn and baste the chicken often to create a nice flavorful outer crust. Baste the chicken with the leftover marinade in the first half of the grilling process, but do not do this towards the end of cooking. The raw chicken marinade needs enough time to fully cook.

While the duck is marinating, you can prepare your spice pouch. Place the star anise, cumin seeds, bay leaves, cinnamon, and peppercorns on a square of cheesecloth and tie tightly with kitchen twine. Set aside.
Next, prepare a pot that is big enough to cook the duck whole. Fill it with 12-15 cups of water, enough to submerge the whole duck. Add the spice pouch along with the ginger and scallion. Bring the pot of water to a boil, and add the Shaoxing wine. Simmer over low heat.

Starting with a partially frozen bird is majorly bad juju.
Get your goose ready for roasting by removing the giblets and neck from the cavity. Use a sharp knife to trim any large pads of fat from the inside. Give the goose a really thorough rinse (including the cavity), and pat dry. Do not remove the flap of skin at the neck, just tuck it underneath the goose to keep it sealed.
If the goose is trussed, remove the string and pull out the legs and wings slightly, which will help with more even cooking. Place the goose in a foil-lined roasting pan. You definitely want there to be a sizeable rim around the pan, as the goose will release a lot of fat as it cooks.
Zest the oranges and mix the zest with 1½ teaspoons salt, pepper, sugar, five spice powder, shaoxing wine (or sherry), and soy sauce. Set aside.
Season the goose cavity with salt, and rub the minced garlic all throughout the cavity as well. Stuff the ginger slices and scallions into the cavity, along with the zested oranges, cut into quarters.
Rub the orange zest and five-spice mixture all over the goose, and set it aside for 30 minutes (you can also marinate it overnight for optimum results). During this time, preheat your oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Place the goose in the oven and cook for 10 minutes at 450 degrees F/230 degrees C. Reduce the heat to 350 degrees F (190 degrees C) and cook for another 10-12 minutes per pound (about 1 hour and 45 minutes to 2 hours for a 10-pound goose. If your goose is larger, increase the cooking time accordingly). Feel free to adjust cooking times depending on your desired doneness, but don’t dry it out! When a meat thermometer in the thigh reads 165-170 degrees F, it’s done.
Every 30 minutes, baste the bird with the fat in the pan. About halfway through cooking, tent the breast loosely with foil and spoon out 3 tablespoons of goose fat.
Take this fat and toss it on a roasting pan with the potatoes, salt, pepper, and your choice of herbs—thyme, rosemary, whatever. Throw those into the oven with the goose in its last half hour and roast.
Once the goose is done roasting, take it out of the oven and cover with foil. Give the potatoes a stir and crank the heat up to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C) to finish roasting. Let the goose rest for 20 minutes while the potatoes finish cooking.
Carve the goose and serve with the roasted potatoes. (Note: you can keep the rendered fat in a mason jar in the fridge and save it for roasted vegetables, beans, and stews).",en-US,5.0,,The Woks of Life,165,8 serving(s),,,,,,,,,,,,

Add the shredded chicken to the scallion and onion mixture along with the chopped cilantro, lime juice, lime zest, and salt and pepper, to taste. Stir to combine.
Heat your oven to 400 degrees. Melt 4 tablespoons butter and set aside. Prepare a sheet pan with a layer of nonstick foil or parchment paper.
Take your phyllo dough and lay out one sheet on a clean surface. Brush it with a little melted butter and sprinkle lightly with breadcrumbs. Put another layer of phyllo dough on top, and repeat the butter and breadcrumb process again and again until you have 4 layers. Spoon half of the curry chicken mixture along one edge (lengthwise) of the phyllo. Roll it up tightly and set the roll seam side down on the baking sheet.
Repeat the process with the rest of the phyllo and chicken mixture to make a second roll. Brush each roll with the rest of the melted butter and score both rolls diagonally into 1 inch pieces with a serrated knife. You'll get about 8 pieces out of each roll.

1110,Sweet and Sour Chicken,Bill,https://thewoksoflife.com/sweet-and-sour-chicken/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sweet-sour-chicken-10.jpg,"['1/2 cup hot water ((120 ml))', '1/4 teaspoon salt', '2 tablespoons sugar ((25g))', '1 tablespoon ketchup', '1/2 cup pineapple juice ((120 ml; optional, reserved from canned pineapple))', '3 tablespoons rice wine vinegar ((45 ml, or red wine vinegar))', '12 ounces boneless skinless chicken breast or thighs ((350g))', '1-2 tablespoons water', '1/8 teaspoon garlic powder', '1/4 teaspoon onion powder', '1/2 teaspoon sesame oil', '1/8 teaspoon white pepper', '1/2 teaspoon salt', '3/4 cup all purpose flour ((100g))', '1 tablespoon cornstarch', '3/4 teaspoon baking powder', '3/4 teaspoon baking soda', '2/3 cup ice water ((160 ml))', '1 tablespoon vegetable oil ((or canola oil, plus more for frying))', '2/3 cup canned pineapple chunks ((optional))', '1 tablespoon oil', '1/4 cup red onion ((cut into 1-inch chunks))', '1/4 cup red bell pepper ((cut into 1-inch chunks))', '1/4 cup green bell pepper ((cut into 1-inch chunks))', '2 tablespoons cornstarch ((mixed with 2 tablespoons water))']","Start by preparing the sauce:
Set aside ½ cup of pineapple juice from your can of pineapple, and reserve ⅔ cup of the pineapple chunks (if using). Set aside.
Combine the hot water, salt, sugar, and ketchup. Stir until the salt and sugar are dissolved, and then add the vinegar and pineapple juice (if using). If not using pineapple juice, replace with ½ cup water or chicken stock. Set aside.
Marinate the chicken:
Experts are recommending that it's not necessary to wash your chicken before cutting and cooking it (thanks to Judy, one of our readers for pointing this out). If you decide to wash the chicken like I do sometimes (depends on the state of the chicken), be very careful about splashing water and contaminating surfaces with unwanted bacteria. If you do rinse your chicken, don’t worry about patting it dry, as you need water in the marinade—if your chicken is relatively dry / drained, add 1 tablespoon of water.
Cut your chicken into uniform 1 inch chunks (for even cooking) and place into a bowl. Add the garlic and onion powders, sesame oil, white pepper and salt. Mix until all pieces are uniformly coated, and let it sit for 5 minutes. Any excess water should be fully absorbed by the chicken. If not, mix the chicken again and let it sit for another 5 minutes.
Make the batter:
Mix together the all-purpose flour, cornstarch, baking powder, and baking soda in a bowl, and add 2/3 cup of ice water. Use a fork to mix until a batter is formed, and stir in 1 tablespoon of oil. Set aside.
Fry the chicken:
The amount of oil you need depends on the size of the pot you will use. Using a larger pot uses more oil, but allows you to cook the chicken in fewer batches. Using a smaller pot uses less oil, but you’ll have to fry more batches of chicken. We usually go for a smaller pot, so we have less leftover oil. Heat the oil in a small pot until it reaches 335 degrees F. I
Place 5 to 6 pieces of marinated chicken into the batter. Use a chopstick, fork, or your fingers to coat the chicken in the batter and place each piece slowly into the oil.
Use a slotted spoon to carefully turn the chicken so all sides are uniformly fried. Fry for about 2 minutes, or until the batter is a light golden brown and crispy. Remove with a slotted spoon and let any excess oil drain off before placing onto a rack or paper towel lined plate.
Assemble in the Wok:
Heat 1 tablespoon canola oil in a wok over medium high heat, and add the red onion and peppers. Stir-fry for 30 seconds.
Next, add the sweet and sour sauce you prepared earlier and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat so the sauce is simmering.
Stir up your cornstarch slurry until it is uniform. While stirring the sweet and sour sauce, drizzle the slurry into the sauce. The sauce should be thick enough to coat a spoon. Turn down the heat and give the sauce a quick taste––now is the time to add more salt, vinegar or sugar if desired.
Add the pineapple chunks (if using) and stir until warmed through. Now is the time to refry the chicken to make them nice and crispy. Heat the oil up to 335 degrees F and fry the chicken in two batches for about 45 seconds each time and they will crisp right up again. Then add the chicken pieces to your sauce, and gently toss with your wok spatula until the chicken is coated.

Make sure you provide plenty of time for this step. It’s best to let your turkey thaw overnight in the kitchen sink a couple of days before Thanksgiving (if it’s frozen solid) or the day before you’re going to cook it (preferably the morning, as it will still need to marinate). When the turkey is completely thawed, remove it from the wrapper, and if the inside of the turkey is still frozen, run some warm water into the cavity and let it sit for a few more hours to thaw. If you’re in a hurry, you can soak the turkey in lukewarm water to aid the thawing process.
This is the single most important step to ensuring your turkey cooks evenly. Be sure to also remove the giblet package in the cavity and thoroughly rinse the cavity and outside of the turkey. Next, drain all of the water from the cavity, and pat the whole turkey dry with paper towels. You can also let it drip dry on a rack.
Make the marinade by mixing together ¼ cup ground bean sauce, 3 tablespoons hoisin sauce, 4 teaspoons minced garlic, 1 tablespoon finely minced shallot, 2 teaspoons minced fresh ginger, 1½ tablespoons salt, 3 tablespoons Shaoxing wine, and 1 teaspoon five spice powder.
Rub the turkey down inside and out with the marinade, ensuring all surfaces are thoroughly coated. Work the marinade under the skin where possible. If you think you have too much marinade, use the surplus amount in the cavity. Finish the turkey by placing the Chinese dried tangerine peels into the cavity.
Place the turkey in a roasting pan, cover it with plastic wrap, and refrigerate overnight. The next day, take the turkey out 3 hours prior to roasting to bring it up to room temperature.
When you’re ready to cook the turkey, line the roasting pan with the 3 pounds of chopped potatoes and the chopped leek. Place the turkey on top of the vegetables, breast side down. (We’re going to flip it later).
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F, and arrange an oven rack in the lower third of the oven. While that’s happening, prepare the glaze. Mix together ⅓ cup hot water, 2 teaspoons red Zhejiang vinegar, and 3 tablespoons of honey. Set aside.
Roast your Cantonese turkey for 30 minutes. Then use a basting brush to glaze the turkey with your honey mixture and rotate the pan 180 degrees. Roast for another 30 minutes, and give the turkey another basting with the glaze.
Remove the turkey from the oven, and lower the temperature to 325 degrees F. Using a clean kitchen towel and a sturdy roasting fork, flip the turkey breast-side up. Carefully brush off any vegetables that may be stuck to the turkey, taking care not to damage the skin on the breast.
Roast the turkey at the lower temperature for another hour and 5 minutes (for a 13 pound turkey) to an hour and a half (for a 15 pound turkey). Glaze the turkey every 15 minutes, and rotate the pan halfway through the second block of roasting time. If the turkey is browning too much, tent it lightly with aluminum foil.
The surest way to check if your turkey is cooked through is to use a meat thermometer. The internal temperature of the thigh should register 165 degrees and the juices should run clear (not pink).
When your turkey is done, transfer it to a serving plate, cover it lightly with aluminum foil, and let it rest for 20 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to scoop the potatoes and leeks out of the pan. Serve them as-is, or make them into a delicious side of roasted mashed potatoes (just add milk, butter, and salt to taste).

Finely mince ½ cup of the corn kernels and set aside. Add the chicken stock, minced and whole corn kernels, and turmeric powder to a pot and bring to a low boil. Reduce the heat, cover, and simmer for 10 minutes.
Next, add the sesame oil, salt, and white pepper. Turn up the heat slightly. Add the chicken to the soup, and use a spoon to break up any clumps of chicken while stirring for one minute.
Re-mix the cornstarch and chicken stock slurry until incorporated (since the cornstarch and water will separate when left to sit for more than a few minutes). Use a spoon or a whisk to stir the soup while slowly pouring in the cornstarch slurry. The soup will begin to thicken further as the cornstarch cooks. Keep stirring for another 30 seconds.

Next, use a large spoon or ladle to gently stir the soup in one direction, while slowly pouring the beaten egg whites into the soup.

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F and place a rack in the lower third position of your oven. Spread the onions and carrots evenly in your roasting pan.
Take the chicken out of the refrigerator and allow it to sit at room temperature for about 2 hours. If the chicken is cold, it will be difficult to cook it evenly. Remove the chicken giblets and rinse the chicken inside and out. Pat the chicken thoroughly dry with paper towels, and season the cavity liberally with salt and pepper. Then combine the melted butter and olive oil with an additional 2 ½ teaspoons of salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Rub this mixture all over the outside of the chicken, as well as under the skin where you can get it.
Put the thyme inside the cavity, along with the lemon and garlic halves. Tie the legs together with kitchen string, and place the chicken on top of the bed of carrots and onions, breast-side up.
Roast for 75-85 minutes, or until the juices run clear when you cut between the leg and thigh.
Remove the chicken and vegetables to a platter and cover with aluminum foil for about 20 minutes. Slice the chicken, and serve it with the vegetables. Reserve the pan drippings for the stock.
Part 2: Making the Stock
Once you’re done eating the chicken, remove the lemon halves, thyme and garlic that you roasted the chicken with. Add the chicken carcass to a stockpot. You can also add any leftover roasted vegetables you may have.
Take half of your warm water and pour it into your roasting pan. Use a spoon to lift up all the bits from the bottom of the pan, and pour the liquid from the pan into your stockpot.
Add the additional 6 cups water, carrots, celery, onion, garlic, peppercorns, and bay leaves. Bring to a boil, and then reduce the heat to low. Cover. Allow the stock to simmer for about 6-8 hours, periodically skimming any foam off the surface.
Strain the stock into containers, and freeze, or use the stock for whatever soup or other application you like.

Next, combine the hot water, sugar, soy sauces and white pepper in a small bowl. This is the sauce that you’ll be adding to the rice, and it’s much easier to have it combined and ready to go before you start cooking. If you have questions about light and dark soy sauce, be sure to check out our Chinese sauces, vinegar, and oils ingredient page.
Take your cooked rice and fluff it with a fork or with your hands (you can rinse your hands in cold water if the rice starts sticking to them). If you are using cold leftover rice, try to break up the clumps as best as possible.
Heat the wok over medium high heat and add 1 tablespoon of oil. Add the eggs and scramble them until just done. You can even start scooping them up when they look like they are almost done and set aside. They will continue to cook in the bowl and you will cook them again in the rice. I'm only harping on this because you don’t want dried egg bits in your chicken fried rice!
Heat the wok until just smoking and spread another tablespoon oil around your wok. Sear the marinated chicken in one layer for 20 seconds. Stir-fry the chicken until about 80% done. Remove the chicken to your marinade bowl and set aside.
With the wok over medium high heat, add another tablespoon of oil and sauté the onions until translucent. Add the rice, and use your metal spatula to flatten out and break up any large clumps. If the rice is cold from the refrigerator, continue stir-frying until the rice is warmed up, which will take about 5 minutes. Sprinkling just a little water on large clumps of rice will help break them up more easily. If the rice was made fresh, cooking time will be faster. Just make sure that the rice isn't too wet––which will make frying it difficult.
Once the rice is warmed (very important or the sauce will not mix as well and the color of the rice will not be as uniform), add the sauce mixture and mix with a scooping motion until the rice is evenly coated with sauce. You will have to break up any remaining clumps of rice with the spatula as best as possible, but no need to be obsessive. The rice should be hot by this time. Now add the chicken and any juices from the bowl you set aside earlier and stir fry for another minute.
Add the eggs, bean sprouts, and scallions, and continue stir-frying the rice for another 30 seconds. Then gather all of the rice into the middle of the wok to let the sides of the wok heat up. After about 20 seconds, spread the Shaoxing wine around the perimeter of the wok and stir-fry for another 20 seconds.

In a small saucepan over low heat, add the oil. Throw in the scallion pieces, star anise, and Sichuan peppercorns. Keep the pan over low heat for about 10 minutes, until fragrant. Pick out all the spices, so you essentially have a pot full of spiced oil. Stir in the flour and five-spice powder to create a thin roux. Set it aside, and let it cool completely.
Make the dough:
In a mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the flour and add the boiling water. Mix with a fork or a pair of chopsticks. Gradually add the cold water and knead everything together to form a smooth dough ball. Cover with a damp cloth and let it rest for 30 minutes.
Assembly:
Depending on the pancake size you want, divide the dough into 4-8 equal pieces. Lightly brush some oil on a clean work surface. Roll each piece of dough into a long rope, and then use a rolling pin to roll it flat. Brush a thin layer of the roux all over the dough, and then sprinkle it sparingly with sesame seeds, chopped scallion, and salt.
Start on one end and roll the dough up. Stand the roll upright and press it down with your palm. Lightly roll out the resulting circle until you get a pancake that’s between 1/4-1/2” thick. It’s ok of the outer edges break open a bit. Repeat for each pancake.
At this point, you can cook them, or freeze them by separating each pancake with a layer of plastic wrap or wax paper, and then putting them in a freezer bag. There’s no need for thawing when you want to cook them.
To cook the pancakes:
Heat a pan over medium heat and add a tablespoon or two of oil. Place the pancake in the pan. Once the bottom starts to turn a little golden, add two teaspoons of water to the sides of the pan (don’t pour the water on the pancake), and immediately cover with a lid. Cook 3 minutes. Uncover the pan, flip the pancake, and do the same steps with the other side.
To finish, uncover the lid again, turn up the heat slightly, and brown both sides while flipping the pancake occasionally. When it’s golden brown, use a pair of chopsticks to squeeze and pinch the pancake a couple times to loosen the layers (this step is optional), because you ideally want to see the layers when you hand-pull it apart. The cooked pancake should be crispy and slightly chewy.",en-US,5.0,,The Woks of Life,55,4 serving(s),1 serving,430 kcal,68 g,10 g,13 g,1 g,,299 mg,1 g,4 g,,

Bring to a boil and simmer over low heat for 1 hour until the chicken is falling off the bone. Set the chicken aside and strain the water (now turned into stock!) into a large bowl.
While the chicken is cooking, heat the 2 tbsp. of vegetable oil in a sauté pan. Add the okra and sauté over medium high heat until the “ropiness” is gone (i.e the goopy strands of okra-ness). When the okra is done, turn off the heat and set it aside.
Now comes the important step of making the signature gumbo roux. In the large pot you initially used for the chicken, add 2/3 cup vegetable oil and 3/4 cup flour. Whisk constantly for 20 minutes. Start with medium-low heat, and as it turns darker, switch to low heat. The roux should be a dark caramel color.
When you’ve got the perfect color for your roux, add the onion, bell pepper, celery, and garlic to the pot. Sauté them until tender, coating everything in that roux. This can take a bit of time, as you want the heat still around medium or medium-low to make sure the roux doesn’t burn.
When the veggies are tender, add the sliced sausage. Once the sausage is lightly browned, add the sautéed okra, and the tomatoes. Cook for 15 minutes. This is a good time to remove the skin and bone from the chicken thighs and roughly shred them with your hands or two forks.
Add the chicken stock and shredded chicken and stir until combined. Then, season the entire mixture with the bay leaves, thyme, basil, cayenne pepper, paprika, salt, and pepper. Mix thoroughly and bring to a low boil. Simmer for 1 hour with the pot loosely covered, stirring occasionally. After an hour, add the hot sauce and adjust seasoning if needed.

Put chopped peanuts, roasted sesame seeds, red pepper flakes and salt into a medium bowl and set it aside.

Give everything a stir and cover the bowl with a plate to seal everything inside. Walk away and don't come back until everything else is ready!
Step 2:
Bring a medium pot of water to a boil (there should be enough water to submerge the chicken) along with the ginger and scallion. Once it's boiling, add the chicken (once it's added the water will probably stop boiling because of the temperature change).
Bring the water to a boil again, and after a minute, cover the pot and immediately turn off the heat. Let it sit on the stove for 20 minutes to slowly poach the chicken.

Shake off the excess water and pat the chicken dry with paper towels or a clean dish cloth.
Brush the Shaoxing wine all over the chicken, including the cavity. Next, combine the sand ginger powder, ground white pepper, and 2 teaspoons salt. Rub the mixture all over the chicken, including the cavity.
Now set the chicken on a wire rack, and place it over a tray to catch any drippings. It’s best if you can sit the chicken upright so the liquid in its cavity can drip out. You can use a drinking glass to prop it up. Leave the chicken uncovered and let marinate overnight in the refrigerator. The objective is to dry out the chicken skin.
The next day, take the chicken out of the refrigerator for at least one to two hours before cooking, so the chicken can come up to room temperature. Insert the ginger slices into the cavity and brush the chicken skin with oil. Next, tie up the drumsticks with kitchen twine. Finally, wrap the chicken with a large piece of parchment paper, then wrap it again with a second piece of parchment with the opening on the breast side. Set the chicken aside.
Now “stir-fry” the rest of the salt in a clean dry wok for about 15 minutes, using medium heat until the salt turns light brown. The salt gets very hot, so be careful not to burn yourself or stir too vigorously. Next, fill a wok or Dutch oven with about a ½-inch of hot salt spread evenly across the bottom. Position the chicken with the breast side up in the center of the pot. Next, add the rest of the hot salt onto the chicken to make sure it’s completely covered. Top your vessel of choice with the lid, and cook over medium heat for 35 minutes. Then turn off the heat, and let it sit on the stove, covered, for another 30 to 40 minutes until the salt is warm to the touch.
Once the salt is warm to the touch, use a wooden spoon or a spatula to carefully lift the chicken out of the salt. Be very careful--the chicken is still very hot despite sitting with the heat off for 30-40 minutes. Carefully unwrap the parchment paper, and let it cool slightly until it’s not too hot to handle.
As for how to serve the chicken, this dish is usually served with the meat deboned and pulled apart. You don’t have to follow these steps, but your diners (in our case, Sarah) will appreciate your effort! Plus, the chicken bone and carcass do make a lovely broth.

Squab in the US almost always come frozen, and oftentimes, they only come dressed on the outside, which means that you must cut a small opening near the tail in order to remove the remove the organs and clean the inside.
Take care to cut a small opening, and not to rip the skin when cleaning it. The best cut to make is a small horizontal cut 1 to 1½ inches wide between the tail and the bottom of the breast. It’s the same place where all poultry are cut and cleaned out. Once the cut is made, you’ll have to carefully use two fingers to pull out the entrails--including the heart, gizzard, liver, lungs and any glands that are attached to the cavity. It will take a few passes and lots of rinsing with cold water to get them cleaned out.
After the insides are thoroughly cleaned, use kitchen shears to clip off the talons and tuck the feet inside the cavity. You can also just cut off the claws (some old folks like to eat them with a cold beer) and just leave the legs. For a Chinese New Year bird, Chinese people tend to leave the legs, tail, and head intact. It is an old Chinese tradition to serve any bird with both the head and tail on for Chinese New Year dinner. It’s true also for the classic poached chicken, Cantonese white cut chicken, which is a required dish at all Cantonese Lunar New Year dinners!
In a medium-sized pot, add the ginger, garlic, scallions, sugar, salt, Shaoxing wine, soy sauce, Chinese spice packet, water, and bring to a boil. The liquid should be quite salty––almost as salty as the sea, like when you cook pasta. Turn the heat down and let the sauce simmer for 15 minutes.
Next, carefully place the squab into the pot until they are fully submerged, and the cavities are filled with the hot liquid. Lift the squab out, emptying the liquid inside the cavity and return them back to the pot, again ensuring there are no air pockets in the cavity. This is the same method used in our classic Cantonese poached chicken; it ensures that there are no cold spots and that the poultry cooks evenly.
Reduce the heat to the lowest setting so the liquid is almost (but not actually) simmering. Let the squab cook for 30 minutes. Another easier method is to let the liquid simmer for 5 minutes with the squab, then turn off the heat completely, and leave the pot covered on the stove for another 25 minutes.
While the squab is cooking, prepare a large bowl of cold water. After the squab are done, remove them from the braising liquid, and soak them in the cold water, gently rubbing off any impurities from the skin that may have appeared from the cooking process. Let them cool completely in the water.
While the squab are cooling in the water, mix together the maltose, red vinegar, water, and Shaoxing wine until the maltose is dissolved. Maltose is not an easy ingredient to handle. It’s quite stiff and has the texture of taffy. Use your hand to remove the maltose from the measuring spoon and rub it into the water and vinegar mixture to help it dissolve.
Remove the squab from the water, gently shaking off any excess liquid. Roll the pigeon in the maltose vinegar mixture, using your hands to ensure all of the surface area gets coated. Do your best to keep the vinegar and maltose solution on the outside of the pigeon only. This maltose vinegar bath gives the skin a light coating that ensures crispy skin during the frying process.
Once the pigeons are thoroughly marinated, set aside, and air dry for a total of 2 hours. If you have a fan, point one at the birds to speed up the drying process. Turn the pigeons over after 1 hour and use a towel to wipe any liquid from the plate so it is dry. This bath and drying process is another measure to ensure that your traditional fried pigeon dish will have a crispy skin.
Now it’s time to fry the squab. Heat 6 cups of canola oil to 350 degrees F in a small wok. Use a thermometer to ensure the temperature is accurate. Usually, I recommend a small pot for deep frying to save oil, but in this case, it’s best to use a small round bottomed wok for frying.
Once your oil has come up to temperature, place one of the squab on the Chinese spider strainer breast down, and carefully lower it into the hot oil. At the same time, use your metal hoak or ladle to repeatedly spoon hot oil over the top of the pigeon. Make sure you pour hot oil over the head, neck, legs and tail. Try to angle the pigeon so the cavity opening is pointed down. Don’t pour oil into the cavity.
Repeat this process, turning the squab over if needed until your fried pigeon is a uniform amber color. How dark you want your fried pigeon is a personal preference. My experience eating this dish at restaurants is that they are generally a darker amber color. Repeat the process, one-by-one, for the rest of the squab.
The way to serve these fried pigeons is to cut off the head and place them at the head of the plate. We do the same thing for Cantonese Ginger Scallion Lobster. Cut off the claws and set them at the bottom of the plate opposite the heads. Next, use a chef’s knife or kitchen shears to cut the fried pigeon in half lengthwise and cut each half into a breast and leg quarter piece for a total of four pieces. Arrange the fried pigeon pieces on a large plate with freshly fried shrimp chips (you can quickly make these after you’ve finished frying the squab), lemon wedges and your five spice salt on the side.",en-US,5.0,,The Woks of Life,180,4 serving(s),1 serving,579 kcal,14 g,16 g,40 g,4 g,75 mg,765 mg,12 g,1 g,,

Budget about 1 day of thawing time for every 5 pounds. On the day before you plan to roast it, make the marinade by combining the garlic, salt, black pepper, olive oil, and butter in the food processor. Pulse until you have a very fine paste.
Put your carrots, celery, and onions on the bottom of your roasting pan. This will be the roasting ""rack"" that your turkey will sit on.
Remove the turkey from the package. Remove the neck and the giblets from the turkey cavity and give the bird a good rinse with cold water. Pat it thoroughly dry with paper towels, and lay it breast side up in the pan.
Spread half of your marinade all over the top side of the turkey, making sure you cover every surface and crevice, including the cavity. Flip the bird over so it's laying breast side down, and spread the other half of the marinade over this side of the turkey. Cover the roasting pan tightly with plastic and allow to marinate overnight. You can also spread some marinade over the neck and the giblets and add them to the roasting pan as well.
On the morning of the big day, take the turkey out of the fridge and let it sit on the counter (so you're not putting a cold turkey directly into the oven, which can prevent it from cooking evenly). About 3 hours before you're ready to eat, preheat the oven to 425 degrees F and arrange the oven rack so it's in the lower third of the oven. Take the plastic off your roasting pan and lift up the turkey to empty any liquid that might have accumulated in the cavity as it sat out on the counter. Make sure the wings are tucked in, and roast at 425 degrees for 1 hour, rotating the pan halfway through.
Remove the turkey from the oven and lower the temperature to 325 degrees. Using clean kitchen towels or a sturdy wooden spoon, flip the turkey breast-side up. Roast the turkey at the lower temperature for another hour (for a 12 pound turkey) to an hour and a half (for a 14 pound turkey), until the thigh registers 165 degrees and the juices run clear (i.e. not pink). Rotate the pan halfway through the second roasting process as well.
Remove the turkey from the oven, transfer to a carving board or serving plate, cover loosely with foil, and allow to rest for 20-30 minutes before carving.
Now, we know everyone has their own method for gravy, but here's ours: tip all the drippings from the roasting pan into a gravy separator. You want about 10 tablespoons of fat and 6 cups of the juices. If you don't have enough of either, you can add butter (if you need more fat) and chicken stock (if you don't have enough juice). In a large saucepan over medium heat, add the turkey fat and/or butter. Gradually stir in enough flour to make a roux, whisking constantly. Continue whisking until the roux turns a dark brown color, about 10 minutes. Slowly whisk in the turkey juices and/or broth. Season with salt and black pepper to taste. Simmer until thickened (when it coats the back of a spoon, it's perfect). If it's too thick, add more broth or water.

Next, add the rest of the marinade ingredients: 1 teaspoon canola oil, 2 teaspoons cornstarch, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and a pinch of ground white pepper. Mix well and set aside for 20 minutes.
Heat the wok over high heat until it just starts to smoke. Coat the perimeter of the wok with two tablespoons of oil, and spread the chicken in one layer around the wok. Let it sear for 20 seconds. Turn the chicken and let the other side sear for another 20 seconds. Turn the heat off, and transfer the chicken back to your marinade bowl. The chicken should be about 60% done.
Turn the burner back on to high heat, and add another tablespoon of oil, along with the ginger slices. Let the ginger infuse the oil for about 10 seconds. Add the scallions and garlic and stir fry for another 15 seconds. Next, add the mushrooms, bamboo shoots, and water chestnuts. Stir fry for 30 seconds, and add the bok choy.
Next, add the Shaoxing wine and stir-fry for another minute. Then add the seared chicken slices and the hot chicken stock. It’s important to add hot or even boiling chicken stock to keep the wok up to temperature. Most stove burners at home don’t generate enough heat for a good stir-fry, so this is especially important for home cooks!
While the mixture is coming to a boil, add about a teaspoon of salt and a pinch of white pepper, along with the sugar, oyster sauce, and sesame oil. Stir until well-combined. Taste the sauce with a spoon and re-season to taste.
Give the cornstarch slurry a quick stir, as the water and starch tend to separate, and add slowly to the wok while stirring constantly. You can add more or less slurry, depending upon how thick you like your sauce to be. After a minute, the sauce should be thickened.

1148,Grilled Tandoori Chicken with Indian-Style Rice,Bill,https://thewoksoflife.com/grilled-tandoori-chicken/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/grilled-tandoori-chicken-12.jpg,"['3 ounces plain Greek yogurt ((85g))', '2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice', '2 tablespoons garlic ((minced))', '2 tablespoons fresh ginger ((grated))', '2 teaspoons oil', '2½ teaspoons salt', '2 teaspoons ground Indian red pepper ((you can use cayenne or even Korean red chili powder in a pinch))', '1 tablespoon paprika', '2 teaspoons ground coriander seeds ((or coriander powder))', '1 tablespoon freshly ground cumin seed ((or powder))', '¾ teaspoon turmeric', '1 teaspoon ground cloves', '¼ teaspoon black pepper', '1½ teaspoons garam masala', '6 chicken leg quarters ((cut into drumsticks and thighs))', '1 cucumber ((sliced))', '1 medium red onion ((sliced))', 'Cilantro for garnish ((you can also use parsley))', '3 cups dry basmati rice ((585g))', '3 tablespoons oil ((or butter or ghee))', '3 teaspoons cumin seeds', '6 cloves', '1 cinnamon stick', '2 teaspoons salt ((or to taste))', '1 cup frozen peas']","Mix all of the marinade ingredients together in a bowl until well combined.
Use a sharp knife to cut slits into the chicken pieces; this will allow the marinade to really get into the chicken. 3 slits per drumstick and 4 to 5 per thigh should do the trick.
Usually, Tandoori Chicken calls for the skin to be removed, but I left it on because you want that crispy chicken skin (obviously). You can decide for yourself, but be aware that skin-on chicken is more prone to flare-ups when grilling. You’ll have to watch the chicken more closely while it’s on the grill and flip the pieces more often to avoid hot spots--all reasonable trade-offs for some extra flavor!
Place the chicken in a large dish. Spread the marinade all over the chicken and let marinate at least 12 hours, but not more than 2 days. We marinated our chicken for 16 hours, and even more marinating time wouldn’t have hurt!
Be sure to take the chicken out of the refrigerator 3 to 4 hours prior to grilling, so the chicken can come to room temperature--kind of like how you never want to grill a cold steak. This is an important step since there will be marinade on the chicken, and it will burn if the chicken is left too long on the grill because its internal temperature is too low.
This is a good time to make your Indian-style jeera rice. We’ve measured out enough rice here to take down all of the chicken, but feel free to make more or less. Wash the rice thoroughly and drain into your cooking vessel. Cover with water and allow to soak for 20 minutes.
While that’s happening, heat your oil/butter/ghee in a saucepan. When it’s melted, add the cumin seeds, cloves, and cinnamon stick. Let the spices infuse the oil for 2-3 minutes. After the rice has finished soaking, drain it thoroughly and add it to the spice mixture. Sauté the rice in the pan for about 2 minutes, and transfer to a rice cooker. Add the salt and water (according to your rice cooker directions), and press Start. If you’re not using a rice cooker, use our directions for perfect stovetop rice.
Now it's time to cook the chicken. Start your grill, and keep it covered until it reaches 500 degrees.
Shake off the excess marinade before placing the chicken on the hot grill. Cook with the grill covered, but stay close to watch for excess smoke, a sure indicator that your chicken is charring!
Turn the chicken as often as needed to prevent burning and keep the grill cover on so the chicken cooks through quickly. Our chicken took about 45 minutes, and we did have to turn and move the chicken pieces often.
The chicken is done when the juices run clear when poked or, better yet, use an instant-read thermometer to check the temperature near the bone. The optimal temperature for chicken is 165 degrees F.
For the rice, during the last 2-3 minutes of cooking time, add the frozen peas and stir thoroughly. Let the rice reheat. Serve the chicken with the rice, sliced fresh cucumbers, sliced red onion, and cilantro.",en-US,4.94,,The Woks of Life,1005,8 serving(s),1 serving,279 kcal,6 g,20 g,20 g,5 g,107 mg,827 mg,2 g,2 g,,

Add 1 teaspoon soy sauce and 1 teaspoon cornstarch until well combined, and set aside.
Next, make the gravy. In a medium pot or saucepan, heat 1 tablespoon of oil over medium heat. Add 1 tablespoon of flour to make a roux, and cook for 15-20 seconds. Stir in the turmeric, paprika, garlic powder, and onion powder. Let fry for 15 seconds, and whisk in the chicken stock.
Bring the mixture to a simmer, and add the soy sauce, oyster sauce, sesame oil, and freshly ground white pepper to taste. The gravy should be slightly thickened from the roux. Mix the cornstarch with the ¼ cup of chicken stock or water to make a slurry (i.e. until the cornstarch is completely dissolved), and slowly stir in two-thirds of the mixture. Let cook for 30 seconds. Add more of the cornstarch slurry if necessary, until the gravy is thick enough to coat a spoon. Add salt or more soy sauce to your own taste. Be careful not to over-salt the gravy. Cover and set aside.
Next, sear the chicken. Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in your wok until it just starts to smoke, and add in the marinated chicken cubes. Sear for 1 minute on each side, and then stir-fry for another minute until just cooked through. Transfer back to the marinating bowl, and set aside to cool.
In a wok or deep pot, pre-heat your 6 cups of frying oil to 350F. Use a candy thermometer to check the temperature––too high a temperature will result in burned Egg Foo Young patties, and too low a temperature will give you greasy patties or will make your patties fall apart!
Meanwhile, place the cooled chicken, diced onion, and bean sprouts into a mixing bowl. Add the eggs, sesame oil, and second teaspoon of cornstarch. Do not add any salt or seasonings to this mixture, or your Egg Foo Young patties may not hold together when frying!
Use a large soup ladle or hoak (a Chinese ladle that’s often used together with a Chinese spatula) to fold the mixture together until just combined. The eggs should look like they are slightly beaten and only just mixed with the rest of the ingredients. If you over-mix the eggs, the whole mixture will become too watery and will not form a patty during frying.
Using your ladle, work quickly to slowly drop three separate scoops of the mixture into the wok for the first batch (you can also work in batches of 2 if your wok is smaller). Each scoop should be about 3/4 cup of the mixture. The correct technique is to tilt your ladle close to the oil, and pour the mixture starting from the edge where the oil meets the wok. Pour it slowly so the ladle barely touches the oil. Don’t let the egg cook while it’s in the ladle, or it will stick to the ladle, and you won’t have a smooth drop for the next Egg Foo Young patty.
Let the patties fry for about 40 seconds. You can also use your wok spatula to gently flip some hot oil on top of the uncooked patty to speed the cooking time. When each patty is solid and turning golden brown, use your wok spatula to turn them over in the same order that you dropped them into the oil.
After another 60 seconds, scoop each patty onto a mesh strainer, giving it a few gentle taps to remove excess oil. Place each patty on a wire rack over a sheet pan to drain until all of your patties are cooked.
Transfer the Egg Foo Young patties from the cooling rack to a serving plate (ideally these are served individually, rather than on a big family-style platter), pour the gravy over the top, add a sprinkling of scallions and toasted sesame seeds, and serve with additional gravy on the side.",en-US,4.99,,The Woks of Life,50,4 serving(s),1 serving,420 kcal,20 g,28 g,26 g,11 g,299 mg,455 mg,4 g,2 g,,

In a medium bowl, combine the sliced flank steak with the baking soda, water and oyster sauce. Massage these ingredients into the beef until any liquid has been absorbed by the meat. Marinate for 30 minutes.
Lightly dredge all of the beef slices in cornstarch. Set aside until ready to fry.
Slice all the fresh peppers crosswise into thin slices on the diagonal. Set aside the dried red peppers. Do not break them open or chop unless you want a very spicy Hunan Beef!
Stir the sugar into 2 tablespoons of hot water until dissolved. Add the Chinese black vinegar, soy sauce, and ground white pepper. Mix until well combined and set aside.
Heat your wok over high heat until smoking. Spread ⅓ cup oil around the wok, and sear the beef in three batches on both sides until browned and slightly crispy on the outside. Be sure the wok and oil are hot each time you add a batch of beef.
Drain the crispy beef by moving it up to the side of the wok. The oil will drain to the bottom and you can then transfer the beef to a sheet pan or plate. No need for paper towels or wire racks!
After frying the beef, leave about 2 tablespoons of the oil in the wok, and remove any excess. If your wok got burned in the frying process, this is a good time to wash it. While you want the beef flavor from frying, you definitely don’t want burned bits in the stir-fry if you got carried away with the heat during frying.
Assembling the stir-fry:
Set the wok over medium heat. Add the sliced ginger and fry until caramelized, about 30 seconds.
Next, add the shallots. Continue to fry for another 30 seconds, and add the fresh peppers (except for the red holland or fresno peppers). Turn the heat up to high and stir-fry for 1 minute to get a nice sear on the peppers.
Clear a section on the bottom of the wok, and add the dried chili peppers. Let them toast in the oil for 20 seconds. (If you want your dish spicier, add the dried chili peppers earlier, along with the shallots.)
Next, pour the Shaoxing wine around the perimeter of the wok. Add the sliced garlic, fermented black beans, and the red Holland or Fresno peppers. Stir-fry for another 30 to 60 seconds on high heat.
Next, add the fried beef and pour over the pre-prepared sauce. Maintain the highest heat possible and stir-fry everything together for 20 seconds. Add the scallions.

Add the ground beef, breaking it up with a spatula. Cook until browned. Next, add the curry powder, turmeric, cumin, sugar, black pepper, and salt. Stir everything together and allow the mixture to cook for another couple of minutes.
While that’s happening, make a cornstarch slurry by mixing the beef broth with 1 tablespoon of cornstarch. Stir the slurry into the beef mixture and simmer for a few minutes, until the entire mixture has thickened. You’ll know it’s ready when there’s no more pooling liquid––just a very viscous curry beef! Transfer the beef mixture to a bowl and allow to cool.
Once the filling has cooled, take your puff pastry out of the freezer and defrost for about 35-40 minutes--no more. Unfold each puff pastry sheet, and cut each one into 9 squares.
Spoon about 3 tablespoons of filling onto each square, and fold diagonally to form a triangle, pressing the edges together. Crimp the edges with a fork and transfer to a baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining squares of puff pastry. You’ll need two baking sheets.
When the puffs are formed, refrigerate for 15-20 minutes and preheat your oven to 400 degrees F. When the oven is preheated, remove the puffs from the refrigerator, and brush with egg wash. Bake the puffs (one sheet at a time) for 15-18 minutes or until golden brown. Let cool for 10-15 minutes before attempting to eat, as the filling will be very hot!

Heat your wok until just smoking, and coat your wok with 2 tablespoons vegetable oil. A seasoned carbon steel wok or a non-stick pan is good for this hamburger fried rice, since the rice in this dish is prone to sticking.
Add your ground beef and stir-fry until browned and fragrant. Break the hamburger meat up, but don’t be obsessive about it. It’s ok to have small delicious chunks of ground beef with the rice.

Cut the tomatoes into relatively large chunks. If using cherry or grape tomatoes, you can halve them or leave them whole.
Toss the tomatoes with 1 tablespoon salt, 4 tablespoons olive oil, 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar, and 3 cloves of minced garlic. Then arrange them in a single layer across two large rimmed baking sheets.
Roast for 1 hour in the middle of the oven, stirring once or twice. The tomatoes should look wrinkled, with slight caramelization on the edges.
About 15 minutes before your tomatoes are done roasting, place a large dutch oven or deep pot over medium high heat. Add 4 tablespoons of olive oil, along with the ground beef and pork. Stir, breaking up the chunks of ground meat into small crumbles. There is no need to brown or crisp them meat—cook just until it turns opaque.
Add the chopped onion and last 3 cloves of minced garlic. Season with salt and pepper, and cook for another 5 minutes.
By now the tomatoes should be done roasting. Add them to the pot, along with all their juices. Also add the tomato paste, beef stock, red wine, dried oregano, and black pepper, and sugar.

Set aside. (We added a bit of water to marinate the beef, which generally is a no-no for beef...but for this fried rice dish, it keeps the small morsels of beef juicy and tender!)
Next, combine the hot water, sugar, sesame oil, soy sauces, MSG (if using), and white pepper in a small bowl. This is the sauce that you’ll be adding to the rice, and it’s much easier to have it combined and ready to go before you start cooking.
Take your cooked rice and fluff it with a fork or with your hands (you can rinse your hands in cold water if the rice starts sticking to them). If you are using cold leftover rice, try to break up the clumps as best as possible.
Heat your wok over medium high heat, add 1 tablespoon of oil and the eggs, and scramble them until just cooked. You can start scooping them up when they look like they are almost done. Transfer them back into the same bowl you mixed them in and set aside. They will continue to cook in the bowl and you will cook them again in the rice.
Heat the wok until just smoking and spread 1 tablespoon oil around your wok. Add the marinated beef in one layer, and let sear for 20 seconds. Next, stir fry the beef until about 70% done. Transfer the beef back to the marinade bowl, and set aside.
With the wok over medium high heat, add the last tablespoon of oil, and sauté the onions until translucent, about 2 minutes. Add the rice, using a metal spatula to flatten out and break up any large clumps. If the rice is cold from the refrigerator, continue stir-frying until the rice is warmed up, about 5 minutes. Also, sprinkling a little water on large clumps of rice will help break them up more easily.
Once the rice is warmed through, add the sauce mixture. Stir the rice with a scooping motion until the grains are evenly coated with sauce. The rice should be completely hot by now. Next, add the beef and any juices from the bowl you set aside earlier, and stir fry for another minute.
Add the eggs, breaking up any large clumps, peas, and the scallions. Continue stir-frying for another 30 seconds. Push the rice into the middle of the wok to let the perimeter of the wok heat up. After about 20 seconds, pour 1 tablespoon of Shaoxing wine around the perimeter of the wok. Stir-fry for another 20 seconds. Adding the wine using this method gives the dish a little extra wok hei!

In another large, thick-bottomed soup pot, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the rock sugar, the white parts of the scallion, and the garlic. Cook for a few minutes until the scallions are lightly seared. Add the beef, turn up the heat, and mix everything well.
Cook for about 5 minutes, and stir once or twice in between. Now add the Shaoxing wine, dark soy sauce, and light soy sauce, and stir everything together well so that the beef is coated in the soy sauce.
Now add the aromatics, plus the daikon, and the broth and ginger pieces that you boiled the beef in. Bring everything to a boil and immediately turn the heat down to medium. Simmer for 90 minutes. The broth should be steadily simmering where you can see water moving in the pot, but not at a rolling boil.
After 90 minutes, turn off the heat and let it stand (with the lid on) for another hour. Now your soup base is ready. Reheat, remove the aromatics, and add salt to taste before serving. Just remember, adding salt too early will dry out the beef.
Cook the noodles according to the package instructions, strain, and transfer to a large serving bowl. Blanch a handful of your leafy greens of choice in the noodle water, and add it to the noodles. Then, ladle in the beef and the soup. Top with the chopped green parts of the scallions you set aside earlier and some chopped cilantro (optional).

Place some of the meat in the pan in a single layer. It should sizzle loudly when it hits the pan. If it doesn't, the pan isn't hot enough. Don't stir or disrupt the meat for 30 to 45 seconds.

Cook for an additional 30 to 45 seconds––just long enough to sear the outside and make sure you’re getting a perfect medium-rare interior.
Scoop the steak bites and pan drippings out, and then cook the greens in the same pan if desired. To serve, scoop the rice into a bowl, add a handful of steak bites and greens, and drizzle over the ginger miso dressing.

Your prime rib roast should have a nice layer of fat on top, so it will baste itself. Before marinating, give your prime rib roast a quick rinse with cold water, and pat it dry with paper towels.
Place a flat roasting rack inside a roasting pan large enough to fit your roast, and spread the onions on top of the rack. It’s ok if you don’t have a roasting rack--resting the roast directly on the onions works also. Place the roast in the pan.
Mix the salt, pepper, garlic, herbs and olive oil in a bowl until well-combined. Use your hands to rub the roast all over with the marinade mixture, coating the surface evenly.
Use plastic wrap to cover the roast, and let it marinate overnight (at least 8 hours) in the refrigerator. We don’t expect the flavors to penetrate the roast completely, but it will work its way into the fatty collar portion of the roast. Skipping this step makes a big difference in flavor––we’ve had some mediocre roasts due to a lack of marinating time, so take my word for it!
Take the roast out of the refrigerator at least 2 hours before cooking time to allow the roast to come up to room temperature. It's best to take it out in the morning and leave it out 6 to 8 hours especially if you have a bone-in roast. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F, and place your roast on a lower oven rack. For bone -in roasts, you may want to put the roast at the bottom of the oven for the first hour. Placing the oven rack too high up will cause your roast to brown too quickly and burn!
After 30 minutes in the oven, add a ½ cup of water to the bottom of the roasting pan. The key is to allow the onions to brown and caramelize while roasting, but not to burn and smoke in the fat.
Cook the roast for another 30 minutes, until it begins to brown. If your oven heats unevenly, turn your roast 180 degrees. If there is more fat on one side that has not browned yet, make sure you position that side of the prime rib roast toward the inside of the oven. Use your own judgement on this one!
Once the prime rib roast is browned on the outside (1 hour total should do it, but times may vary depending on your oven), lower the heat to 350 degrees F. Continue roasting the prime rib for another 90 to 120 minutes. Baste the roast every 30 minutes if desired, and add hot water ½ cup at a time if the roasting pan does dry up.
If the top of the roast starts to char, put a small piece of foil to lightly cover the top, leaving the sides exposed. Again, turn the roast 180 degrees if needed for even roasting.
A general rule I use to approximate roasting time is a total of 15 minutes per pound, so for this 12 pound roast, the total roasting time should be 180 minutes. With temperature changes, that means roasting at at 450 degrees F for 60 minutes followed by 120 minutes at 350 degrees F. That said, these times are approximate--using a meat thermometer is a must. You don’t want to overcook it! We always cook for medium rare, so the time will be closer to 90 minutes, or when the prime rib roast reaches an internal temperature of 125 degrees F. This gives you two more well-done Prime Rib end cuts and a couple of medium pieces mixed in with the medium rare cuts. If you like it rare, then roast for less time, taking the roast out of the oven when the internal temperature reaches 120 degrees F. If your like it super-rare, then 115 degrees F may be for you. Just remember that the meat thermometer is your guide and that the roast will continue to cook a bit while it rests on the kitchen counter!
When ready, set your prime rib on a cutting board or serving platter, and lightly cover it with a piece of aluminum foil to rest for 15 to 20 minutes.
While the prime rib is resting, pour the pan juices through a fine mesh strainer into a fat separator. If there is not enough liquid, add a ½ cup of water to the hot pan, and stir lightly. Pour the juices from the fat separator into a small pot or saute pan and set aside. Warm up the au jus, and serve alongside the prime rib.

Mix all of the ingredients into the beef. Set aside for 10 minutes.
Combine warmed beef stock or water with 2 tablespoons soy sauce, 1 teaspoon dark soy sauce, 2 tablespoons oyster sauce, ½ teaspoon sesame oil, ½ teaspoon salt, ¼ teaspoon sugar and 1/8 teaspoon ground white pepper. Use pure beef stock only. Many are made with celery, tomato, and carrot, which will make this stir-fry taste like beef stew! If you can’t find a purer stock, use water and/or a beef bullion cube. Just remember to adjust the seasoning accordingly, as they can be salty. You can add more water and cornstarch slurry to offset this effect.
Heat your carbon steel wok until it’s just smoking. Spread 2 tablespoons oil around the perimeter, and add the beef.
Use your wok spatula to spread the beef out, and sear for 30 seconds. Stir-fry the beef for another 30 seconds until it’s 80% done, and transfer the beef back to the bowl.
Without washing the wok, turn the heat back on to medium. Add 1 tablespoon of oil to the wok, and immediately add the ginger, white portion of the scallions and garlic. Stir-fry for 15 seconds, and add the mushrooms.
Next spread 1½ tablespoons of Shaoxing wine around the perimeter of the wok to deglaze, and stir-fry everything for 20 seconds.
Add the stock and sauces to the wok, and bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally to deglaze the wok and heat the sauce. Once the mixture starts to simmer, add the beef and any juices from the bowl along with the rest of the scallions. Stir-fry everything to combine.
Immediately stir up your cornstarch slurry (the water and cornstarch has likely separated by now). Slowly drizzle about two thirds of the slurry into the sauce while stirring.
Within 10 seconds, you should see the sauce thicken. Add more cornstarch slurry if you like your sauce thicker, or add more stock or water if the sauce is too thick. (Remember your sauce will thicken slightly as it cools.) Either way, move quickly during this step so you don’t overcook your beef. Turn the heat off as soon as the sauce is to your desired consistency.
At this point, if you like a little extra richness and the combination of soy sauce and butter, stir in a tablespoon of butter just before plating the dish!

Rinse the steak under cold water and pat dry with paper towels. Sprinkle on all sides with salt and pepper, to taste. Heat your grill to the max heat--that means at least three of the burners on full blast high, and keeping the lid closed for a good 5-10 minutes.
Mix the melted butter together with the soy sauce in a small bowl. When the grill is heated, put the steak on the grill, letting it brown for about 1-2 minutes. You can close the grill lid to let the heat build up and get some nice caramelization on the edges of the steak. After 1-2 minutes, turn the steak 45 degrees to get those pretty grill marks. Let cook again for 1-2 minutes. Flip the steak and repeat the above steps for the other side.
When the steak is pretty well-browned on both sides, use your tongs lift up the steak and brown the edges. Thick cut steaks need TLC on the edges too! Now for the soy-butter glaze. Liberally brush the steak with the soy-butter mixture using a heat-proof basting brush. Flip the steak and brush the other side. You may want to wear an oven mitt for this process, as the butter may cause some fairly strong flame-ups. The glaze will make the steak perfectly caramelized and charred on the outside! Those grill marks we worked on earlier add the perfect uniformity of char and color!
Liberally glaze the steak continuously until it's cooked to your preferred doneness--rare, medium-rare, medium, etc; this translates to grilling the steak for an additional 3-5 minutes for medium-rare, 5-7 minutes for medium, or 8-10 minutes for medium-well, though this does depend on steak thickness. A better test for doneness is to poke the steak gently with the tongs. The squishier it is, the rarer your steak will be. More firm means more well-done. Simple right?
Remove the steak from the heat and let rest for 10-15 minutes. It's a long time, we know, but it'll all be worth it when you cut into your steak and skip the lake of beef juice that escapes onto your cutting board!
Serve with additional soy-butter glaze on the side (you can make a fresh batch or reheat what you used to baste the steak--remember that you basted the steak once it was cooked on the outside, so it's safe to consume post-grilling).",en-US,5.0,,The Woks of Life,20,2 serving(s),,,,,,,,,,,,

Once the water is boiling, add the beef. Let it come back up to a boil, and boil for 1 minute. Strain in a colander and rinse thoroughly with fresh water to remove any impurities.
Next, in your instant pot, turn on the saute setting. Add the oil, crushed ginger, garlic, scallions, and onions in that order. Stir to lightly caramelize. Let the onion turn translucent. Add the tomato and dried chilies.
Next, add the meat to the pot. Then add the tomato paste, spicy bean paste, sugar, soy sauce, and Shaoxing wine, and mix thoroughly.
Pour 8 cups of water into the instant pot. Add the spice packet. The instant pot should be filled to the 10-cup line; it shouldn’t be more than ⅔ of the way full per safety instructions. Our instant pot is the largest size (8 quarts); if yours is smaller, you can halve the recipe accordingly.
Close the lid of the instant pot, and make sure you have your vent set so it is not venting. Cook for 100 minutes on the aromatic meat stew setting. If you don’t have an instant pot, you can use a regular pot on the stove, but instead, cook the soup on a low simmer for 3-4 hours.

In a mixing bowl, add the melted lard or shortening, flour, and hot water. Mix it until it comes together into a smooth ball of dough, adding a little more flour if necessary (depending on the humidity in your kitchen). Refrigerate the dough for one hour.
Next, make the filling. Heat the oil in a frying pan over medium high heat. Brown the ground beef. Add the onion and garlic and cook until translucent. Next, add the Spanish olives, the chili peppers, the sun-dried tomato, the spices, sugar, and salt. Stir to combine, and let cook for an additional few minutes.
Add the water and bring to a boil. Add the tomato paste, stirring the entire mixture thoroughly to dissolve it, and let cook until the water has cooked off and the filling has thickened. Remove from the heat and cool completely.
Next, prep your dough! On a clean, floured work surface, roll the dough into a 1/8-inch layer. Using a round cookie cutter (or cup/bowl) in the size of your choice (you could make teeny tiny finger food empanadas instead of the bigger ones we made!), cut out as many rounds as you can. Peel away the spare dough and transfer back into the refrigerator.
For each empanada, spoon filling into the middle of the dough and top with a generous amount of cheese, ensuring you have enough margin around the edge of the dough to fold it over and seal the empanada. You can also stretch the dough out a bit into an oval shape and put the filling on one half of the dough, to make the folding process easier. Fold in half and crimp the edges, either with a fork, or if you want to be fancy, with a traditional twisting technique. (YouTube is your friend!) Repeat these steps with all of the dough rounds, and repeat the rolling out & cutting process until there is no leftover dough.
If you are baking the empanadas, heat your oven to 400 degrees. Brush the empanadas with oil prior to baking, and bake for 10-15 minutes. If you are frying the empanadas, heat a small, deep pot with enough oil to submerge a couple empanadas. Heat the oil to 350 degrees, and fry the empanadas until golden brown, in small batches of 2-3 (depending on the size of your pot and your empanadas). When they’re cooked through, transfer to a wire rack or a plate lined with a paper towel to drain.

Set aside.
For the rest of the dish, combine the oyster sauce, sugar, Thai soy sauce, Thai black soy sauce, fish sauce, and white pepper in a small bowl. Stir to mix well.
Make sure your fresh rice noodles are at room temperature. If the noodles are really cold and stiff from refrigeration, rinse them quickly under hot tap water when you are ready to stir-fry the dish. This extra step will help you avoid a big homogenous lump of noodles during stir-frying. Be sure to shake off any excess water after rinsing and use them immediately.
The fresh wide rice noodles really set this dish apart from other noodle dishes, so try your best to find them. Or you can use our recipe for homemade rice noodles to make them at home. If either of these options don’t work, then use dried rice noodles. If using a dried rice noodle, follow the directions on the package and make sure you undercook the noodles slightly (al dente), since you will be cooking them again in the wok. After you drain the noodles thoroughly, toss the noodles with a tablespoon of oil. This will prevent them from sticking to the wok.
Heat your wok over high heat until it just starts to smoke, and spread 1 tablespoon of oil around the perimeter of the wok evenly to coat. Sear the beef until it is 80% cooked through, and transfer back to the marinade bowl.
Add another tablespoon of oil to the wok and stir in the garlic. Immediately add the Chinese broccoli and stir-fry for 20 seconds (stir constantly to prevent the garlic from burning).
Next, spread the noodles around the wok. Continue to work quickly--your wok should be at the highest heat setting. Spread the sauce mixture over the top of the noodles, and gently mix everything with your wok spatula using a scooping motion for about 20 seconds. Add the beef back to wok.
Push the mixture to one side to let the empty side of the wok heat for 10 seconds. Add another tablespoon of oil to the wok, and add the beaten eggs. Wait 5 seconds for them to begin to cook. Scramble the eggs for another few seconds, breaking them up into smaller pieces.
If your wok is not sizzling at this point, it probably means that your burner is not hot enough. Be patient, and the heat should “catch up.” Stir-fry the mixture just enough so the noodles heat up evenly, but don’t break into small pieces. Make sure you use your wok spatula to scrape the bottom of the wok so the noodles don’t stick.
As the wok heats up, you will notice that the food will stick to it less readily! But if you need to, you can add a little oil to make it easier to stir-fry.
Continue cooking, stirring less frequently (so the noodles get slightly caramelized, creating that restaurant-style flavor) for another 1 to 2 minutes, or until the noodles are heated through.

You’ll have plenty of chimichurri to go with it.))']","Pick the leaves off your bunch of parsley, and finely chop them. Peel all your garlic cloves and mince finely. You can use a food processor, garlic press, or an old fashioned knife and cutting board.
In a small bowl, combine the parsley, oregano, red wine vinegar, garlic, oil, red pepper flakes, salt, black pepper, and lime juice. Stir well to combine
Fire up your grill to preheat. Season your steak with salt and pepper. When your grill is extremely hot (if you have a thermometer on your grill, it should be in the range of 500-600F), lay the steaks on the grill. Skirt steaks are very thin, so this process will be quick. Do not close the grill, and don’t walk away!
When the first side has been on the grill for about 1 minute, rotate the steaks to get some solid grill marks. After another minute, flip the steak, letting cook for 1 minute, then rotating, then letting cook for another minute or two. Once you’ve established a solid criss-cross, you can start moving around a little bit more erratically. This will ensure that you get a delicious uniform grill crust--none of that fakey McFakerson neat criss cross lame-ness you see in Outback Steakhouse commercials. These instructions are for medium rare, which is in our opinion the best way to enjoy your steak. If you like it more or less well done, add or subtract cooking time.
When the steak is cooked, transfer to a plate and let rest for a solid 10 minutes. Don’t cut into it before then. Serve as large steaks or slice against the grain and top with generous amounts of chimichurri.",en-US,5.0,,The Woks of Life,30,12 serving(s),,,,,,,,,,,,

After the bok choy is cooked and wilted (about 60 seconds or so), add the salt, sugar and MSG (if using). Mix thoroughly, transfer to a warm serving plate, and set aside. MSG is totally optional, but it really brings out the flavor of stir-fried vegetables.
Work quickly through these next steps, because your stir-fried bok choy is waiting to be topped with your delicious steak! Carefully rinse your wok with warm water, drain, and wipe off any excess moisture. Place the wok back over the burner set to high heat. Spread ½ tablespoon vegetable oil around the perimeter of the wok.
Once the wok begins to smoke, add the steak in a single layer, fat-side down for any pieces with visible fat.
Sear for 30 seconds or until brown. Use your wok spatula to toss everything together to ensure even cooking and browning, but resist the temptation to stir too much. High heat is essential to ensure you have a good sear and maximum flavor. I like to sear the steak until cooked medium / medium rare, which is why this steak stir fry recipe calls for large 1-inch chunks of steak.
Once done to your liking, turn off the heat, and scoop the steak over the bok choy to rest. (If any liquid has pooled on the bok choy plate, pour the excess off before adding the beef.)
You’ll need at least 1-2 tablespoons of the residual oil in the wok. Pour off any excess and discard. This is pure beef flavor that will make your sauce taste that much better. Turn the wok back up to medium-high heat. Pour the prepared steak sauce into the wok, using it to deglaze the wok. If you want more sauce, you can add some additional water—bonus if you use the water from the bok choy plate, which has a nice ginger and garlic flavor.
When the sauce is simmering, stir up the cornstarch slurry and drizzle it into the sauce, letting it thicken until it coats a spoon. Simmer for an additional 20 seconds to ensure the cornstarch is cooked. Turn the heat off, pour the sauce over your steak, and serve immediately with steamed rice.",en-US,5.0,,The Woks of Life,60,4 serving(s),1 serving,344 kcal,6 g,24 g,25 g,14 g,69 mg,778 mg,2 g,1 g,,

Be sure to cut the beef against the grain. If you’re knife skills are not that good, place the beef into the freezer until it is firm but not frozen; slicing the beef will be much easier!
Add 1 teaspoon each of cornstarch, oil, and soy sauce to the beef in a bowl. Use your hands to massage these ingredients into the beef and set aside to marinate for 20 minutes.
After the beef has marinated, heat a wok over high heat. Add a tablespoon of oil. When the oil starts to smoke, sear the beef for 30-60 seconds, just until browned. Remove from the wok and set aside. Add 2 more tablespoons of oil to the wok along with the ginger. Let the ginger caramelize for 15 seconds. Add the garlic and Chinese broccoli, and stir-fry for 1 minute, making sure the vegetables are cooking evenly. The Chinese broccoli will start turning a bright green.
Add the beef, oyster sauce, soy sauce, salt, sugar, sesame oil and hot chicken stock and stir-fry until mixed thoroughly. (Use hot chicken stock so you don’t kill the stir-fry party going on in the wok by reducing the temperature of the ingredients. Nothing worse than adding cold chicken stock and then having to wait minutes for the liquid to get back to a boiling, sizzling state.)
Once the liquid comes to a boil, push the beef and vegetables away from the middle of the wok and stir in the cornstarch slurry gradually to thicken the sauce. Use only what you need!

The baking soda will help to tenderize the beef. Then “wash” the beef under running water for 5 minutes, using a light to moderate stream of water so it flows out, but the beef stays in the bowl. After the beef has been rinsed, pour out the water, and marinate the beef with two teaspoons of cornstarch. Set aside.
Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in your wok over high heat. Stir fry the bean sprouts for about 2 minutes, then add the Enoki mushrooms. Stir and mix everything well until the mushrooms have wilted. Turn off the heat, pick a large serving bowl with some depth, and spread the bean sprouts and Enoki mushrooms around the bottom of the bowl.
Now wash the wok. It’s important to start the next step with a clean wok!
Heat a ¼ cup of oil in the wok over medium heat. Cook the ginger slices until they start to turn light brown. Add the scallions and the Sichuan peppercorns. Cook for two minutes, making sure to avoid burning the spices. Now add the spicy bean sauce/paste, stir, and let the sauce cook in the oil for about 3-4 minutes. This will give the oil a bright red color. It’s important to control the heat––too low and the oil won't turn that vibrant red color; too high and you’ll burn everything!
Once the oil takes on a bright red color, add the stock and sugar. Turn up the heat to high, stirring, and let the liquid come to a boil. Immediately add the beef, and stir slowly to separate the pieces, still using high heat. Quickly turn off the heat once all the beef pieces turn opaque. (You don’t have to cook the beef completely through––a hint of pink in the middle equals tender beef.) Now, pour everything over the vegetables in the bottom of your serving bowl.
Top it with the minced garlic, chili flakes, and chopped cilantro. In a small saucepan, heat the last 3 tablespoons of oil until shimmering. Pour the heated oil over the garlic and chili in a very thin stream––you should get a good sizzle.

The dough should be sticky, but should also come together in a ball. Coat the dough with 1 teaspoon of vegetable oil and cover with plastic wrap so it is completely sealed. Allow to rest for 1 hour.
After the dough has rested, ready the other ingredients--this will be the filling of the Ji Dan Bing. Next, divide the dough into four equal portions, drizzling additional vegetable oil on the dough and your hands to prevent it from sticking. The dough will be less sticky after resting, but it should still be quite moist.
Next, lightly coat your rolling surface and rolling pin with oil, but if you feel things sticking. Most street vendors use a stainless steel surface like you see in the video, but a marble or granite countertop or wooden cutting board will also work nicely.
Use a standard non-tapered rolling pin for this recipe, and roll the dough out into a thin layer until it is almost translucent.
Heat a large skillet or frying pan over medium-high heat. Add 1 teaspoon of oil, which should thin out and spread out easily on the skillet when it is added. The skillet should not be smoking, however!
Lift the rolled out dough in one steady motion and place it in the pan, doing your best to lay it down in one even layer. The dough should sizzle in the skillet to indicate that your pan is hot enough.
Immediately crack one egg in the center of the dough. Lightly beat the egg with a few strokes using a fork or your spatula, spreading it across the dough. There is no need to meticulously try to cover the entire area of the dough, and don’t worry if the egg overflows either. The dough and egg will become one!
Drizzle another teaspoon of oil on top of your Ji Dan Bing. Flip it, and let the egg side cook for about 10 seconds, then flip it again. Let the Ji Dan Bing cook for another minute, or until parts of it are golden brown, and transfer to a cutting board or plate, egg side up.
Spread any combination of sweet bean, hot bean sauce, and hot chili oil on the Ji Dan Bing. Sprinkle toasted sesame seeds on top, along with scallions and cilantro--if using.

Stir to dissolve the sugar. Once it’s boiled, add the lemon juice, stir, and immediately turn the heat down to low. Keep the lid off, and let the syrup simmer for about 60 to 70 minutes until the sugary liquid turns a light amber color. Do not stir during this time frame! By now, the liquid might look too watery, but it will thicken once it’s cooled. Try not to overcook it, because it will become thick like caramel (it should be the consistency of honey). Just in case you do overcook the syrup, and it’s too thick, add a few drops of hot water to thin it out. Keep adding the hot water until you get the right consistency. Now pour the sugary liquid into a heatproof container, and let it cool completely before storing it in the refrigerator.
Making the Lotus Paste: Using a butter knife, gently split the lotus seeds in half through the top opening. Remove and discard the green center. Wash and soak them overnight. The next day, wash and drain the lotus seeds. In a pot, add the lotus seeds and 4 cups of water (the water level should be above the lotus seeds). Bring the mixture to a boil over high heat. Once the water reaches a boil, turn the heat to low, and let the seeds simmer for 30 minutes. It’s done once the lotus seeds are softened but have maintained their shape. Turn off the heat, let cool, and then drain the liquid. In a food processor, puree the cooked lotus seeds (it’s best to do this in two batches). Transfer the lotus puree to a non-stick pan (or a cast-iron pan, or a pan with a thick bottom to avoid sticking and burning). Turn the heat to medium low, and stir/flip/turn the puree using a rubber spatula non-stop for about 30 minutes (nice to have the TV or an audiobook on as you're doing this). In between, add in the powdered sugar and oil in 3 alternating batches. With each batch, make sure the sugar and oil is well incorporated before adding more. The lotus filling is done once the lotus paste is slightly firmer/can hold its shape. Let it cool completely before storing in the refrigerator in an airtight container. You can make this one day ahead of time, and I found that it’s easier to work with when the filling has been chilled.
Making the salted duck egg yolks: There are a couple of ways to go about preparing the salted duck egg yolk: The ones I bought are already cooked, so they were ready to use, and you can buy the same. But I did find them to be slightly drier than I would normally like. You can also buy whole cooked salted duck eggs, and extract the whole yolk. You can buy raw salted duck eggs, crack the eggs open, and take out the yolks. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Dip each yolk in baijiu (白酒, a clear Chinese liquor made from grain), just briefly to coat it, then put the egg yolks on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake for 8 minutes, let them cool completely, and they are ready to use. You can also prepare this ahead of time...just make sure to store them in an airtight container and in the fridge.
Making the dough: First mix the sugar syrup, oil, and lye water together. Then add the mixture to the flour, and use a rubber spatula to fold and combine everything into a soft dough. Do not overwork the dough--this step should only take about a minute or two. Cover the dough in an airtight container or wrap in plastic wrap. Let it rest in the refrigerator for an hour. Chilled dough is much easier to work with. (Side note: you may also leave the dough in the refrigerator overnight if you'd like to make it ahead of time.)
Assembling the mooncakes: While the dough is resting, let’s start assembling the filling. My mooncake mold was marked 100 grams, which means each mooncake should weigh about 100 grams after assembly. This recipe makes 18 mooncakes total: 12 mooncakes with salted duck egg yolks and 6 mooncakes without. Separately weigh out twelve 58-gram scoops of lotus filling and six 70-gram scoops of lotus filling. Shape each portion of filling into balls. Next, take one of the 58 gram lotus balls, make a deep well in the middle, and insert one salted duck egg yolk into the middle. Then close the top and re-shape it into a ball. Repeat for the remaining 11 pieces. It’s good to separate the “with” and the “without.” It’s also a good idea to put them back into the refrigerator, covered, until you are ready to assemble the rest of the mooncakes. Once the dough has finished resting, it’s time to prepare the mooncake mold. My mooncake mold came with four pattern plates––one plate should be attached to the mold itself. Wrap another one with clear plastic, because we will use it to press the mooncake from the bottom;, Now dust the inside of the mold with plenty of flour and shake off the excess. You’ll need to repeat this process before pressing every mooncake to avoid sticking. Divide and weigh the dough into eighteen 25-gram pieces, plus 1 smaller dough ball for scraps/mending, which I will get to. Shape each piece into a ball. Lightly dust the dough balls with flour. Take one dough ball and roll it out on a lightly floured surface into a 4-inch round. Put one piece of filling in the center. Carefully lift it up and turn it upside down, and gently press out the air bubbles around the lotus ball, without breaking the dough. Now turn the opening facing up, and slowly press the dough together to close the opening, keeping the distribution of the dough as even as possible. The dough feels like Play-doh, so it’s easy to break, but it’s also easy to squish back together. These instructions might sound confusing, but follow along with the pictures and keep in mind that the chief goal here is to close the dough around the filling without capturing air inside. Now lightly dust the assembled ball with additional flour. Place it inside the mooncake mold with the mold opening facing up. Now press in the bottom piece (with the clear plastic-wrapped plate that you prepared). With some pressure, gently press it inward. Quickly sit the mold down, and press the mooncake out with the top pressure bar. The bottom piece will come out no problem, but use your other hand to VERY GENTLY guide the mooncake out of the mold. When and if a small piece of dough gets stuck and does not come out, get a small piece of the “scrap”/“mending” dough to patch up the area. Then clean the mold and dust it well with flour again. Then gently flatten all sides of the mooncake to make it smaller, so it can go back in the mooncake mold for re-shaping. Use slightly more flour for dusting if this becomes a persistent issue. Place the mooncakes on a baking sheet as you make them.
Baking the mooncakes: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees when you are almost finished assembling the mooncakes. Once the oven is preheated, gently mist the mooncakes with a food-grade spray bottle (if you have one) filled with water. But since I didn’t have one, I just used my fingers, and it worked fine! Dip your fingers into a bowl of water, and fling the water on your fingers onto the mooncakes a couple of times. This prevents the dough from cracking. Then, immediately put the mooncakes in the oven and bake for 5 minutes. (Remember to set the timer!) Now prepare the egg wash by whisking the egg yolk and water together. After the mooncakes have been baking for 5 minutes, take them out of the oven and immediately lower the oven temperature to 300 degrees. Now lightly brush each mooncake with egg wash, and put them back in the oven. Bake them for another 15 minutes and remember to set the timer. When the time has elapsed, take them out and let them cool completely.
When the mooncakes first come out of the oven, the dough looks dry like bread, and not oily like what you are used to when opening packaged mooncakes. This is normal. Store the cooled mooncakes in an airtight container for a day or two, and the outside will get that nice shiny sheen that you recognize and love.
After this last step, any uneaten mooncakes can be kept in the refrigerator for a week or two.",en-US,4.85,,The Woks of Life,840,18 serving(s),1 serving,308 kcal,51 g,6 g,9 g,2 g,141 mg,16 mg,29 g,1 g,,

Add ¼ cup oil to the wok and heat over medium-high heat. Add the ginger and fry until fragrant (the color will darken, but the ginger will not necessarily become crisp). Next, add the garlic. It should be lightly toasted; if it’s still white in color, it needs more cooking time. In total, it will take about 10 minutes time to cook the ginger and garlic.
Next, turn the heat up to high and add the rice to the wok. Stir-fry the rice so the ginger/garlic mixture is evenly distributed. Spread the rice out in one layer so it can evenly toast.

This is a simple dish, but things move quickly once the heat is on, so be prepared. Pour the oil into a nonstick pan over medium heat.

This will give the soup that rich restaurant-style yellow color, but it is optional. Taste the soup, and adjust the seasoning if needed.
Next add the cornstarch and water mixture. Make sure the cornstarch and water is mixed well, as the cornstarch settles very quickly. Stir the soup continuously as you drizzle in the slurry, or you'll get clumps of cooked starch in your soup. Use more or less starch if you like a thicker or thinner soup. You can also add the starch in a couple small batches, let the soup simmer for a couple of minutes, then check to see if the consistency is to your liking.
Now we're ready for the most exciting part: the egg. This recipe calls for the egg to be lightly beaten, which results in both white and yellow egg swirls. The speed at which you stir the soup when adding the egg also determines whether you get large “egg flowers” or small egg flowers (i.e. swirly bits of egg).

Carefully arrange the eggs in the container they’ll be brined in. Add enough water to cover the eggs so they are completely submerged. This step is to find out how much water you need, so do not discard the water.
Carefully remove the eggs from the water, and let them sunbathe for 3-4 hours in the early morning sun; reduce the sunbathing time to 1-2 hours if the temperature is higher than 65F, but it should still be early morning sun! Turn the eggs every hour. The late morning hot sun may result in cracked eggs during the salting process.
Meanwhile, transfer the water in the container to a clean pot—I used about 1 quart of water (if you’re using aromatics, it’s time to add them now!). Stir in ¼ cup salt and bring to a boil. Turn off the heat, cover, and cool completely to room temperature. In the meantime, take the container, and let it dry out completely in the sun.
Pour ½ cup of Chinese baijiu (or whiskey) into a large bowl, carefully take the eggs, and turn them over in the baijiu. ½ cup of baijiu isn’t enough to submerge them, so you’ll have to roll them around every 10 minutes so they are soaking at all times. Soak the eggs in the baijiu for 1 hour.
Once the salt water is completely cooled and your container is dry, add the eggs back to the glass container one by one. Pour in the baijiu used to soak the eggs along with the cooled salt water. Arrange the eggs with a clean utensil to make sure they are all completely submerged.
Cover tightly so that the container is thoroughly sealed, and store in a cool, dry place for 30 to 60 days. Egg sizes vary, so brining time will vary as well. You can cook one after 30 days to see if it’s done. Try again in 10-15 days if it's not quite there!

Meanwhile, in a medium pot, bring 7 cups of water to a boil. Add the frozen rice (no need to defrost) and bring it to a boil again, stirring the rice to prevent sticking. Reduce the heat to a low simmer, and cover and cook for about 15 minutes. Periodically check and stir the congee. It’s important to stir from the bottom to prevent sticking, as the rice texture thickens quickly.
While that’s cooking, dice the thousand year-old egg and set it aside. Very thinly julienne the ginger. Don’t prepare this ahead of time, as we want the flavor of freshly cut ginger.
After 15 minutes, it’s time to add the julienned ginger, pork, and thousand year-old egg. Stir and simmer for another 5 minutes or so. Finally, stir in the white pepper and salt to taste. Serve piping hot with chopped scallions and cilantro.

Bring another pot of water to a boil for the eggs. Once boiling, gently and quickly lower the eggs into the boiling water using a large spoon. You want to avoid dropping them and cracking them on the bottom of the pot. Let the eggs cook in the boiling water for 7 minutes (it’s a good idea to set a timer). Once the timer goes off, turn off the heat, quickly scoop out the eggs, and transfer to an ice bath. Allow them to sit in the ice bath until they are completely cool to the touch. The purpose here is to stop cooking the eggs any further.
Once the eggs are cooled, lightly crack the egg shells. The goal here is to make enough cracks to allow the flavor of the sauce base to seep into the egg. I like to use a small spoon to tap the eggs, but be careful! It you tap or crack too hard, you might crack open the egg since the egg yolk is still very soft.
Soak the cracked eggs in your sauce base for 24 hours in the refrigerator, making sure all the eggs are completely submerged in the sauce base. After 24 hours, they’re ready!

Add the scallions and toasted sesame seeds to the batter, and mix until evenly distributed. Let the batter sit for 5 minutes.
Heat your waffle iron to the highest setting, and once it’s hot, pour enough batter in to cover. Most waffle irons are non-stick and do not require any additional oil, but if you have an old cast iron one, you can brush the iron with some oil or melted butter, especially if you want an extra crispy waffle.
How much batter you use for each sesame scallion waffle and the length of time the waffle needs to cook depends upon the waffle iron you are using, but you will know what to do after you make the first one. Most Belgian waffle makers can accommodate about ¾ cup of batter per waffle and will take 6 minutes to cook up a brown and crispy waffle. When the steam subsides, you can be pretty confident that your waffle is done.
If you have a waffle iron that flips, flip it once after you have poured in the batter and once more halfway through the cooking – or about 3 minutes. Check your waffle after 6 minutes and let it cook longer if you like your waffles darker and crunchier. Flipping helps to release the steam from the batter makes your sesame scallion waffles crispier. You can make adjustments as needed according to your setup!
Take the waffle out of the iron when done, taking care not to burn yourself because they are really hot.

Add the butter and break it up roughly with your fingers, making sure to keep visible little chunks of butter in the dough. Add 2 tablespoons of cold water and bring the dough together. Add a tiny bit more water if necessary, but not too much. Cover the dough and refrigerate for 20 minutes.
Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured board, knead gently, and form into a neat rectangle. Roll the dough away from you (not back and forth), forming a 20 x 50cm rectangle (about 8x20 inches). Try to keep the edges even, and don’t overwork the butter streaks. Flecks of butter should still be visible in the dough.
Fold the top third of the dough down to the center, then the bottom third up and over that. Give the dough a quarter turn (left or right) and roll out again to three times the length. Fold the same way as before, cover, and chill for 30 minutes.
While the dough is resting, make the filling. Dissolve 1/2 cup sugar into the cup of hot water, and allow to cool to room temperature. Whisk eggs and evaporated milk together and then thoroughly whisk in the sugar water and vanilla. Strain through a very fine mesh strainer--this step is extremely important to getting a smooth, glassy egg tart.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F/200 degrees C and position a rack in the lower third of your oven. Roll out the dough and cut circles to fit your tins (you can also use a shallow muffin pan). Press the dough into the tins and use a ladle to fill each tart shell until just reaching the edges of the outside crust. Once filled, immediately (but very carefully) transfer the pan to the oven and bake for 15 minutes. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F/180 degrees C and bake another 10-12 minutes, until filling is just set (if a toothpick can stand up in it, it’s done).

While that's happening, make the filling. Heat your wok or cast iron pan over medium-high heat and add the oil, onions and tofu. Cook for 3-5 minutes until one side of the tofu is just browned. Turn the mixture over with a rubber spatula and brown the other side. Feel free to add more oil if the mixture looks a bit dry.
Add the soy sauces, sugar, salt, sesame oil, hoisin sauce, and white pepper. Stir everything together and then add the water/vegetable stock and flour. Stir gently so as not to break up the tofu chunks.
Let the mixture simmer until the liquid thickens into a sauce. It should thicken further as it cools. Set the mixture aside to cool completely before making the buns. If the mixture looks a little wet, you can put it in the fridge to solidify it for easier assembly.
Once the dough has proofed for an hour, turn it out onto a well-floured surface and knead for another 2-3 minutes to ensure most of the air bubbles are gone. Add just enough flour so you can knead it, but be careful not to dry out the dough. Divide the dough into 10 equal pieces and cover with a damp towel.
Roll out each dough ball into a disc, where the middle of the disc is a bit thicker than the sides. Put about 2 tablespoons of filling in the center and fold up the edges to close the bun.

You can use our recipe for sweet red bean paste, or opt for store-bought. Our original recipe makes a large batch, but you can freeze leftovers to make other recipes. To make the exact amount needed for this recipe, scale the serving size down from 21 to 4 in the recipe card. The filling must be cooled completely and can be made up to several days in advance.
In a large mixing bowl, add 1 teaspoon sugar to ¼ cup warm water, and stir in the yeast until dissolved. Let sit for 15 minutes until the yeast foams up.
Next, stir in the milk and add the flour, powdered sugar, and salt. With the dough hook attachment, turn the mixer on low. Let the mixer go for 5 minutes, or knead by hand for 8 minutes, or until the dough is soft and smooth. The dough should not stick to your hands or the bowl.
Cover with a plate to proof for 1 hour in a warm spot, or until the dough doubles in size. I proof the dough inside my closed microwave with a large mug of just boiled water next to it.
While the dough is proofing, roll 8 balls of red bean filling between your palms. Each should weigh about 25g. Cover them with a damp towel to prevent them from drying out. Set aside.
Cut out eight 3""x 3"" squares of parchment paper for the buns to sit on in the steamer.
Once the dough is done proofing, put it back in the mixer and knead for another 2 to 3 minutes to get rid of any air bubbles (or knead by hand). Transfer to a clean, lightly floured surface. Use a kitchen scale to equally divide the dough into 8 pieces (mine were 50g apiece). Cover with a clean kitchen towel while you assemble the buns.
To assemble, roll a dough ball into a 4-inch disc, making the edges slightly thinner than the center. Put one ball of red bean filling in the center of the dough. Gather the edges of the dough around the filling, and pinch the edges together to close the opening.
Place the dough seam side down on a parchment square, and transfer to your steaming rack. The buns need at least 1-inch of space between each other. Repeat with the remaining dough until all the buns are assembled.
Prepare your steamer with about 5 cups of warm water. Put the buns in the steamer and cover. Your steamer water should be lukewarm to help with proofing, but do not turn on the heat at this time. Let them proof for 30 minutes.
Now turn the heat on to medium/high. Set your timer for 15 minutes, during which the heat will slowly bring the water to a boil and steam the buns. It may seem slow to heat in the beginning, but don’t be tempted to disturb the buns or remove the lid.
After the 15-minutes have elapsed, turn off the heat, and let the buns sit in the steamer with the lid tightly covered for another 5 minutes. DO NOT UNCOVER THE LID AT ANY POINT DURING THE STEAMING AND POST-STEAMING TIME. The buns need 5 minutes to set, or they will collapse and become wrinkly, so be patient.

If you don't have a mixer and would like to knead by hand, extend the kneading time by 5-10 minutes.
After 15 minutes of mixing, the dough is ready for proofing. Cover the bowl with a damp towel and place in a warm spot for 1 hour. The dough will grow to 1.5X its original size.
Meanwhile, prepare your filling and topping. To make the filling, heat 2 tablespoons oil in a wok over medium high heat. Add the onion and stir-fry for 2 minutes. Add the sugar, soy sauce, oyster sauce, sesame oil, and dark soy. Stir and cook until it starts to bubble up. Add the water and flour. Reduce the heat to medium low and cook, stirring, for a couple minutes until thickened. Remove from the heat and stir in the roast pork. Set aside to cool.
To prepare the topping, add the dry milk powder to a mixing bowl. If your dry milk powder has some larger clumps, crush them up with your fingers so it’s uniformly powdery. Add the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and superfine sugar. Stir to combine. Add the shortening, milk, egg yolk, and vanilla. Use your hands to mix everything together into a dough. If it’s too dry, add a little more milk a teaspoon at a time until it comes together. Cover with an overturned bowl or plate, and set aside at room temperature.
After the hour of proofing, put the dough back in the mixer and stir for another 5 minutes to get rid of air bubbles. You can also knead by hand. Dump the dough onto a lightly floured surface, and cut it into 18 equal pieces.
To assemble, divide the topping mixture into 18 equal pieces and roll each into a ball. Roll each ball out into a flat circle using a rolling pin.
Take a piece of bread dough, and flatten with your hands into a rough circle. Put a heaping tablespoon of pork filling in the middle, and wrap the dough around it.

Turn the mixer on to the lowest setting (or stir with a wooden spoon), and mix until a dough forms. Knead the dough on the lowest setting for 15 minutes, occasionally stopping the mixer to push the dough together. The dough should pull away from the sides of the bowl, but stick to the bottom of the mixing bowl. If kneading by hand, extend the kneading time by 5-10 minutes.
If you’re in a humid climate and the dough is sticking to the sides of the bowl, add a little more flour 1 tablespoon at a time until it pulls away from the sides. Avoid adding too much additional flour, or the bread will be dense and less fluffy.
Cover the bowl with a damp towel and place in a warm spot for 60-90 minutes, or until doubled in size.
While the dough is proofing, cook the bacon on both sides, until crisp but still pliable. Cool and chop into ½ inch pieces. Prepare the scallions by washing them, wiping them thoroughly dry, and finely chopping them. Thoroughly grease an 8-inch or 9-inch round cake pan with butter or oil.
After the dough has doubled in size, punch the air out of it and knead for 5 minutes. Form it into a round ball, and roll it out into a ¼ inch (0.66 cm) thick rectangle or rough circle. Sprinkle the scallions and bacon evenly over the dough, and cut it into small 1.5 inch (4 cm) squares.
Fold each square in half like a taco with the bacon scallion filling on the inside. Nestle them in the pan standing up on one end of the taco. At this point, you can cover and refrigerate the dough overnight, if making this recipe in advance. The next day, remove the dough from the refrigerator, let it come up to room temperature, and proceed with the next step.
Proof the dough for 1 hour. Towards the end of the proofing process, place a rack in the center of your oven and preheat it to 350°F/175°C.

Shape the dough into a ball, and cover the bowl with an overturned plate or damp towel. Place in a warm spot to proof for 75-90 minutes, or until the dough doubles in size. (A good proofing environment is a closed microwave, with a mug of hot boiled water next to the bowl.)
While that's happening, mix the filling. In a medium bowl, combine the coconut, milk powder, sugar, salt, melted butter, egg yolks, and milk. Set aside.
After the first proof, knead for another 5 minutes to punch the air out of it. Then dump the dough on a lightly floured surface, shape it into a ball, and cut it in half. Cut each half of dough into 6 pieces, so you get 12 equal pieces of dough.
To shape the buns, knead and roll piece of dough into an even ball, and flatten. Roll into a 5x10 inch rectangle. Spread a layer of filling onto the rectangle, pressing the filling into the dough and leaving about a half inch of margin all around.
Roll the dough lengthwise into a cigar. Cut the cigar in half lengthwise, leaving it attached at the top end, so it looks like a long pair of pants. Twist the two pieces together, and then roll into a round spiral/snail shape, tucking the ends underneath the bun. Place onto a parchment-lined baking sheet.

Next, add the dark brown sugar, regular sugar, mashed fermented bean curd, and five-spice powder. Slowly stir in the water to form a wet dough. Make sure everything is well-combined. Cover and let the dough rest for 15 minutes.
While the dough is resting, take a medium pot and fill it with about 1 inch of oil for frying. Set aside. Once the dough is rested, dust a clean surface with a good amount of flour, and scrape the dough onto the floured surface. The dough will be very wet, so flour both hands before handling the dough.

Start with the room temperature heavy cream, milk, and egg. Then add the sugar, cake flour, bread flour, yeast, and salt, in that order.
Turn the mixer on to the lowest setting to bring the dough together. When a scraggly dough has formed, knead on low speed for 15 minutes. If needed, turn off the mixer to bring the dough together with a rubber spatula. Alternatively, you can stir all the dough ingredients together with a wooden spoon in a large mixing bowl, and then knead by hand for 20 minutes.
The dough should stick to the bottom of the bowl, but should not stick to the sides. If you’re in a humid climate, and the dough is sticking to the sides of the mixing bowl, add more flour 1 tablespoon at a time until it comes together.
Shape the dough into a ball, and cover with an overturned plate or damp towel. Place in a warm spot to proof for 75-90 minutes, or until the dough doubles in size. (A good proofing environment is a closed microwave, with a mug of hot boiled water next to the bowl.)
While that’s happening, make the meat filling. Be sure to dice the pork finely rather than in large chunks, so the buns are easier to fill. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a wok over medium heat. Add the shallot/onion and stir-fry for 2 minutes. Add the sugar, soy sauce, oyster sauce, sesame oil, and dark soy. Stir and cook until it begins to bubble. Add the chicken stock and flour. Reduce the heat to medium low and cook, stirring, for 2-3 minutes, until thickened. Stir in the roast pork.
Turn off the heat, and remove the filling from the wok onto a large plate. Separate the filling into 16 roughly equal piles, to ensure you get an even amount in each bun. Set aside to cool.
After the first proof, knead the dough for another 5 minutes to punch the air out. Dump it onto a lightly floured surface, and shape it into a ball.
Cut it into 16 equal pieces (in half, then quarters, then in quarters again). The best way to ensure you get evenly sized buns is to weigh the entire dough ball, divide the weight by 16, and then weigh out each individual piece to match that weight.
To shape the buns, knead each individual dough ball to punch out any air bubbles and smooth it out. Roll it into a 4-inch circle, with the center slightly thicker than the outer edges.
While assembling the buns, be sure to keep your hands clean. Any grease from the filling on your fingers will make it very difficult to seal them.
Add 1 portion of filling to the bun, and crimp it closed, making sure it’s tightly sealed. Lay them seam side down on baking sheets lined with parchment paper, about 3 inches apart.
Cover with a clean towel and allow to rise at room temperature for another hour.
Arrange two racks in the top and bottom thirds of the oven, and preheat to 400°F/200°C. Brush the buns with egg wash, and sprinkle them with sesame seeds, if using.
Transfer the buns to the oven, and immediately turn down the temperature to 350°F/175°C. Bake for 22-25 minutes, or until golden brown.

Take out 6 eggs and 1 cup / 230g butter a few hours before you begin to bring them to room temperature. Prepare all other ingredients before starting.
In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, mix together 1 cup flour (130g), 1 tablespoon active dry yeast (9g), ¼ cup granulated sugar (50g), and 1½ teaspoons salt (8g), before adding ½ cup (120 ml) warm water (at about 120 degrees F/49 degrees C). Turn the mixer on at medium speed for a couple of minutes until well-combined.
Now add in 1 egg at a time. Only add the next egg when the previous egg is well incorporated.
Set the mixer to low. Add in 2 cups of flour (260g), a ¼ cup at a time, and let the mixer go until the dough is well combined.
Turn the mixer off, and cut the 2 sticks of softened butter into small cubes/chunks. With the mixer on medium, add the butter in 6 separate batches, waiting until the butter is well incorporated after each batch before adding more.
Set mixer to low. Now add in 1 3/4 cups of flour (230 grams), a ¼ cup at a time until the dough is well-combined. This dough will be very sticky (closer to a very thick batter) when it’s done.
Use a rubber spatula to clean the dough off the mixing paddle, and scrape the sides of the mixing bowl. Cover the dough with a plate or plastic wrap and let it proof at room temperature (about 70 degrees F/21 degrees C) for 3 hours, until it doubles in size.
After 3 hours have elapsed, punch and deflate the dough completely with a rubber spatula. Cover the dough with a plate again, and refrigerate it overnight until 3 hours before you’re ready to bake the next day.

Remove the dough from the refrigerator. Divide it into two equal pieces. Shape them on a lightly floured clean surface, and place each into its own loaf pan (loaf pan size: 9"" x 5""). The chilled dough is a bit stiffer to work with, so you can use a rolling pin to help shape it into the desired width and length. If you do this, make sure to roll the dough lengthwise like a cigar when you’re done to ensure a rounded top to your loaf. Whatever you do, the dough should fit snugly in the loaf pan.
Now, you can create plain loaves as I’ve described above, or you could create a braid or individual buns, as pictured. Totally up to you, the baker!
Cover each loaf pan tightly with clear plastic wrap, and let proof at room temperature for about 2½ to 3 hours, until doubled in size.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F / 180 degrees C while the dough is proofing. Bake for 37 to 40 minutes in the center of the oven. Tent the loaves with foil if the crust is getting too dark. While it’s baking, prepare the sugar water by mixing 2 teaspoons sugar with 1 tablespoon water until the sugar is completely dissolved. When the bread is done, remove from the oven, and immediately brush the tops of the bread with sugar water to give it that shiny finish.
Let the bread sit in the loaf pan for 5 minutes to cool before transferring the loaves from the pans to a cooling rack. This cooling step is important so the bread does not fall apart.
Once the bread has cooled completely, you can store it in a tight sealed container or zip-lock bag to keep it fresh. This bread is also heavenly when served slightly warm with softened butter.",en-US,4.83,,The Woks of Life,2920,20 serving(s),1 serving,220 kcal,26 g,5 g,11 g,6 g,74 mg,195 mg,3 g,1 g,,

Wait 15 minutes until the yeast mixture “blooms” and foams. Stir in 1 tablespoon of canola oil, and set aside.
While you wait for the yeast mixture to “bloom,” whisk together 2 cups all-purpose flour, 2 tablespoons cornstarch, ¼ teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon baking soda in a medium bowl. Stir in the yeast mixture using a rubber spatula. After the dry and wet ingredients are well incorporated, knead the dough until smooth and soft. If the dough feels sticky, add a bit more flour 1 tablespoon at a time, and continue kneading until the dough is smooth, soft, and pliable, but not sticky. Brush the top of the dough with 1 teaspoon canola oil, cover the bowl with a plate, and let it proof at room temperature until it has doubled in size (about 1 hour).
While the dough is proofing, prepare your steaming device/setup of choice. (Check our Chinese cooking tools page for steamer setup options using a steamer rack in a wok or a multi-level metal steamer—both of which we use regularly in our kitchen. Leave at least 2 inches of space between the water and the steam rack so the water doesn’t touch the buns during the steaming process.
After the dough finishes proofing, punch it down and knead it for a few minutes to get rid of all the air bubbles. This step is important for achieving smooth and uniform buns! Portion the dough into 12 equal balls. Roll each ball into a 4x7 inch oval shape, lightly brushing the tops with oil to prevent sticking. Fold the dough in half with a small piece of parchment paper in the middle. Line the bun with another piece of parchment paper on the bottom and place it in your steamer to proof a second time. Repeat these steps until you’ve used up all the dough, cover the lid of the steamer, and let proof for another 20 minutes.
After 20 minutes, turn the heat on your steamer setup to high. Once you see steam coming out, reduce the heat to medium, and let the buns steam for another 10 minutes. Turn off the heat and let the buns rest inside the steamer for 5 minutes. Do NOT Remove the cover/lid. This is VERY important, because if you remove the cover too early, the buns will collapse and lose their fluffy shape!!!
After 5 minutes have elapsed, the buns are ready to remove from the steamer.
You can use them immediately, or these buns also freeze well for later use. Just let them cool completely before freezing, because any condensation inside whatever you use to store the buns will make them soggy. Then, when you’re ready to eat them, just steam them for 5 minutes to reheat.",en-US,5.0,,The Woks of Life,165,12 serving(s),1 serving,98 kcal,19 g,3 g,1 g,1 g,,62 mg,1 g,1 g,,

Let stand for 15 minutes until foamy.
While the yeast is working, whisk together the melted butter, light brown sugar, egg, milk, and salt. Make sure everything is dissolved and thoroughly combined. With the dough hook attachment, turn the mixer on low, and add the whole wheat flour to the milk mixture one cup at a time.
Now add the foamy yeast liquid to the dough, keeping the mixer on low speed until you get a well combined wet dough mixture (see the photo). This process will take a few minutes. Now it’s time to add the all-purpose flour, ½ cup at a time, with the mixer still at low speed. Added on 4/12/2018: Change to adding 1 tablespoon at a time with the last 1/2 cup of all-purpose flour until the dough ""lifts"" away from the sides of the mixing bowl, because you might not need all 3 cups of all-purpose flour in the drier months.
If the dough is still wet, add one tablespoon of flour at a time, until the dough “lifts” from the sides of the mixing bowl. Try not to add too much flour, though. The dough should be soft without sticking to your hands or the mixing bowl. Once the dough ball is formed, knead the dough for another 5 to 7 minutes. The additional kneading helps generate more gluten, and gluten is what gives the bread its signature texture!
Cover the dough with a clean kitchen towel, and let it proof at room temperature for 1 hour, or until it doubles in size.
While the dough is proofing, grease two loaf pans with butter, and set them aside. I usually just rub a cold stick of butter along the sides and bottoms of the pans.
Once the dough is done with the first hour of proofing, punch it down, and put it back in the mixer. Mix the dough on low speed for 3 to 5 minutes to get rid of any air bubbles. Divide the dough in half. Shape each half into a loaf, and place into each of your greased loaf pans.
Cover the loaves once again with your clean kitchen towel, and let them proof for another 30 minutes at room temperature, until almost doubled in size. (The dough will continue to rise during baking as well.)
While the dough is proofing, place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 375°F. Before putting the loaves in the oven, quickly brush the tops with oil. Bake for 30-35 minutes. If the color of the bread gets too dark, tent the loaves with aluminum foil.
After baking, carefully take the loaves out of the baking pan, and let them cool on a rack. If not, hot steam will moisten the crust, which you don’t want!

Keeping the speed at “stir,” slowly add the water in a few separate batches (you may need more or less depending on the humidity in your kitchen).
Knead the dough for 15 minutes. The dough should be sticky, but not stick to the sides of the bowl. Cover the dough, and let rest for 30 minutes. This can be done by hand if you don’t have a mixer. Just knead the dough for 5-10 minutes longer.
On a clean, lightly floured surface, form the dough into a long flat loaf shape, about 1/4-inch thick and 4 inches wide. Take the time to make it truly uniform. Place it in the center of a large piece of plastic wrap on a baking sheet or long, flat plate. Wrap the dough, tucking the two ends of the plastic under the loaf, and ensuring that the dough is completely covered. Refrigerate overnight.
In the morning, take out the dough and let it sit on the counter (wrapped) for 1-3 hours until the dough is completely back to room temperature and VERY, VERY soft to the touch. This step is critical, and may take longer in the colder months. If you don't let the dough come back to room temperature, it won't fry up properly.
Now prepare the oil for frying using your wok. You can also use a large pan with some depth for added safety. The goal is to have a large vessel, so that you can produce authentically long crullers. Use medium heat to slowly bring the oil up to 400-425°F/205-220°C.
While the oil is heating up, you can unwrap the dough. Gently flip the dough onto a lightly floured surface, peeling off the plastic wrap. Very lightly flour the top side of the dough also. Next, cut the dough into 1-inch wide strips (try to cut an even number of strips). Then stack them two by two, and press the center, lengthwise, with a chopstick. Hold the two ends of each piece, and gently stretch the dough to a 9-inch long rope.
Once the oil is up to temperature, carefully lower the stretched dough into the oil. If the oil temperature is right, the dough should surface right away. Now take a long cooking tool (we used chopsticks, but you could also use tongs), and quickly roll the dough in a continuous motion for about a minute.
You can fry one to two at a time. Just be sure to take the time to continuously roll the dough in the oil. The youtiao is done once they turn light golden brown. Try not to over-fry them as they become unpleasantly crunchy rather than chewy and delicious.
Now, repeat those steps with the remaining dough.

Now mix in the whole wheat flour, a quarter cup at a time, until the dough is smooth, soft, pliable, and not sticky. Cover the dough, and let it rest for 20 minutes.
Now, prepare your steamer with cold water. Make sure the water doesn’t touch the mantou during steaming. Brush the steam rack with a bit of vegetable oil, or prepare 12 small (3” x 3”) squares of parchment paper to prevent the mantou from sticking to the steam rack.

Start by washing and rinsing the red beans prior to soaking. Soak the red beans overnight. When you're ready to start cooking the paste, pour the red beans and water into a medium-sized pot. Ensure that the water level is about ¼"" above the red beans. Bring to a boil, then turn down the heat to simmer. Cook the beans until completely softened. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.
Since we are making a paste, you don't want a lot of liquid in the beans. Most of the water should be cooked off and the beans should be very thick before you move forward. Be careful, because as more water cooks off, burning the beans is very easy to do. This whole process will take a few hours.
When the beans have a thick consistency, transfer to a food processor. Depending on the size of yours, you may need to process the bean mixture in batches. Process until the mixture is totally smooth. If you like your red bean paste chunky, skip this step or process to desired consistency. Transfer the paste back to the pot.
Heat the paste over medium-low heat. Add the sugar and stir to dissolve. Then add the butter. More butter means a richer paste. You can also use vegetable oil at this step, but butter adds a more pleasant flavor. Cook for an additional 15-20 minutes to cook off even more moisture from the paste.
Quick disclaimer here: It won't look like the packaged red bean paste you get at the store because those pastes have enormous amounts of sugar and oil added to make them sticky and dark. We're going for a more natural Chinese bakery red bean paste here. If you like the store-bought red bean paste, feel free to take a shortcut and use that!
Set aside and let cool for an hour or so before using. Do not refrigerate!
To make the milk bread dough:
To save time, make the milk bread dough while the red bean paste is cooking. In the bowl of a mixer, add the heavy cream, milk, egg, sugar, cake flour, bread flour, yeast, and salt. Use the dough hook attachment, and turn on the mixer to “stir.” Let it go for 15 minutes, occasionally stopping the mixer to push the dough together. If you're in a humid climate and the dough is too sticky, feel free to add a little more flour 1/4 cup at a time until it comes together. The dough should be moist, but not so sticky that it sticks excessively to the bowl or dough hook. If you don't have a mixer and would like to knead by hand, extend the kneading time by 5-10 minutes.
After 15 minutes of mixing, the dough is ready for proofing. Cover the bowl with a damp towel and place in a warm spot for 1 hour. The dough will grow to 1.5X its original size.
Assemble the red bean bread:
Grease one standard loaf pan on all sides with butter. Also, line a cookie sheet with parchment paper.
After the hour of proofing, put the dough back in the mixer and stir for another 5 minutes to get rid of air bubbles. Dump the dough on a lightly floured surface, and cut it in half. Set aside one half for a red bean swirl loaf, and cut the other half into 8 pieces for individual red bean buns.
We'll start with the buns. Here's where the fun part comes in. For each bun, use about 2 tablespoons of red bean paste. For a standard red bean bun, just roll one piece of dough into a ball, flatten with your hand or roll out to half inch thickness and place the red bean filling in the center. Pinch the dough closed around the red bean and place on your cookie sheet, seam-side down.
To make some slightly more interesting shapes, just follow along with the pictures! You can roll them like cinnamon buns, and then make strategic cuts with scissors to add a decorative flair. Check out this post to see how to make the pretty swirl shape shown here.
Okay, now for the red bean swirl loaf. Take the first half of dough and shape into a rectangle. Roll out to a little less than ¾-inch thickness with a floured rolling pin, maintaining a rectangle shape. Now, take a few big dollops of red bean paste and spread over the center of the rectangle, leaving a few inches on either side of the rectangle and one inch along the top and bottom. The paste should be spread to about 1/8-inch thickness.
Fold over each side of the rectangle so a seam runs down the center of the dough. Pinch all the open edges closed.
Next, roll out the dough to flatten the seams and make the rectangle of dough roughly as large as it was when you started. Then, fold the dough into thirds (like you would if you were folding a piece of paper to put into an envelope). Roll it out into a rectangle once more. Add more flour to the dough/board if necessary.
Repeat the step of folding the dough into thirds, but this time, roll it out just so that the layers press together and the piece of dough is the length of the loaf pan. Make two lengthwise cuts in the dough so you have three segments. Braid the pieces with the layered sides facing up. This will make for a really nice pattern when it bakes up. Pinch the ends of the braided dough together and gently place into your buttered loaf pan.
Let the buns and the loaf proof for another hour. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Brush the risen dough with egg wash. Bake the buns for 18-20 minutes and the loaf for 35-45 minutes. Remove from the oven and brush the bread with sugar water to give them a really great shine, sweetness, and color.
These don't keep for too long, so if you don't gobble them up right away, best to store them in the refrigerator and then heat them up in the microwave for 20 seconds. The red bean swirl loaf is excellent sliced, toasted, and served with a little butter.
If you have red bean paste left over, it keeps really well in a tupperware in the fridge. If you want to make another batch of these buns, when the time comes, just warm up the paste ever so slightly in a small pot—just enough to make it easily spreadable.",en-US,4.63,,The Woks of Life,405,16 serving(s),1 serving,298 kcal,46 g,8 g,9 g,5 g,37 mg,271 mg,14 g,3 g,,

I've achieved excellent results with all combos))"", '1 level tablespoon fine sea salt', 'Your favorite jarred or homemade tomato sauce ((warmed))', '1 small onion ((sliced thinly))', ""1 block of mozzarella cheese ((grated, we prefer regular ol' mozz over fresh for these pizzas but feel free to go with fresh!))"", '1 cup grape tomatoes ((halved))', '1 small potato ((sliced into extremely thin rounds and tossed with olive oil, salt and pepper))', '1/3 of a Japanese eggplant', '3 cups spinach leaves (roughly chopped)', 'Large handful of fresh basil ((torn))', 'Salt', 'Freshly ground black pepper', 'Extra virgin olive oil', '2/3 cup ricotta cheese', '1/4 cup sun-dried tomatoes ((roughly chopped))']","To make the dough:
In a large bowl, dissolve the sugar in the warm water. Mix in the yeast with a fork, breaking up big clumps, and follow with the olive oil. Give it a quick stir and allow to sit for 15-20 minutes, until it's uber- foamy and puffed up in the bowl!
When it's good and foamy, start adding your flour one cup at a time, stirring with a wooden spoon or spatula. After the first cup, sprinkle the salt over the mixture evenly. Keep adding flour. After adding the fifth cup, assess your consistency--if it's still quite wet, inch towards 6 cups. If it's dry enough to start kneading, dive in with floured hands. I always leave some flour allowance between what I add during the mixing phase and the total stated because you're going to add flour as you knead.
Knead the dough for 5-10 minutes, adding flour to make the dough smooth and elastic. It will stick to your hands in the beginning; just scrape it off and add more flour as you go. It's helpful to measure out your remaining amount of flour (so 7 cups minus what you've already added before kneading) so you don't surpass the maximum amount required as you marvel over your lovely dough.
When the dough is smooth and elastic, and there are no more excess dough bits at the bottom of your bowl, sprinkle some fresh flour in the bottom of the bowl and on top of your dough, cover with a warm damp cloth, and let rise in a warm room or a closed oven for 1 hour, or until doubled in size.
At this point, you can punch the dough down, or cover the bowl with plastic wrap and put it in the fridge until you’re ready to use it. I like to use it right away because a dough that sits in the fridge too long starts to develop an unpleasant yeasty flavor, though others would probably contradict me.
When you’re ready to roll out the crust, preheat your oven to 500 degrees. If you're using a stone, make sure that's in the oven. Liberally flour your board prior to rolling out your dough. I can't emphasize this enough, because if you'll be sliding your pizza onto a stone in the oven, it will need to be jiggly enough on your cutting board when weighed down with toppings to slide oh-so-effortlessly onto the stone. Seriously. You've been warned. You should be using a wooden board, will which act as your MacGyver-ed pizza peel, if you're going the pizza stone route. If you're using a sheet pan, just roll the dough out on the pan.
Okay, now comes the tricky part. Rolling out the dough. Seems simple--just grab your rolling pin and squidge the hell out of it until it's a neat circle, right? WRONG.
When you start with your gob of dough, you want to roughly shape it with floured hands into a flattish circle. At this point it will be thick--about an inch. Then you want to go in with the fists. We're talkin' pizzeria level technique here--but it's seriously not hard! Just place the dough on your two fists and imagine that your making tiny little vertical fist pumps with your hands rotating slightly. As you do this, the dough will naturally stretch by its own weight. Better yet, the dough will stretch from the center (i.e. where your fists contact the dough), which means that you'll end up with a slightly thicker edge. That's your crust! Now your job is to make sure the dough stretches evenly and that no holes are allowed to punch through your lovely dough. You'll want to do this until the dough is about a quarter inch thick. Unevenness within a range of 1/8""-1/4"" is totally fine. In fact, it's your friend. Lay the dough down on your liberally floured board.
If you're one of those people that is adamant about your pizza being, in fact, a circle, now is when you grab the rolling pin. Use the pin to roll out from the center, never allowing the pin to squish your crust. Rolling the dough out shouldn't be in a traditional Paula-Deen-pie-crust way, but with the pin angled to follow the radius of the dough until you've achieved a circle with a raised crust. So you're not rolling out from the center, you're rolling around to follow the circle of the dough. Again, never letting the pin crush the crust. This means the pin should be angled ever so slightly at about 15-20 degrees to preserve crust height. If you see air bubbles--excellent, use the pin or your hands to gently push them to the edges (THESE WILL BE CRUST BUBBLES!).
Now. You're ready for toppings.
To make the Veggie Supreme Pizza:
Grab your sauce. Spread it evenly on your pie. Sprinkle over the sliced onions, followed by half of the mozzarella cheese you want on the pizza. Sprinkle over some grape tomatoes, followed by the potato and eggplant rounds, spinach, and basil. Sprinkle with more mozzarella, season with salt and pepper, and drizzle with olive oil. Bake for 10-14 minutes at 500-550 degrees F.
To make the Spinach and Sun-Dried Tomato White Pizza:
Spread a thin layer of olive oil over your crust. Spread on a layer of ricotta cheese, and sprinkle with onion and cherry tomatoes. Sprinkle on half the mozzarella you want on the pie, followed by the spinach, basil, and chopped sun-dried tomato. Sprinkle with more cheese, season with salt and pepper, and drizzle with olive oil.

Let the mixture sit until the yeast “blooms” and foams (about 15 minutes). Stir in 1 tablespoon oil and set aside.
Whisk together the flour, cornstarch, salt, and baking soda in a medium-sized bowl, and stir in the yeast mixture using a spatula. After the dry and wet ingredients are incorporated, knead the dough with your hands (or in your mixer) until the dough becomes smooth and soft. If the dough looks sticky, add a bit more flour 1 tablespoon at a time, and continue kneading until the dough is smooth and soft. The dough should be soft, but not sticky.
Coat the dough with 1 teaspoon of oil and cover with plastic wrap. Let the dough proof at room temperature until it has doubled in size (about 1 hour).
While the dough is proofing, prepare your steaming device/setup of choice. (Check our Chinese cooking tools page for steamer setup options using a steamer rack in a wok or a multi-level metal steamer, both of which we use regularly in our kitchen.) Place the lop cheung (Chinese sausages) on a heatproof plate and steam for 10 minutes. Let cool.
For this recipe, we called for a whole lop cheung in each bun, but if you feel this is too much, just split them lengthwise after they’ve steamed and cooled and use half a chinese sausage for each bun!
After the dough is finished proofing, punch the dough down and knead it for a few minutes to get rid of all the air bubbles. Portion the dough into 10 equal balls and shape each ball into a long strip, measuring 10 inches long. Wrap each length of dough around one lop cheung so the dough overlaps. Tuck in the loose ends. This is the same method used in our recipe for Chinese Hot Dog Buns.
Place each bun on one of your prepared rectangles of parchment paper, and place the buns into your steamer. Cover with a damp kitchen towel to keep the dough from drying out, and let rest for 20 minutes.
Place the buns in the steamer with 1½ inches of cold water, and turn the heat on high. Once you can see steam coming out, turn the heat down to medium, and let the buns steam for another 10 minutes until they have expanded in size.
Remove the steamer from the stove. Let the buns rest inside the steamer for 5 minutes--do not remove the cover. This is an important step, because if you remove the cover too early, the buns will collapse and lose their fluffy shape!
After those five minutes have elapsed, transfer the buns to a plate and serve warm!
These Chinese sausage buns freeze and reheat really nicely. Make sure you steam the buns and let them cool completely before freezing.

In a small pot over medium low heat, dry roast the whole peppercorns of your choice for 15 minutes, until very fragrant. Take care not to burn them, adjusting the heat as needed. Cool completely and use a spice grinder or mortar and pestle to grind the peppercorns down to a powder.
In the same pot over medium heat, dry roast the salt until it turns slightly yellow in color. Let it cool and combine it with the ground pepper. You now have your own authentic salt and pepper powder, which you can use in whatever “salt and pepper” dish you like. The rest of the recipe is really easy.
To prepare the dish:
Rinse the shrimp and pat them thoroughly dry with a paper towel. Dredge them in potato starch or cornstarch––whatever you’re using.

In the wok, heat 2 tablespoons of oil over medium heat. Fry the garlic until just golden brown (careful not to burn it!), and set aside to drain on a paper towel lined plate.
Remove any excess oil from the wok, so there's only a tablespoon or so left (you don’t want to use too much oil at this stage, as this is a “dry” dish). Add the peppers to the wok.

We like this method because it evenly distributes the filling throughout the bun.
Transfer the buns to a parchment-lined baking sheet and cover with a clean kitchen towel. Allow to rise for another 45 minutes to an hour.
Preheat your oven to 350 degrees. For the topping, mix together 1/3 cup cake flour, 3 tablespoons softened butter, and 4 ½ teaspoons caster sugar, and transfer to a piping bag or small zip top bag with a small corner cut off. Set aside.

Mash the pumpkin with a fork until smooth.
In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment, add ingredients in the following order: pumpkin puree, heavy cream, milk, egg, sugar, cake flour, bread flour, yeast, and salt. When measuring the flour, tap the measuring cup against a hard surface to ensure there are no air pockets.
Turn the mixer on to the lowest setting, and let it go for 15 minutes--stopping occasionally to push the dough down off the hook. If you're in a humid climate and the dough is too sticky, feel free to add a little more flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the dough comes together and pulls away from the sides of the bowl. If you don't have a mixer and would like to knead the dough by hand, extend the kneading time by 10 minutes.
After 15 minutes of mixing, the dough is ready for proofing. Cover the bowl with a damp towel, and place in a warm spot for 1 hour. I proofed the dough in my oven (I had the oven on rapid proof for 5 minutes, turned the oven off, and then closed the oven door). The dough will grow to 1.5x its original size.
In the meantime, grease a square 11x11” pan or 9x13” pan on all sides with a stick of cold butter.
After an hour of proofing, put the dough back in the mixer and stir for another 5 minutes to get rid of any air bubbles.
Next, divide the dough into 16 equal pieces on a lightly floured surface, with the help of your kitchen scale. Shape each piece of dough into a smooth ball and arrange them on the pan with about half an inch of space between them on all sides. Once shaped, cover and proof for another hour until the buns grow to 1.5X their original size.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Brush the risen dough with egg wash, and sprinkle with the raw pumpkin seeds.
Place in the middle of the oven and bake for 16-18 minutes until the tops are golden brown.

Then make the filling components. In a small bowl, combine the pork, five spice, cumin, soy sauce, pinch of sugar, and 1/4 teaspoon salt. In another bowl, combine the cabbage, scallion, garlic powder, sesame oil, and white pepper.
Now you're ready to assemble the pancakes. Divide the dough into 8 equal portions and keep the unused dough covered with a damp towel. Next, use a couple drops of oil to lightly oil your work surface--a bamboo or wood cutting board works well. Roll one of the dough pieces into a long, thin rectangle about four inches wide.

Wash and peel your turnip/radish. Grate 1 cup.
Make the batter by putting the flour, cornstarch, salt, white pepper, egg, water, sesame oil, and 1 tablespoon of sesame seeds into a mixing bowl and combining thoroughly. Fold in the sausage, shrimp, and grated turnip.

Pour in the boiling water, and carefully stir the flour and water with a rubber spatula until it forms a thick paste. Stir in the butter until well combined. Let the mixture cool for about 20 minutes.
Once the multigrain mixture is warm to the touch and not hot, stir in the honey until thoroughly combined. Stir in the yeast (and vital wheat gluten if using, in that order). It’s important to make sure the mixture truly is lukewarm before adding the yeast. Let stand for 10 minutes to activate the yeast.
Add the all purpose flour, ¼ cup at a time, and knead until the dough ball is smooth. This will take about 10-15 minutes. The dough should be slightly sticky, but should not stick to a rubber spatula. Soft dough makes soft bread, so do not use more flour than necessary!
Use the rubber spatula to clean the sides of the bowl, and form the dough into a smooth ball. Cover the bowl with a plate, and let it rise in a warm place for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until the dough doubles in size.
Once the first proofing is done, sprinkle 1 teaspoon salt over the dough and knead again for another 5 minutes to make sure the salt is evenly distributed.
Shape the dough into a smooth dough ball, cover with a plate, and let it rise again in a warm place for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until the dough doubles in size. If you are proofing the dough in the microwave like I do, you’ll need another large mug of boiling water for the second proofing.
While the dough is proofing, grease 2 loaf pans (9” x 5”) with cold butter and set them aside. I use cold butter, as it’s easier to handle and goes on in a thin layer. I simply take a cold stick of butter, peel back the wrapper, and rub it along the inside of the loaf pans to coat.

Once the dough is done proofing, add the sea salt, white pepper, and Sichuan peppercorns (or five spice powder). Knead for another 5 minutes, until everything is well-combined. If the stickiness of the dough makes it difficult to work with, oil your hands rather than using additional flour.
Cover the dough with the towel again, and let it rest on the counter for another 15 minutes. At this point, you can very finely chop the scallions (they must be small to distribute evenly throughout the pancake and release more flavor).
Knead the dough one more time for 2 minutes to get rid of any air bubbles. Brush a clean, flat work surface (such as a clean counter or cutting board) lightly with oil. Using an oiled rolling pin, roll the dough into a thin rectangle a little less than ¼-inch (0.6 cm) thick.
Brush the rolled dough with a thin layer of oil, and evenly cover it with the scallions. Roll it up lengthwise into a tight log.
Roll the log into a thinner tube (this also helps reduce air pockets), and roll the tube into a spiral to form a thick disc. Tuck the end underneath.
Use your hands and a rolling pin to press the disc down into a 10” circle. Sprinkle both sides liberally with sesame seeds, making sure the entire surface is covered. Press the sesame seeds into the dough with the palm of your hand. (The dough circle will be very soft, so use a bench scraper or large spatula to help you flip it over before sprinkling the other side with sesame seeds too).
In a large flat bottomed non-stick or cast iron pan with a lid (I used a 12” cast iron pan), add 3 tablespoons of oil and spread it evenly across the pan’s surface. Place the dough circle into the oiled pan. (Lay it over your rolling pin to transfer it to the pan.) Cover and allow it to rest for another 20 minutes, without turning on the heat!
After the dough has rested, turn the heat on to medium, with the lid still on. Set a timer for 12 minutes. After 12 minutes, open the lid and check the bottom. When it’s evenly golden brown, flip the pancake, cover again, and cook for another 6 minutes.
Remove the lid, and cook for another few minutes to dry out the crust. The pancake is done when both sides are a deep golden brown, and the outer crust is crisp (it should sound hollow when you tap on it).

In a skillet over medium high heat, add 2 tablespoons oil and brown the ground meat. Add the onion and garlic, and cook until translucent. Add the tomato sauce, raisins, pecans, smoked paprika, chili powder, cinnamon, and salt.
Let cool as you prepare the other items. Once cooled, mix in the shredded cheese.
Prepare the peppers and salsa:
Broil the peppers and onion on a sheet pan, with the broiler on high, until they are blackened on one side. Flip and broil until entirely charred. Watch them closely! Set them aside, covered with a clean kitchen towel, to loosen the skins.
Blend the charred onion, tomatoes, serrano chilies, garlic, and cilantro. Process the salsa to your preferred consistency—it can be very smooth or a little chunky.
Heat a skillet with 1 tablespoon oil over high heat. Add the salsa to the pan and simmer. Season to taste with salt and pepper and cook until it has reduced a bit and the salsa’s color has changed from light pink to red-orange.
Now use a paper towel or clean kitchen cloth to gently remove the skins from the poblano peppers. Slice an opening lengthwise on each pepper, leaving the rest of the pepper intact. Remove the excess inner membranes and seeds (it doesn’t have to be perfect).
Gently stuff each pepper with filling, sealing the seam with toothpicks.
Fry and serve:
Heat your frying oil to 375 degrees F/190 degrees C
Beat the egg whites with an electric mixer on high speed until soft peaks form. With the mixer running on medium, add the egg yolks one at a time, and beat for 3 more minutes.
When the batter is smooth, light, and fluffy, and coats the back of a wooden spoon without dripping, it is ready to use.
Dredge the peppers in flour, then dip in the batter. Carefully place the pepper in the hot oil. When the bottom of the chile is golden brown, carefully turn it over with a spatula, without damaging the batter. Fry until golden brown.
You can fry 1-2 peppers at a time depending on the size of your skillet, but it’s best not to crowd the pan, so you can easily flip them without damaging the batter. We fried one pepper at a time.

Prepare a pot of boiling water and an ice bath. Once the pot of water is boiling, blanch the bok choy for a quick 10 seconds in two separate batches. With each batch, the water should be at a rolling boil before you add the bok choy. With a large slotted spoon, scoop out the blanched bok choy and immediately transfer to the ice bath to stop the cooking process.
Strain the bok choy once it’s cooled completely in the ice bath. Do your best to squeeze out as much water as you can. This step is very important for preventing soggy buns!
Next, finely chop the bok choy; a food processor is a great time-saver. Transfer to a mixing bowl. Chop the mushrooms finely. Cook them in a wok over medium heat with 2 tablespoons of oil for about 3 to 4 minutes, until they become fragrant. Cool completely.
Next, finely chop the dried bean curd and set aside.
To finish the filling, first pour off any visible liquid in the bowl of chopped bok choy before adding in the cooked mushrooms and dried bean curd. Next, add 1 tablespoon of oil, the light soy sauce, sugar, sesame oil, and white pepper. Mix well. Salt to taste, and put the filling in the refrigerator to marinate. Chilling also helps to keep the bok choy green.
Making the dough
In a bowl, whisk together the water, yeast, and sugar until the yeast dissolves. Let the mixture sit until the yeast “blooms” and foams (about 15 minutes). Stir in 1 tablespoon of oil, and set aside.
In the meantime, whisk together the flour, cornstarch, salt, and baking soda in a medium bowl. Stir in the yeast mixture using a spatula. After the dry and wet ingredients are incorporated, knead the dough with your hands (or using a mixer) until the dough becomes smooth and soft. If the dough looks sticky, add a bit more flour 1 tablespoon at a time. If the dough feels dry, add a few drops of water at a time, and continue kneading until the dough is smooth and soft. The dough should be soft, but not sticky.
Brush the dough with 1 teaspoon of oil and cover with plastic wrap. Let the dough rest until it doubles in size (about 1 hour). Once the dough has risen, punch it down, and knead it for a few minutes to get rid of all air bubbles. Portion the dough into 14 equal dough balls. Cover with a clean kitchen towel to prevent them from drying out.
Assembling and cooking the buns
Cut 14 pieces of parchment paper into 3”x3” squares, and set aside. On a clean and lightly floured flat surface, take a dough ball, roll it out from edge to center, rotate, and repeat until it forms a 4-inch circle. The center should be slightly thicker than the edges. Your buns need solid footing, after all.
Add about 2½ tablespoons of filling to the center, then pleat and twist the bun repeatedly until the top is closed. Sit the bun on a piece of the prepared parchment paper and place it on the rack of your steaming vessel of choice, with at least 1 cm of clearance on all sides. Repeat until all the buns are assembled.
Check our Chinese cooking tools page for steamer setup options. You could use a steamer rack in a wok, a multi-level metal steamer or a bamboo steamer. Just make sure the steaming rack is at least 1½ inches above the water so the boiling water doesn’t touch the buns during the cooking process. Carefully put the buns inside the steamer, cover the lid, and let the buns rest for about 20 minutes (do not turn on the stove yet!).
When the buns are ready to be cooked, turn the heat on high to start the steaming process. Once the water starts to boil and steam is visible, turn the heat down to medium, and steam the buns for another 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, shut off the heat, and let the buns rest inside the steamer for 5 minutes. DO NOT REMOVE THE COVER. This is an important step, because if you remove the cover too early, the buns will collapse and lose their fluffiness! And if you are steaming buns in multiple batches, be sure to start each batch with cold water!
These buns can be enjoyed immediately. You can also store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator or freezer.

Heat 1/3 cup oil in a medium-sized frying pan (we like to use a cast iron skillet) until the oil is about 350F, or when a bamboo chopstick bubbles when inserted into the oil. If you want to make the tofu frying easier, use more oil to achieve a deep fry.

Immediately add the soy sauces, rice vinegar, salt, sugar, and sesame oil. Let the mixture come up to a boil. Immediately add the cornstarch mixture slowly while stirring.
The sauce should be thick enough to coat a spoon. Feel free to add more or less of the cornstarch mixture depending on how thick you like your sauce, but give it 30 seconds to 1 minute between additions, as it does take some time for the sauce to thicken.

Transfer them to a container that allows air to circulate around them, such as a mesh colander, or a baking rack set on top of a baking sheet. Do not overcrowd the mushrooms.
Place them in a well ventilated area (any area of the house with a ready supply of fresh air), preferably in the sun if possible. Allow them to air dry for 7-10 days, until they do not give when squeezed. Drying time will vary based on humidity levels and the size of the mushrooms.
To expedite the process, you can partially dehydrate them in the oven before air drying. Place in an oven heated to 175 degrees F/80 degrees C for 2 hours, flipping them halfway through. Then transfer to a colander to air-dry for another 3-5 days.

We used lotus paste.
Make sesame ball dough. Place 1/2 cup (60g) glutinous rice flour and sugar in a bowl. Pour ¼ cup (60g) of boiling water into the flour and sugar. Mix with a rubber spatula until smooth. Let sit for 5 minutes. Add ¼ cup + 1 tablespoon (70g) room temperature water and the rest of the glutinous flour (1 cup, 120g). Mix with a spatula until it forms a dough, and all the flour has been incorporated. Cover with an overturned plate or put it in a reusable silicone bag. Set aside to rest for 30 minutes.
Prepare your sesame seeds by pouring them in a fine-meshed strainer and rinsing them until they're completely soaked. Let the excess water drain and place the sesame seeds on a plate. Spread them out evenly with enough space for rolling the sesame balls. You can use a paper towel if the sesame seeds are very wet. They should be moist, but not dripping wet.
Your filling should be half the weight of your dough ball. Use your kitchen scale to measure out 8 pieces of lotus or red bean paste that weigh 24g each. Roll them into balls and set aside.
Weigh the dough ball on a digital kitchen scale – it should weigh about 370 to 380 grams. Whatever your weight is, divide it by 8 to get the weight for each dough ball (in our case, we got 47g). Using the kitchen scale, separate the dough into 8 equal pieces, and roll them into balls. Set them aside on a plate, and cover them so they don’t dry out.
To assemble, flatten the dough ball until it is 3 inches in diameter – the middle should be slightly thicker. Place 1 ball of filling in the center of the dough, wrapping the dough around the ball. Pinch the dough together so it covers all the filling, making the thickness of the dough as even as possible. You can pinch excess dough from the point where the sesame ball is sealed to fill empty spots or reinforce areas that look thin.
After the filling is completely covered, gently press it all together to form a ball, rolling it between the palms of your hands until the seams disappear, and you form a uniform round ball.
Roll the ball in the moistened sesame seeds until the entire ball is thoroughly covered. Roll the ball again in your hands to press the sesame seeds into the dough and place on parchment paper until they are ready to deep-fry.
Heat 4 cups of peanut or canola oil in a medium deep pot to a stable 320°F/160°C. (Use a thermometer for accuracy, as achieving the right oil temperature is extremely important.) The oil should fill the pot about halfway.
Add 4 sesame balls into the oil, and immediately use a slotted spoon to gently move them in a circular motion so they do not stick to the pot. This is a necessary step throughout the entire process to ensure even frying. Don’t leave them unattended. Adding the sesame balls will lower the oil temperature down below 300°F/150°C, but shouldn’t take it below 290°F/143°C. Adjust the heat slightly higher or lower to maintain the oil temperature at 300°F/150°C.
After 10 minutes, your sesame balls will begin to float to the top of the oil. Now, your technique changes to keep them rolling in the oil so all sides get the same frying time. You can also occasionally press all four sesame balls down using a slotted spoon or small spider to keep them submerged in the oil. Do this for 2-3 minutes.
At this stage, increase the heat to bring the oil temperature gradually up to 350°F. Fry them for another 5 minutes, for a total of 17-18 minutes, or until they turn a light golden brown. This last stage of frying at a higher temperature browns them. The sesame balls will expand and grow slightly at this higher oil temperature. The outer crust is now strong enough such that they should not burst, as long as you don’t have any weak or thin spots in the dough.
Transfer the finished sesame balls to a strainer, cooling rack or plate lined with paper towels for the oil to drain. Repeat with the second batch. Cool for 10 minutes and serve.",en-US,4.92,,The Woks of Life,120,8 serving(s),1 serving,283 kcal,49 g,4 g,8 g,1 g,,1 mg,20 g,2 g,,

Prepare the vegetables and set them aside. The dish comes together quickly, so it helps to put them on plates ready to go by the stove. If using dried mushrooms, soak them for at least 30 minutes in hot water. (For other tips, see our Chinese Dried and Preserved Ingredients page.) When preparing the fresh leeks, they should be julienned first and then washed 2 to 3 times, as they are quite sandy.

Scoop the veggies into a colander and rinse the bowl clean of any sand. Repeat the process until you don’t see any dirt on the leaves or at the bottom of your bowl.

We used instant dashi, but if you want to make it yourself, we have detailed instructions in our Miso Soup recipe. At this point, you can also cook the rice you’ll serve with the tempura.
Next, prepare the vegetables, making sure everything is washed and trimmed. Nothing should be too wet ahead of frying, so if needed, pat the vegetables with a kitchen towel or let them sit at room temperature to dry off while you prep everything else.
Score the shrimp with a sharp knife so that they can lay flat (you can do this lightly if you don’t mind them retaining some of their curved shape). Refrigerate the shrimp until you’re ready to fry.
Next, make the batter. Stir together the ice water, cake flour, and egg yolks. No need to get rid of all the lumps—in fact, take care not to overmix it. Pop it in the refrigerator while you heat the frying oil.
In a small deep pot, heat enough oil to fill it about halfway, over medium-high heat. While that’s happening, set up a wire rack over a sheet pan or a platter lined with paper towels. When a drop of the batter sizzles vigorously but doesn’t brown too quickly, you’re ready to go.
To fry, swirl one piece of vegetable or shrimp in the batter (for the shrimp, hold it by the tail), and lower it gently into the batter. Fry everything in batches of 3-4 items for 45-90 seconds, turning each item 3-4 times. When the vegetables are lightly golden and the shrimp are lightly golden, orange, and floating, it’s ready to be transferred to the wire rack.
Adjust the heat as needed between batches as you add cold food to the oil. The oil should be hot enough that it doesn’t take too long to cook the tempura, but not so hot that the food immediately turns golden when it hits the oil.

Scoop out the pork, carrots and scallions into a mixing bowl, leaving behind as much liquid in the wok as you can. Pour the rest of the remaining liquid into a measuring cup, and add more water until there is a total of 1⅔ cups (395ml).
Add the rice flour and cornstarch to the carrot mixture and mix in the 1⅔ cups of liquid until everything is well combined, and there are no visible lumps of flour. Set aside. Spread 2 teaspoons vegetable oil in a 9-inch glass loaf pan, ensuring all sides are evenly coated.
Prepare your steamer or wok with a steaming rack, ensuring there is enough water. 2 to 3 quarts for 60 minutes of steaming should do the trick. Bring the water to a slow boil.

Chop the scallions. Set aside half of the green portion for the sauce. Add the rest of the chopped scallion to the shrimp, along with 1 teaspoon salt, 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil, 1 1/2 tablespoons cornstarch, 2 teaspoons Shaoxing wine, and white pepper to taste.

Pop the stems off the bell peppers and follow the lines of each pepper to cut into 3-5 segments. Remove the seeds. If using long hot green peppers, just cut them in half lengthwise and remove the seeds.
Stuff each pepper segment with the shrimp mixture until the filling is even with the edges of the peppers. You can also trim the ends of the peppers to ensure they are flush and at the same level of the filling. This will make the peppers easier to cook.
Heat a tablespoon of oil in a wok or skillet over medium high heat and place the peppers in the oil, stuffing side down. Cook until they are browned, about 2 minutes.

Scrub the radishes clean and rinse. Do NOT peel them. Trim the top and bottom of each radish, and trim away any blemishes or dark spots. Cut them into ½ inch x 2.5 inch pieces (1.25 cm x 6.25 cm). Transfer to a large stainless steel or glass container.
Toss the daikon pieces with 1 ½ tablespoons salt, and set aside for 2 hours.
After 2 hours, squeeze as much liquid out as you can from the daikon pieces. Spread them in a single layer on a baking sheet, or better yet, a wide colander, to allow for airflow. Place in the sun and cover with cheesecloth. Allow to sun dry for 2-3 days (move it indoors at night and keep it at room temperature).
You’ll know that your daikon has reached an ideal level of dryness when they have reduced in size by half. They should feel soft and dry to the touch, and not release any kind of liquid when squeezed.
At this point, you can store them in a glass container and refrigerate as you would with other condiments. Use them in stir-fries and noodle soups––any dish that can use a bit of salt and crunch. Just wash and chop them before cooking.
Seasoning Preserved Daikon:
If you'd like to season your daikon, boil a large pot of water, cover, and allow to cool completely. Use the boiled, cooled water to wash the dried daikon pieces, rubbing them between your palms as you wash to re-hydrate slightly and remove excess salt. Squeeze out as much water as you can.
In a clean mixing bowl, combine the daikon pieces with 1 teaspoon sugar, 1 ½ teaspoons sesame oil, 2 teaspoons light soy sauce, 1 heaping tablespoon of pickled chili sauce, and a small pinch of dried chili flakes. Mix well, cover, and allow to sit in the refrigerator overnight.

To remove any dirt or sand, soak them in a large bowl of water for 10 minutes. Shake the vegetables to loosen the grit. Lift the vegetables out of the dirty water and rinse. Rinse the bowl, fill with fresh water, and repeat this process two more times. This cleaning step is very important.
In a large pot, add 10 cups (2.4 liters) of water, bring to a boil, and turn the heat down to medium low. Stir in 1 ½ tablespoons (26g) of salt, until dissolved.
Place the mustard greens into the simmering water 1 or 2 at a time, so they’re completely submerged. Blanch for 30 seconds, rotating them to evenly heat them on all sides. Lift the mustard greens out of the water and transfer to a clean sheet pan to cool.
Next, put the sliced ginger into the blanching water and bring the water back to a simmer. Once simmering, turn off the heat, and allow the liquid to cool to room temperature.
Once the vegetables are cool enough to handle, pour off any excess water from your sheet pan and rub salt (2 ¼ teaspoons/13g per pound of mustard greens) all over the greens, getting into the inner stems and rubbing the salt evenly across each stem/leaf until it has dissolved.
Place into a non-reactive bowl—stainless steel, enamel, ceramic, or glass work—and pour the ginger-infused blanching liquid over the vegetables. Place a large plate on top of the vegetables with a heavy pot (or a pot filled with water) on top to press them down and keep them submerged. Allow the greens to sit in the salted water for 24 hours at room temperature, covered with a clean towel or paper.
Disinfect the jar by first washing it thoroughly. Wash your hands, and rinse the jar with boiling water. With clean hands or tongs, lift the mustard greens out of the brine solution and let any excess liquid drain for a few seconds.
Squeeze the vegetables tightly. This removes spaces where air bubbles can form, and also makes them more compact. Place them into the jar along with the ginger slices. Do your best to squeeze the vegetables into the jar and distribute the ginger evenly. Reserve the brine, as you will be adding it to the jar momentarily.
Measure 1 teaspoon (6g) salt and ¾ teaspoon (3g) sugar per pound of greens, and sprinkle on top of the vegetables in the jar. Measure out 2 tablespoons (30 ml) white vinegar per pound of vegetables, and pour it over the salt and sugar in the jar.
Next, use a clean ladle to carefully transfer the brine into the jar until it is almost full. Check for air pockets that may be trapped near the bottom of the jar. Use a chopstick to move the mustard greens around to release any air bubbles. You can also cap the jar and move it around to coax air bubbles up to the top. Once you feel all air bubbles have been eliminated, fill the jar to the top to ensure that all of the greens are completely submerged in liquid.
Take a 10- to 12-inch square piece of plastic wrap and fold it in half twice to make a neat smaller square. Place it over the jar, making sure there are no air bubbles under the plastic wrap. Screw the top on over the plastic wrap to create an airtight fit.
Use a clean kitchen cloth to wipe any liquid from the jar and place a label on it with the date. Place the jar in a cool dark place for about 2 days, or until the mustard greens have turned from a bright green to a dull green.
After the mustard greens turn a dull green (2 days), put them in the back of the refrigerator, and they should be ready to eat in 7 days.",en-US,5.0,,The Woks of Life,14505,12 serving(s),1 serving,40 kcal,7 g,4 g,1 g,1 g,,987 mg,2 g,4 g,,

This step can be done ahead of time!
Time to make the mini sticky rice balls. Mix the sweet rice flour with ¼ cup of water in a bowl using your hands. Then add ½ teaspoon water at a time until the dough turns into a play-doh-like consistency—not too wet but pliable. If the dough falls apart as you roll it in between your palms, it’s too dry, but if the dough gets wetter as you roll it in between your palms, it’s too wet. Next, take a small piece—about 3 grams if you have a scale—and roll it into a small ball. Place it on a piece of parchment or clear plastic wrap. Repeat until you’ve used all the dough. Cover with plastic wrap and put the sweet rice balls in the refrigerator while you prepare the rest of the dessert.
In a pot, bring 4 cups of water to a boil. Add the mini pearl tapioca (don’t add it before the water is at a full boil!). Stir and bring it to boil again. Turn off the heat, cover it with a lid, and set your timer for 18 minutes. After 18 minutes have elapsed, the pearl tapioca should turn completely transparent, which means they’re fully cooked. Strain the pearls, rinse them with cold water to prevent them from sticking, and set aside.
In the same pot, bring another 4 cups of water to a boil, and add the sweet rice balls. Stir and let them cook for a few minutes over high heat. When they float to the top, they’re done. Strain and rinse them with cold water to prevent sticking.

Place a plate over the bowl so the mushrooms are completely submerged. Because the mushrooms are small, they should reconstitute quickly. After 15 minutes, cut off the stems of the mushrooms and return them to the water to soak for another 15 minutes.
Wash your cut Shanghai bok choy in a large bowl of water so the vegetables are fully submerged. Agitating or stirring the vegetables in the water will release any dirt or sand. Repeat this process another 2 times or as necessary, until the water is clean and there is no sand or dirt at the bottom of the bowl.
After your mushrooms are done soaking, transfer to a plate and gently squeeze out the excess water. Set the mushrooms and the soaking water aside.
Bring 6 cups of water, 1 tablespoon vegetable oil, and 1 teaspoon salt to a boil. Blanch the Shanghai bok choy for 40 seconds, stirring occasionally. They should be just wilted and bright green. Scoop out the bok choy into a bowl and pour 2 cups of cool water over them. The water will stop the cooking process, but you don’t want your veggies to be ice cold, so pour the bok choy into a colander right after they’ve been submerged in the cool water. Drain.
Next, arrange the bok choy into a circle around a large serving plate, with a space in the middle for the mushrooms.
Now, heat your wok over medium high heat. Spread 1½ tablespoons vegetable oil around the perimeter. Add the finely minced garlic and mushrooms, and stir fry for 10 seconds. Stir in the Shaoxing wine.
Next, carefully pour the mushroom soaking water into the wok, making sure that you don’t pour any sediment from the bowl into the wok.

Put all of the meat filling ingredients in a mixing bowl. Stir in one direction for about 5-10 minutes until the meat mixture becomes a very sticky paste. Set it aside.
Step 2: Assembly
Peel, wash, and cut the lotus roots into 1/8-inch slices. Rinse the lotus root slices in cold water to wash away excess starch and so they don’t turn black (again, they're similar to potatoes). Drain. It’s best to spin them in a salad spinner to get rid of all the excess water.
Take one slice, and spread on a thin layer of meat filling. Top it with another slice of lotus root to create a sandwich. Gently press the two slices together so the meat filling fills the holes of the lotus root on both sides This step will “lock” the two slices together. Repeat until you've used all of the slices. You should be able to make about 15-18 pieces.
Step 3: Make the batter
Add both flours, salt and the five-spice powder to a mixing bowl. Slowly add the water, stirring constantly. Stir thoroughly until any lumps have dissolved. Then stir in the beer. This batter is pretty light. You can thicken it by adding a bit more flour if you like a heavier batter. Also, stir the batter between dipping each lotus root piece, as sweet rice flour tends to settle quickly.
(Don’t coat the lotus roots until right before frying. If too much liquid gets in between the meat and the lotus roots by coating too early, they will fall apart in your pot of oil.) Speaking of which...
Step 4: Frying
Now it’s time to prepare the oil for frying. I like to use a small, deep pot because it requires less oil and its depth helps contain the oil, avoiding splatters and burns.
Fill the pot about 1.5” deep with oil, and heat it to 275 degrees. Once the oil reaches 275 degrees, coat the lotus in the batter and slowly lower into the oil. Fry a few pieces at a time, frying each side for about 6 – 7 minutes. Take them out and set them aside on a plate lined with a paper towel. Repeat until all the lotus sandwiches are fried.

(One of the first of many tricks I learned when working in the restaurant industry!)
Remove the first outer layer of the lettuce and any discolored leaves and discard. Tear the lettuce with your hands into large 4 to 5-inch pieces.
Place the lettuce in a large bowl of very cold water and give it a good stir. This washes your lettuce and rehydrates it. Next, drain the lettuce in a colander and give it a good shake to remove the excess water from the surface of the lettuce. Iceberg lettuce already contains a lot of water, so removing the excess water is important, or you’ll end up with too much liquid. Feel free to use a salad spinner, which is a good idea if your stove and wok does not generate enough high heat.
Combine the soy sauce, oyster sauce, sesame oil, salt, sugar, white pepper into a small bowl and set aside.
Heat your wok over low heat, and add 2 tablespoons of oil and the fresh ginger slice. Make sure to smash the ginger with the side of a knife to release the juices and flavors before you add it. Infuse the oil for 15 seconds, being careful not to burn the ginger.
Turn the heat up to the highest setting, and stir in the chopped garlic. Then mmediately add the iceberg lettuce. Stir-fry everything together, using a scooping motion to coat the lettuce uniformly with the oil. After about 20 seconds, gather the lettuce in the middle of the wok in a pile, so you can see the liquid pooling around it in the wok.
Let cook uncovered for another 15 seconds, and while this is happening, pour the soy sauce mixture over the lettuce. At this point, the sides of the wok will start to super-heat. This may be tough to achieve on your average stove burner, but do your best!
Now in a single motion, stir the lettuce in a circular motion while spreading the lettuce out across the wok. The idea is to get the lettuce and the liquid searing along the sides of the wok to get that wok hei flavor. After the searing has stopped, repeat the process of gathering the lettuce in the middle of the wok again and letting the sides of the wok heat up again.
After this second round of searing, your iceberg lettuce should be tender, with the green parts wilted. Stir fried lettuce should be slightly crunchy, so be sure not to overcook it.

You don’t want them to get soggy.
Carefully break off the mushroom stems (they should come off easily, or you can cut them). Set them aside and toss them into a vegetable stir-fry, vegetable stock, lo mein, or an omelette! You might think about including them in the stuffing, but that will make it too wet, which you don’t want! A drier stuffing is key to making these stuffed mushroom caps a success.
Pat the mushroom caps dry with a paper towel, and arrange them neatly on a sheet pan with the cap side up.
Heat 6 tablespoons of butter in a small saucepan over low heat until it’s just melted. Remove from the heat. Next, use a brush to lightly brush the mushroom caps with melted butter, turning them over afterwards so they are top-side down.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. While the oven is preheating, make the stuffing. Stir ½ teaspoon onion powder, ½ teaspoon granulated garlic, 1 teaspoon dried thyme, ½ teaspoon paprika, and ¼ teaspoon salt (or to taste) into the butter until well combined. Use a rubber spatula to mix in ¾ cup plain or Italian breadcrumbs until all the breadcrumbs are saturated with butter. Next, add 1/3 cup grated parmesan cheese and 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh parsley, and stir to combine.
Stuff a spoonful of breadcrumb mixture into each mushroom cap but don't pack or compress the stuffing which will keep your stuffed mushrooms light and flaky, then bake them for 9-12 minutes. The mushrooms should be cooked through, but firm enough to pick up with your hands. You don’t want to overcook them, or they’ll be droopy and hard to handle.

Set everything aside.
Then wash and wipe all the vegetables dry using a clean kitchen towel (this is key!) before cutting them into large bite-sized pieces. Don’t let the cut potato and eggplant sit for too long before cooking, because they will oxidize and become discolored.
Now we’re ready to cook. Heat the oil in your wok over medium heat. Add the potato, and brown lightly for about 8 minutes until cooked through. Stir occasionally to avoid burning them. Now add the bell peppers, and stir-fry for another minute. Transfer everything to a dish and set aside.

If you haven’t made our belacan sauce in advance, follow these directions to make a quick version.
Chop the soaked dried shrimp, and add it to a mortar and pestle along with the ¼ cup of water it soaked in. Also add the belacan, sliced shallot, garlic, dried chili, and holland chili. Mix and grind until well-combined. The belacan should dissolve into the other ingredients and be well-incorporated. Set aside for 15 minutes.
Add 1 ½ tablespoons oil to a wok or saucepan over medium heat, and add the sauce mixture. Fry for about 5-8 minutes, or until fragrant, stirring occasionally and adjusting the heat as necessary so it doesn’t burn. Set aside.
Trim and Wash the Water Spinach (Kangkung)
Trim the 1-2 inches from the tough ends of the water spinach and discard. Pick out and discard any leaves that aren’t fresh and vibrant green.
Cut the remaining water spinach into 2 to 3 inch (5-8 cm) lengths. Transfer them to a large basin of cold water. They should be fully submerged to clean them properly. Use your hands to agitate the water and the vegetables to shake out any grit. Soak for 5 to 10 minutes to allow any dirt or sand particles to settle.
Gently lift the water spinach out of the water to a colander. Discard the sandy water, and repeat the process 1-2 times, until the vegetables are clean.
Drain completely, giving the colander a few good shakes to remove excess water. You can also run the clean water spinach through a salad spinner to make sure it’s really dry.
Prepare Other Ingredients in Advance
Prepare and measure out the julienned ginger, chopped garlic, Shaoxing wine, sugar, MSG, and white pepper.
Cook!
Heat your wok over medium high heat until it begins to smoke. Immediately add 3 tablespoons of oil, along with the ginger and garlic. Stir for 5-10 seconds, and add the belacan sauce. Cook for another 10 seconds, and add the water spinach.
Immediately turn your heat up to the highest setting, and use a scooping motion to mix the vegetables, oil, and sauce together. When the vegetables are half wilted, gather them together in a pile in the center of the wok.
Pour the Shaoxing wine around the perimeter of the wok, and cover it. This will allow the sides of the wok to heat up, while the vegetables are protected from burning by the liquid pooled in the center. It’s a classic Cantonese technique, and can help you achieve a wok hei seared flavor even if you don’t have a large burner.
Depending on how hot your stove is, wait 30-60 seconds before removing the cover. Toss in the sugar, MSG, and white pepper.
Spread the vegetables out onto the sides of the wok, and mix in a circular motion to get them seared on the heated wok perimeter.

Place your dried Shiitake mushrooms in a bowl of hot water. Cover and soak for 1 hour or until fully hydrated.
Once hydrated, cut off the stems and sliced them into strips. You can also use fresh shiitake mushrooms, but dried mushrooms are more fragrant!
Prepare your mung bean glass noodles
Soak the mung bean noodles in lukewarm water for 10 minutes until rehydrated. Use Kitchen shears to cut the noodles into 1 to 1½-inch lengths.
Cook the vegetable egg roll filling
Heat your wok over medium-high heat. Add 2 tablespoons peanut oil to the wok, and add the minced garlic and Shiitake mushrooms. Stir-fry for 15 seconds. Next, add the carrot and the red bell peppers. Stir-fry for another 15 seconds.
Turn up the heat to high, and add both of the cabbages. Toss everything together for 1 minute. Next, add the mung bean glass noodles, Shaoxing wine, salt, sugar, sesame oil, white pepper and five spice powder, if using. Stir-fry for another minute, mix in the chopped scallions, and transfer to a large bowl. Cool completely. NOTE: If your wok is smaller, you may have to cook the filling in two batches.
Fold the egg rolls
Place one egg roll wrapper flat with a corner toward you, so it looks like a diamond shape.
Measure a spoonful of filling (55g), placing it near the corner closest to you.
Fold the corner closest to you over the filling, and press the wrapper in so it hugs the filling.
Fold the two opposite corners inwards so it looks like an envelope.
Brush some egg wash on the opposite corner, and don’t miss any spots!
Fold the egg roll forward, ensuring the roll stays tucked tightly. The egg wash should keep the egg roll together.
To Fry the Egg Rolls:
In a small pot, heat your frying oil to 325 degrees F/160 degrees C. You don't need too much––just enough to submerge the egg rolls. Whatever size pot you’re using, make sure you only fill it halfway, so oil does not overflow when you are frying. Hot oil near open flames can be extremely dangerous and flare up!
Carefully place a couple egg rolls at a time into the oil. Fry for about 5 minutes until golden brown. Keep them moving in the oil to make sure they fry evenly.
Once the egg rolls are done, place them on a wire rack to let them drain and cool slightly.
To Bake the Egg Rolls (instead of frying):
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F/220 degrees C. Place the egg rolls on a baking sheet coated with oil or non-stick aluminum foil.
Lightly brush the egg rolls all over with peanut oil or vegetable oil, and bake until golden brown for 15-20 minutes.

On a sheet pan lined with parchment paper, add 24 dollops of peanut butter, each about 1 teaspoon. Place in the freezer and allow to harden for at least 1 hour, but preferably 3 hours. You can also do this overnight.
Preheat your oven to 425 degrees F. In a food processor, pulse the dry ingredients together (2 cups all purpose flour, 1 tablespoon baking powder, ¼ cup sugar, ½ teaspoon salt). Sprinkle in the butter cubes and pulse until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs with a few slightly larger butter lumps, about 12 pulses. If you don’t have a food processor, whisk the dry ingredients together in a bowl, and cut in the butter using 2 butter knives or a pastry blender. Transfer to a large mixing bowl.
Next, process the peanuts until you have a mix of fine and coarse crumbs. Mix with 1 tablespoon of sugar and set aside.
Mix the beaten egg yolk with the sour cream and stir into the dry mixture to make the dough. At this point, if the dough is still dry and not coming together, drizzle in 3 tablespoons of milk 1 tablespoon at a time until the dough is formed (you may not need all 3 tablespoons). Just before the dough fully comes together, sprinkle over the frozen peanut butter chunks.
Gently mix with your hands to bring the dough together and distribute the peanut butter chunks. They’ll smear a little bit, but try to keep them as whole as possible. Do not overwork the dough. As soon as the dough is cohesive enough to form into scones, you’re good to go.
On a floured surface, shape the dough into a square, about 1 inch thick. Cut the large square into 4 smaller squares, and then cut each small square in half on the diagonal to form 8 triangles. Transfer the scones to a parchment lined baking sheet, spaced a couple inches apart.
Using your fingers, make a crosshatch in each scone with your finger. You’re making a “well” to put the jam into. Using a spoon, carefully spoon the jam into the well. If you need to soften your jam to do this, microwave it for 15 seconds to loosen it up. Brush the scones with the 2 tablespoons of milk, avoiding the jelly, and sprinkle with the peanut sugar.

In the meantime, make the filling. In a wok or large skillet over medium high heat, add 3 tablespoons oil and add the ginger. Cook for 30 seconds, until fragrant. Add the onions and stir-fry until translucent.
Add the chopped mushrooms and stir-fry for another 3-5 minutes, until the mushrooms are tender and any liquid released by the mushrooms has cooked off.
Add the cabbage and carrots and stir-fry for another 2 minutes, until the veggies are tender and all the liquid released has been cooked off. Transfer the vegetable mixture to a large mixing bowl and allow to cool.
To the bowl, add the chopped chives, white pepper, sesame oil, shaoxing wine, soy sauce, and sugar. Season with salt to taste (though the soy sauce will usually add enough salt to the filling), and stir in the last 1/4 cup of oil.
To assemble the dumplings, cut the dough into small tablespoon-sized pieces. Roll each out into a circle, and pleat the dumplings (see this post for step-by-step photos on how to fold a dumpling). Continue assembling until you've run out of filling and/or dough.
To cook the dumplings, steam them or pan-fry them. To steam, put the dumplings in a steamer lined with a bamboo mat, cabbage leaf, or cheese cloth, and steam for 15-20 minutes.
To pan-fry, heat 2 tablespoons oil in a non-stick pan over medium high heat. Place the dumplings in the pan and allow to fry for 2 minutes.

You want to leave the more tender parts of the stems, because part of the experience of eating water spinach is the hollow stems, which complement the tender leaves, giving a nice overall crunchy texture.
We like to wash our veggies thoroughly (3 times), and after the last rinse, we give everything a good shake in a large colander to drain the excess water. See our Chinese leafy green vegetables page for a complete description, and tips on how we like to wash our veggies!
Heat your wok over high heat, and add the oil and ginger. Stir for about 10 seconds to let the ginger infuse the oil, and then add the garlic and the XO sauce.
Give the mixture a quick stir--your wok should be close to smoking now, and add the Ong Choy, immediately moving the vegetables around with your spatula. The vegetables should cool the wok a bit, but it is important to stir the vegetables right away, and use a folding motion with your spatula to mix the oil and sauce evenly in with the vegetables.
If the vegetables get too tightly tangled into a ball, just use your wok spatula to spread the vegetables out in an even layer so each piece gets its fair share of oil and sauce. Season with sugar and salt.
After about a minute of stir frying, your vegetables should be coated evenly with the oil and sauce. Next, move the vegetables into a mound in the middle of the wok, keeping the heat on high. This technique is to allow the sides of the wok to super heat, so you can get that elusive “wok hay” signature flavor you taste at your favorite Chinese restaurants.
After about 30 seconds of high heat, there should be some liquid building up at the bottom of the wok--this actually protects your vegetables from burning and produces some steam to help the vegetables cook nicely. Next, use your wok spatula to spread your vegetable mound in a circular motion around the wok to get that searing “wok hay” effect for another 15-30 seconds.

Pour any remaining liquid in the wok into a measuring cup, and add water until you have a total of 1 cup of liquid. Add it to the mixing bowl with the cooked turnip.

Remove the pan from the steamer and let your turnip cake set for about 30 minutes. Once cooled, loosen the sides with a spatula and turn it out onto a cutting board. It should come out quite easily.
Use a sharp knife dipped in water to slice ½-inch thick pieces. I know people who’d enjoy it just like that, but most people pan-fry the turnip cake first.

The next day, rinse the soybeans a couple of times and transfer to a large pot. Add 12 cups of water to the beans, and bring to a boil using high heat and continue to cook for 10 more minutes using medium heat.
Next, blend the soybeans and water in batches until completely smooth. We used our Blendtec’s “smoothie” setting. Transfer the blended soybean mixture to another pot and let simmer for 40 minutes. Watch it carefully, as it’s easy for the soymilk to boil over! Towards the end of the 40 minutes, add salt and sugar to taste (if using), stirring to dissolve.
After 40 minutes, strain the soymilk through a fine cheesecloth. It’s ideal to use cheesecloth, which will result in the cleanest and smoothest soy milk, but you can also use a fine-meshed strainer, as we did. If you use a fine-meshed strainer, you’ll want to let your soy milk settle before using it, as there will be some soybean solids at the bottom of whatever bottle or container you use to store it. This is especially important if you’re using the soymilk for coffee. If you’re using it for baking or to make a Chinese dish like Dou Jiang, a few solids are just fine.
Transfer the soymilk to a bottle, jar, or other airtight container and store in the fridge on the top shelf in the back to preserve it for longer! It’s best to finish it as soon as you can--we wouldn’t recommend keeping it for longer than a few days.

After 1 to 2 hours, drain the liquid from the tofu completely, and let it sit for 5 minutes to drain. Again, remove any standing liquid, gently toss the tofu pieces in the sesame oil and Shaoxing wine.
Next, make the salt and pepper tofu seasoning, and dredge the tofu:
Combine the salt, ground white pepper, Sichuan peppercorn powder, and sand ginger powder. You’ll use half of this salt and pepper spice mix for the tofu coating and the other half to finish the dish in the wok.
Add half of the spice mix to the all-purpose flour and cornstarch, and sprinkle the mixture over the tofu to coat. Flip the tofu pieces over, and sprinkle them with the remainder of the flour mixture. The moist tofu will soak up the dredge, and a batter-like coating will form on the surface. You can add a little more cornstarch if the mixture looks too wet, or if you want the tofu crispier.
Make the crispy garlic:
Heat 4 tablespoons oil in your wok over low heat for 30 seconds. Add the garlic. It should bubble and sizzle very slowly at this low heat and not burn. Be patient, because burnt garlic has a very bitter flavor. Move the garlic around in the oil so it cooks evenly. It’s done when it has turned a light golden brown.
Remove it using a slotted spoon or fine mesh strainer, leaving the oil in the wok. Transfer the garlic to a plate lined with a paper towel.
Pan-fry the tofu & finish the dish:
Heat the oil in the wok over medium-high heat. Place the tofu in the wok in a single layer, and brown the tofu, adjusting the heat as needed. Don’t walk away, as you don’t want to burn the crust! After the tofu starts to brown, flip the tofu to brown the other side. When done, transfer the tofu to a plate.
Use the remaining oil in the wok to coat the sides of the wok, and pour off any excess standing oil to use in another dish.
Turn stove up to medium high heat. Add the sliced long hot green peppers and shallots and Stir-fry for 15-30 seconds. Next, add the warm tofu and gently toss the mixture for another 30 to 60 seconds. Add the scallions, cilantro, and crispy garlic. Continue tossing for another 15 seconds.
Sprinkle the rest of the salt and pepper spice evenly over the tofu and aromatics. It will absorb into the freshly fried tofu for that extra kick. Toss for another 15 seconds, transfer everything to a plate, and serve!",en-US,5.0,,The Woks of Life,95,4 serving(s),1 serving,260 kcal,14 g,10 g,19 g,12 g,,771 mg,2 g,2 g,,

Arrange the tofu on your plate/shallow bowl in two rows. Place the fish filet on top of the tofu. If the fillet is too big for the plate, you can fold the thin tail end and tuck it underneath the rest of the fillet so it fits snugly onto the plate.

Reserve the water they soaked in.
Julienne the bamboo shoots, carrots, and ginger, and set aside. Once the shitake mushrooms are done soaking, squeeze out any excess water, remove the tough stems, and thinly slice them.
With your wok over medium heat, add 3 tablespoons oil. Add the ginger, and cook for 20 seconds. Add the carrots, and stir-fry for 1 minute. Add the mushrooms and bamboo shoots, turn up the heat, and and cook for another 2-3 minutes, until fragrant.
Stir in the Shaoxing wine, light soy sauce, and vegetarian oyster sauce. Continue cooking until all the liquid has reduced. Remove from the wok, and let the filling cool.
Prepare your steamer with enough water for 12 minutes of steaming over high heat, and bring to a boil.
Lay out one of your sheets of bean curd on a clean work surface. Take your mixture of vegetarian oyster sauce and water, and brush lightly onto one of the sheets. Stack another sheet on top and brush that one too with the oyster sauce mixture.
Add half of the filling to the lower part of the bean curd circle (about 5 inches/13 cm) from the edge closest to you), arranging it in a roughly 7x3 inch horizontal rectangle. Fold the sheet over the filling tightly. Fold the sides over the middle, and continue rolling tightly until you’ve formed a rectangular roll. Repeat with another 2 sheets of bean curd skin and the other half of the filling.
With the opening side down, lay them side by side on a heat proof dish. When the water in your steamer has come to a boil, steam the rolls for 12 minutes over high heat.
Meanwhile, mix the braising sauce. Combine 1 ¼ cups of the mushroom soaking water, 1 tablespoon vegetarian oyster sauce, 2 teaspoons sugar, 1 tablespoon Shaoxing wine, 1 tablespoon light soy sauce, 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil and 1/2 teaspoon dark soy sauce. Mix until sugar is completely dissolved, and set aside.
Remove the rolls from the steamer. Heat a clean wok/pan over medium heat. When the wok is heated, add the oil, and swirl it around the perimeter of the wok to coat it evenly.
Add the rolls, and brown each side, about 1-2 minutes per side. Handle gently when flipping.
Once both sides are browned, add the sauce mixture. Braise over medium heat, cooking for 2 minutes covered, and then 2-3 minutes uncovered. Flip the rolls, and do the same on the other side. Try not to move them too much. Just slide them around to prevent them from breaking or fall apart.
Once the sauce has reduced (it should coat the rolls, but they shouldn’t be sitting in a pool of sauce), carefully transfer the rolls to a plate, and cool completely.
Once cooled, slice into ¾ inch thick slices, and garnish with chopped scallions. Serve at room temperature.",en-US,-1.0,,The Woks of Life,270,6 serving(s),1 serving,220 kcal,18 g,5 g,15 g,11 g,,877 mg,5 g,2 g,,

When it’s completely thawed, use your hands to gently squeeze the water from it. Chop the leaves into small pieces. Set aside.
Prepare, the silken tofu by cutting it into ½-inch cubes. Set aside. It can be tricky to keep them in a cube shape since the silken tofu is delicate, so don’t worry if they aren’t perfect.
Heat the chicken stock in a medium pot or wok. Add the salt, sesame oil, and ground white pepper. Let everything come to a slow simmer.
Stir up your cornstarch and water mixture since the cornstarch settles at the bottom of the bowl when left standing. Turn the heat down, and use your metal hoak or soup ladle to stir the soup in a circular motion so the soup is moving and swirling. Slowly drizzle all of the cornstarch slurry into the soup while stirring. The trick to thickening the soup with cornstarch is to turn the heat down slightly and keep the soup moving so the cornstarch does not form clumps.
As you continue stirring, turn the heat back up to get the soup to a very low simmer. Check the soup for seasoning and add more salt if needed. Don’t worry if the soup tastes a little saltier than you’d like at this stage, because the Shepherd’s purse and the silken tofu are both unseasoned.
Simmer the soup for a minute, and add the chopped shepherd’s purse. Stir it gently until the leaves are well distributed.
Next, gently add the silken tofu cubes into the soup, and stir, taking care not to break up the tofu. You want to ensure that the tofu and shepherd’s purse are uniformly distributed in the soup and that both are heated evenly. The soup should start to simmer in about 2 to 4 minutes. At this point, you can add a bit more cornstarch slurry if you like a thicker soup, but keep in mind that the soup will thicken more as it cools.
Beat the egg whites briskly for about 10 seconds until the white is broken up and just starts to bubble.
Next, take your ladle or hoak and move it in a wide, steady swirling motion around the perimeter of the pot or wok until the soup is moving. Slowly drizzle the egg white into the soup.
At this point, adjust the heat so the soup is simmering. Taste the soup again, and season to taste with salt, white pepper, and sesame oil if needed. (Sesame oil and especially white pepper enhances the taste of the Shepherd’s purse, so you can add more or simply put these condiments on the table so they can be added as needed.)

Fry the peanuts in the oil on low heat for 2 minutes, until just starting to turn golden brown. More oil will be fried out of the peanuts, and the mixture will become fragrant.
Add the chili bean sauce to the peanuts and oil, and stir for 30 seconds to bring out the color of the red peppers in the sauce and infuse the oil, which is what you are looking for in this dish.
Next, add the onions and stir fry for 2 minutes on medium low heat until the onion begins to turn translucent.
Add the carrots, five spice tofu, and sugar, and stir fry for another 3 minutes on medium heat. Next, add 1 cup of chicken stock and the blanched pork and continue to stir fry until the liquid has evaporated (about 5 minutes). Add another cup of stock and repeat the stir-frying again until the liquid has evaporated. This continuous stir-fry melds all the flavors together.
Add the remaining 4 cups of stock, and bring it to a boil. Turn the heat down to medium low and simmer for another 30 minutes. Check the mixture every 5 minutes while simmering and give it a stir so the sauce on the side of the wok does not burn. The final sauce should have a cup of liquid and lots of oil.
Boil the noodles according to package directions until al dente. Chewy noodles are always the best for soup!
Divide the noodles and sauce among four bowls. Season with a little bit of salt if needed, and then pour over the water that you used to cook the noodles to create the soup.

This process entails chopping and then folding the shrimp paste over and onto itself, and continuing to chop until you have a paste. We used this same technique in our Dim Sum Stuffed Pepper recipe. Transfer the shrimp paste to a bowl and add in the rest of the filling ingredients. Mix well until combined.
Carefully remove the soft tofu from the carton, draining the excess water. Cut the block in half lengthwise, and cut each half into 5 equal pieces of tofu so you get 10 tofu blocks.
Next, position the tofu slices on a plate or sheet pan. Measure out 2 tablespoons of cornstarch onto a small plate. Next, scoop 1 teaspoon of the filling with a measuring spoon and dip the open end of the spoon onto the cornstarch to coat it. Place a teaspoon of filling onto the middle of each tofu block cornstarch side down. This cornstarch will “glue” the filling onto the tofu. Repeat another 9 times for the other tofu pieces.
Once all the filling is in place, pour the remaining cornstarch into a sieve, and carefully sift the rest evenly over the stuffed tofu. This will give you an extra crispy top-coating.
Heat 4 cups of oil in a wok or small pot to 375 degrees. While you're waiting for the oil to heat up, mix the ingredients for the dipping sauce in a small bowl and set aside.
Use a metal spatula to carefully pick up a block of tofu and slide it into the oil. You can fry them a few at a time, but make sure the oil temperature remains constant. Fry them until golden brown, moving them gently as needed to cook evenly, 2 to 4 minutes. When cooked through, remove them with a slotted spoon or metal spatula to drain on a plate lined with paper towels. You can sprinkle a bit of salt on top if you like, or simply enjoy them with the dipping sauce. Don’t salt the tofu before frying, or it will crack open, and you’ll have a bit of a mess on your hands.

Next, add the oil and cornstarch, mix thoroughly until the pork is coated, and set aside.
Heat your wok over high heat, and spread 2 tablespoons of oil around the wok to evenly coat the surface. Add the tofu slices to the wok in one layer, and let them sear. Don’t move them for a least 1 minute! Tilt your wok so the oil reaches the tofu on all sides. Add more oil if needed.
After another 1 to 2 minutes, the tofu should be browned, and it should not stick to the wok. You may have use a metal spatula to loosen the pieces slightly. Turn down the heat, and carefully flip all of the tofu slices. After the tofu is golden brown on both sides, transfer to a plate. They should be much easier to handle now.
Over high heat, add another 2 tablespoons of oil to your wok. When the wok just starts to smoke a bit, immediately add the pork. Spread the pork around the wok using your metal spatula, and let the meat sear for 20 seconds on one side. Stir fry for another 15 seconds, and scoop out the meat into your marinade bowl. It should be about 80% cooked.
Using the same wok, turn the heat to low, and immediately add 2 tablespoons oil, the minced ginger, the spicy chili bean paste (dou ban jiang), and the white parts of the scallions. Stir this mixture into the oil and let it fry at low heat for 15 seconds to infuse the oil and bring out a rich red color.
Next, add the garlic, black beans, red bell peppers, and the rest of the scallions. Turn the heat to high, and give everything a good stir-frying for 45 seconds. The red pepper will sear and add more natural red color to this dish!
Add the pork and juices from your marinade bowl and the tofu back to the wok. Next, spread 1 tablespoon of Shaoxing wine around the perimeter of the wok, add the sugar, and continue to stir-fry for 15 seconds. Be gentle so you don’t break up the tofu.
After another 15 seconds of stir-frying, spread the hot chicken stock or water around the perimeter of the wok to deglaze it. Continue to stir fry for another 30 seconds, being sure to spread the liquid to the sides of the wok to further deglaze it. (Notice we did not add salt or soy sauce, since the combination of the spicy bean paste and the fermented soybeans is quite salty.)

Carefully tilt the plate and pour off the liquid. This step allows you to remove some of the water content from the very wet silken tofu.
In a tall pot, heat oil to 375 to 400 degrees F. Make sure that the oil is well below the rim of the pot, so the oil does not overflow. It also minimizes splattering. You can use a candy or oil thermometer to check the temperature.
Use a metal spatula or slotted spoon to carefully scoop up one piece at a time and lower it quickly into the hot oil. I suggest frying 3 to 4 pieces at a time, keeping the heat at medium high, because the tofu will cool the oil quickly. You need to maintain that high oil temperature to quickly brown the outside and form a light crust.
Deep fry your silken tofu until light golden brown (about 2 to 3 minutes per batch) and set aside on a dry plate. Oil temperature control is key, as you want to maintain the temperature between 375 and 400 degrees F.
In a bowl, combine the stock, oyster sauce, soy sauces, sesame oil, sugar, and salt together in a bowl and set aside.
Heat your wok over medium heat and add 2 tablespoons of the frying oil around the perimeter of the wok so it is lightly coated. Add the smashed ginger to the wok and stir it in the oil for about 15 seconds. Stir in the minced garlic, the white portion of the scallions, the mushrooms, carrots, and bamboo shoots, and turn the heat up to high.

Continue to stir-fry for another 30 seconds, and add the sauce mixture. Bring the mixture up to a boil. Once boiling, add the cornstarch and water mixture and stir for 15 seconds until the sauce starts to thicken. Add the fried silken tofu and the rest of the scallions.

Soak the red beans in water for 2 to 3 hours, then rinse off and drain.
Add the soaked red beans, 3 ¾ cups water, and baking soda to a medium pot. Cover and bring to a boil, then immediately reduce the heat to a simmer until the beans are softened and opened-up (about 30 minutes). Stir periodically to avoid burning.
If you see a lot of liquid remaining even after the beans are softened and have opened up, turn up the heat, remove the lid, and let the liquid cook off. While you’re doing this, watch the beans closely and stir occasionally to avoid burning. Remove from the heat and let the beans cool for a bit before pureeing the cooked beans in a food processor. You can also use an immersion blender, but a food processor will result in a more even puree.
Put the red bean puree in a thick-bottomed pan set over medium-high heat, and cook off the liquid, stirring constantly. This process will take about 25 to 30 minutes. Add the sugar (about 1/2 cup or to taste) early in the cooking process so it has a chance to fully dissolve.
Towards the end of the cooking time, add the ¼ cup of vegetable oil in two batches. The oil will prevent the puree from sticking to the pan too much. The paste is done once it “stays” in place rather than oozing across the pan. Transfer the paste to a dish, and let it cool before storing it in the refrigerator, covered.
The Night Before: Soak the Rice and Bamboo Leaves:
Rinse the sweet rice a couple of times until the water runs clear rather than cloudy. Next, transfer the rice to a large bowl with enough water so that the water line is ½-inch above the rice. Stir in 1½ tablespoons of lye water and ½ tablespoon vegetable oil. Once the lye water hits the fresh water, both the rice and water will turn a light yellow color––that’s normal. Soak the rice, covered, in the refrigerator overnight.
In a large basin (or your kitchen sink), soak the bamboo leaves overnight. Weigh the leaves down with something heavy to make sure all of the leaves are submerged.
The Next Day: Making and Cooking the Zongzi:
Clean each bamboo leaf, front and back, with a clean kitchen towel, shaking off any excess water and trimming off about a half inch of the bamboo leaf at the base (this part is too tough and rigid to handle). Set aside.
Take the soaked rice out of the refrigerator, and drain off all of the liquid. Set it aside.
Take out the red bean paste, and divide it into 15 equal-sized balls.
Now you’re ready to assemble the zongzi! Take two bamboo leaves and follow the steps shown in the photos, tying them off with kitchen string. Each rice dumpling takes about 2 tablespoons of soaked rice and one portion of red bean paste. Just remember not to tie the string too snugly, as the rice will need room to expand during the cooking process. After unwrapping a zongzi, it shouldn’t look like it has been wearing a pair of pants that’s two sizes too small. :)
In a large pot, arrange the zongzi neatly, and fill the pot with water--about 1-inch above the top of the zongzi. Add 1 ½ teaspoon of lye water to the pot, and place a heat-proof bowl or plate on top of everything to weigh down the zongzi. Bring the water to a boil, and then turn the heat to medium to slow cook the zongzi for 2½ hours. Check the water levels periodically, replenishing the pot with boiling water when the waterline falls below the top of zongzi.
After 2 ½ hours, turn off the heat, and take out the zongzi to let them cool. Serve the zongzi at room temperature with sugar or the syrup of your choice!",en-US,5.0,,The Woks of Life,360,15 serving(s),1 serving,229 kcal,42 g,5 g,4 g,3 g,,43 mg,7 g,3 g,,

Combine the drained rice with 1 ½ cups water, the soy sauces and turmeric powder in a thick-bottomed pot or your rice cooker. Cook the rice per our instructions for perfect stovetop rice or press the button on your rice cooker! If you have not purchased a rice cooker yet and consider yourself a rice-lover, consider purchasing one! Check out our Chinese Cooking Tools page for more information and some useful links to products.
When the rice is cooked, fluff it with a fork or rice paddle. You will see that you now have a nice uniform golden brown rice. You can use this rice fresh or refrigerate it, and use it the next day. If you use cold refrigerated rice, you’ll have to break it up with your hands before cooking as well as add a sprinkling of water and cover your fried rice when cooking to heat it through.
Now onto the “fried” portion of this fried rice. Heat your wok over medium high heat. Add 1 tablespoon of oil, and add the eggs, scrambling them until they’re just cooked. Use your spatula to break up the large pieces into smaller chunks. You can start scooping them up when they look like they are almost done, and put them back into the same bowl you mixed them in. Set aside. You will cook them again in the rice.
Heat the wok until just smoking, and spread 1 tablespoon oil around the perimeter of the wok. Spread the shrimp out in a single layer, and let them sear for 20 seconds. Stir fry the shrimp until opaque, transfer them back to their bowl, and set aside. Again, they’ll get cooked again in the rice! For the record, when cooking large volumes of shrimp fried rice in restaurants, shrimp are usually pre-boiled (like they do for shrimp cocktail). Wok cooks then grab handfuls of the precooked shrimp for each order, which makes the process go quickly and smoothly, but at home, searing the shrimp definitely makes for better flavor!
With the wok over medium high heat, add the third tablespoon of oil, and sauté the onions until translucent.
Add the rice, using your metal spatula to flatten and break up any remaining clumps. If the rice is cold from the refrigerator, continue stir-frying until the rice is warmed up, which will take about 5 minutes, or sprinkle a tablespoon or two of water around the rice, lower the heat slightly, and cover for one minute to let the steam do some of the work.
Once the rice is warmed (this is very important or the sauce will not mix as well and the color of the rice will not be as uniform), add the salt, sugar, sesame oil, and freshly ground white pepper, and mix with a scooping motion until the rice is evenly coated with the seasonings. The rice should be hot by this time. Now add the shrimp and snow peas, and stir fry for another 30 seconds.
Add the eggs and scallions and continue stir-frying the rice for another 30 seconds. Gather all of the rice into the middle of the wok to let the sides of the wok heat up. After about 20 seconds, spread the Shaoxing wine around the perimeter of the wok, and stir-fry for another 20 seconds. This step gives that little extra wok hei that you taste when you get fried rice from a good Chinese restaurant!

Let the rice cool uncovered and use a fork to break it up and fluff it. You can also refrigerate it the night before and when you're ready to use it the next day, rinse your hands in water and carefully break up the clumps of rice.

Brown rice is easy to cook. We have detailed instructions in our post on How to Make Perfect Brown Rice, either on the stove, or in any rice cooker.
If you are making brown rice fresh the same day, let the cooked rice cool completely before using it. It’s best to transfer the rice from the pot to a sheet pan and fluff it with a fork, so it can dry out and cool simultaneously.
Day-old brown rice also works nicely, as cold rice clumps are drier and easily broken apart in the wok. Simply take the brown rice out of the refrigerator, wet your hands with a little water, and break up any clumps so you have individual rice grains. Rinse your hands with a little more water if rice sticks to your hands.
Marinate the meat
If using beef, chicken, or pork, add 1 tablespoon water, 1¼ teaspoons dark mushroom soy sauce, and 1 teaspoon vegetable oil to the meat. Mix until all the liquid is absorbed by the meat to tenderize and add moisture. If you’re using shrimp, just omit the dark mushroom soy sauce.
Next, mix in 1 teaspoon cornstarch and set aside. We made a version with beef, but you can pick any meat of your choosing or go vegetarian with a vegetable fried brown rice.
Prepare sauce
Mixing your sauce ahead of time is much easier than adding everything individually to a hot wok. In a small bowl, mix 2 teaspoons hot water and ¼ teaspoon granulated sugar until dissolved. Stir in ⅛ teaspoon ground white pepper, ½ teaspoon sesame oil, 1 teaspoon dark soy sauce, 1 tablespoon light soy sauce, and ½ teaspoon MSG if using. Set aside.
Scramble eggs
Heat the wok until just smoking. Spread two tablespoons of vegetable oil evenly around the wok, and add the beaten eggs. Turn the heat down and stir the eggs until scrambled. Transfer back to the same bowl, and set aside.
Sear meat
Heat the wok until smoking. Add one tablespoon of vegetable oil. Add the marinated meat to the wok. Spread it out in one single layer, and sear for 30 seconds on each side. Scoop it back into the bowl and set aside.
Stir-fry everything together
With the heat on high, add the chopped onions to the wok (there should be some oil remaining from searing the meat). Cook until translucent. If using fresh carrots, add them at the same time you add the onions. If using frozen carrots, add them after the onions turn translucent.Continue stir frying until the carrots are heated through.
Add the cooked brown rice. Your heat should be really high at this point to prevent sticking. Use your metal wok spatula to stir-fry the rice, scraping from the bottom of the wok to prevent sticking. This is an essential technique for fried rice.
Once the brown rice is warmed (after 1 to 2 minutes of stir-frying), pour the prepared sauce evenly over the rice. Stir fry for another 1-2 minutes to evenly distribute the sauce.
Add in the seared meat. Spread 1 tablespoon of Shaoxing wine around the perimeter of the wok, and give everything a quick stir.
Next, stir in the scrambled eggs. Then, stir in the frozen peas until heated through. Toss in the chopped scallions and stir fry for another 15 seconds. Use a clean spoon to taste the rice, and re-season with more soy sauce or salt if needed.

Wash, rinse, and drain your rice, and prepare it how you would normally either in your rice cooker or using our stovetop rice cooking method.To the rice and water, add the sesame oil, dark soy sauce, soy sauce, salt, turmeric (if using) and MSG (if using). Stir until the rice and seasonings are well-mixed. Cook the rice.
After the rice is cooked, leave it out to cool uncovered for 5 minutes. Fluff the rice with chopsticks or a fork, and turn it out onto a large plate or sheet pan to cool further and dry out slightly. If you cooked the rice properly, you should be able to see individual grains of rice that aren’t too wet.
Prepare vegetables:
Dice and chop all of your vegetables, including the onion, carrots, mushrooms, bell pepper, snow peas, and scallions, ensuring they’re all about the same size. The exception is the mung bean sprouts, which just need to be rinsed, cleaned and trimmed. Set the vegetables aside in neat piles.
Prepare eggs:
Combine the eggs with salt, white pepper, and Shaoxing wine. Beat for 30 seconds.
Heat your wok until it just begins to smoke, and add 2 tablespoons of neutral oil to coat the wok. Pour in the beaten eggs. Scramble them, and when they’re about halfway done, turn off the heat. Use your wok spatula to break the eggs up into smaller pieces, using the residual heat of the wok to just cook them through. Remove from the wok and set aside.
Assemble the vegetable fried rice:
Heat the wok to medium heat and add 2 tablespoons of oil, along with the onion, garlic (if using), and carrots. Stir-fry for 1 minute. Add the mushroom and bell peppers, and continue to stir-fry for another 30 to 60 seconds.
Turn the heat up to high, and add your rice. Immediately begin stir-frying, firmly scraping the contents of the wok from the bottom up to prevent the rice from sticking. After 1 minute, you can pour your sauce evenly over the rice if using leftover day-old rice, and stir it in until the rice is an even color.
Add the white pepper, and keep stir-frying the rice for another minute (about 2 minutes total). You’ll see some steam starting to rise from the rice once it’s heated through. Taste now and add additional seasonings to taste (salt, soy sauce, etc.).
Add the snow peas, and stir-for 15-30 seconds. Add the eggs and mix again until the eggs are incorporated. Add the Shaoxing wine around the perimeter of the wok, and stir it in. Finally, add the bean sprouts and scallions. Stir-fry until the bean sprouts just begin to wilt, and serve.",en-US,5.0,,The Woks of Life,45,4 serving(s),1 serving,439 kcal,60 g,11 g,17 g,12 g,82 mg,817 mg,5 g,3 g,,

Next, put the lobster pieces in a large bowl. Mix the flour and cornstarch together in a bowl and sprinkle it over the lobster. Toss until all the lobster is lightly coated.
Add the sticky rice (after soaking and draining) to a pot of 8 cups of boiling water and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Strain into a colander and give it quick rinse with cool water, and set aside to drain. Use a fork to break the rice up a bit before you add it to the wok to make the stir frying easier.
Heat 2 cups of oil in your wok over medium high heat. When little bubbles form around a bamboo or wooden chopstick dipped in the oil, it’s hot enough! Beat the egg yolks, and drizzle them into the oil to fry. They’ll cook quickly, be ready to immediately pick out the egg using a fine meshed strainer, and set aside.
Using the fine-mesh strainer, make sure there are no egg debris in your frying oil. Turn the heat down to low and fry the garlic at a low temperature (200F), until it’s light golden brown in color. Transfer to a dish using your fine-meshed strainer and set aside.
Now crank up the heat to medium high. When the oil reaches about 375 to 380 degrees F or until *just* smoking, fry the lobster in batches for 30 to 60 seconds for each batch, gently moving the lobster around with your metal wok spatula or until the shells just turn pink. Make sure the lobster is cooked, but not overcooked, or it will be rubbery! You must also let the oil come back up to temperature after each batch since the cold lobster cools down the hot oil significantly.
Drain the lobster pieces of excess oil using a spider or steel strainer and set aside in a large bowl. You can also move them to a wire rack to drain further. You will have leftover oil from frying the lobster, egg yolk and garlic. Pour the oil through a fine mesh strainer into a heatproof bowl. We’ll use some of this for the fried rice, but for the rest, let it cool, refrigerate it, and use it for cooking other recipes! The infused flavors will add good umami to other dishes, and it’s what many restaurants do!
Now it’s time to bring all these elements together. If your wok is on the smaller side, you may want to cook the sticky rice in two batches!
Add 1 tablespoon of the frying oil to the wok set over medium-low heat, and add the chopped ginger. Gently caramelize the ginger, taking extra care not to burn it.
Next, add the Jinhua ham, and let it fry for 30 seconds. You can use dry-cured Virginia ham as a substitute for the Jinhua ham, which is much harder to find! Next, add the chopped red onion, and stir fry for 30 seconds, or until fragrant and just softened.
Add the par-boiled sticky rice and stir-fry for 2 minutes or until reheated. Beat the egg whites with a fork until frothy and pour on top of the rice. Continue stir-frying for another 1 to 2 minutes, or until the rice is coated in the egg white.
Spread the Shaoxing wine around the perimeter of the wok, and add the salt and dark soy sauce. Stir fry until combined, and add the fried egg yolks, the white pepper, and the white parts of the scallions,
Next, add the lobster and any juices from the bowl, and gently fold the lobster into the rice using your wok spatula until well combined. Then add half of the fried garlic and the green parts of the scallions.

(You can do this the night before.)
Now, soak the glutinous rice in a bowl covered with at least an inch of water above the rice for about 2 hours. While the rice is soaking, prepare the meat filling.
Weigh about 13 ounces of lean pork and 3 ounces of pork fat. You can use the techniques from our post on How to Grind Meat without a Meat Grinder in Minutes, and hand-chop the pork very finely.

Divide the dough into four pieces. Working one piece at a time (cover the rest of the dough with a damp cloth to prevent it from drying out), roll the dough into a long rope and cut it into small pieces about the size of an acorn. This method is similar to the one we used for dumpling wrappers.
To assemble the shumai, first prepare the steamer, lining it with a layer of damp cheese cloth, or by brushing it with oil to prevent sticking.
Dust a clean surface with flour and roll out each piece of dough into a small circle about 3.5 inches in diameter. No worries if it’s not perfect. In this case, uneven edges are encouraged. They’ll give you a nice ruffled edge when assembled.

Wash the pork belly and pat it dry with paper towels. Slice it into ¼-inch thick pieces. In a large bowl, mix the sliced pork belly with the minced ginger, Shaoxing wine, fermented bean curd, spicy bean sauce, five spice powder, and sugar. Use your hands to combine everything together well. Cover and marinate for about 1 hour in the refrigerator.
While the pork is marinating, prepare the rice mixture. In a clean, dry wok over medium-low heat, add the long grain rice, sweet rice, Sichuan peppercorns, and the star anise. Cook it for about 5 minutes until the rice turns a light brown color. After 5 minutes, turn off the heat, and let the mixture cool slightly. Next, use a food processor or mortar and pestle to mill the mixture into a coarse grind. When using the food processor, pulse the mixture a couple of times. The rice shouldn’t be too finely ground.
It’s also a great idea to double or triple the rice mixture, and store the leftovers in the refrigerator, so it’s readily available if and when you want to make this dish again. The rice mixture should last a few months in the fridge.
Next, we’ll assemble and cook the dish. Peel the taro skin, rinse, and cut it into pieces roughly the same size as the pork belly pieces. Add the taro to the marinated pork. In a different bowl, mix the ground rice mixture with ½ cup water to create a thick paste. Then combine the rice paste with the marinated pork belly, taro, and 2 teaspoons of light soy sauce. Transfer the mixture to a heat-resistant bowl or casserole dish that will fit into a steamer. Remember that the ground rice will expand after steaming, so make sure the dish is big enough. You can arrange the dish neatly like I did, or not--it won’t affect the taste!
Prepare your steamer, filling it with 2-3 quarts of water. Set the dish in the steamer, and cover it tightly with the lid. Bring the water to a boil using high heat, then turn the heat down to medium low, and steam the pork and taro for 70 to 90 minutes.

The next day, wash and rinse each leaf front and back, keeping them in a large bowl or tub of water until wrapping time so they don’t dry out.
Soak the sweet rice overnight. The next day, drain completely. Mix the soaked, uncooked rice with 2 tablespoons light soy sauce and 2 teaspoons salt in a large bowl and set aside.
Soak the peanuts overnight. The next day, boil for 5 minutes, drain, and set aside.
In a bowl, toss the pork belly with 2 teaspoons light soy sauce, 1/2 teaspoons sugar, 2 teaspoons shaoxing wine, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and white pepper. Marinate overnight. The goal of this step is to make the pork belly slightly too salty, because the rice will absorb the excess salt, giving the zongzi its distinctive savory, umami flavor.
The next day, heat the oil in a wok over medium heat. Cook the pork belly for a few minutes before adding the water. Cover the wok with the lid, and cook for 5-10 minutes until the liquid is gone. Remove from the wok and let cool.
Cut the egg yolks in half. Cut the sausages into 12 equal pieces. Set aside in separate bowls.
Follow the step-by-step photos to wrap the zongzi. Remember: You must cut away at least half an inch off the bottom of every leaf you use. Make sure the kitchen twine won’t break easily. To do this, it’s best to wet the twine first by soaking it in a bowl of water. It’s best to tie one end of the twine to an anchor point or kitchen fixture (e.g. you kitchen sink), because you will only have one hand to tie the zongzi. Your other hand will be holding the zongzi. Or have someone help you out! If leaves rip anywhere during the wrapping process, you’ll need to start over and discard the ripped leaf. That’s why I call for more leaves than is technically needed. Some of the leaves are bound to rip.
To cook the Zongzi, get a medium-sized pot and neatly nest the zongzi inside, avoiding large gaps. Put a large plate directly on top of the zongzi to weigh them down. Fill the pot with cold water, until the zongzi are submerged. Place the pot on the stove over medium high heat. Once the water boils, turn the heat to low/medium-low, and let it simmer for at least 7-8 hours.
The water should be “moving” while simmering, but there should be no large roiling bubbles. You must check the pot fairly often to make sure the zongzi are always submerged in water. Only add boiling water to adjust the water level—do not add room temperature or cold water. Keep a kettle of hot water on the stove so that you’re prepared throughout the 7-8 hour cooking time.

Prep the beaten eggs as well and set them aside. Only when you have all the ingredients prepared and ready to go should you start cooking.
Heat the cooking oil in a wok over medium-high heat. Add the ginger first, stirring for 30 seconds. Then add the garlic. When the garlic is just cooked (before it starts to turn golden), add the cooked rice to the wok, and turn up the heat to high. Stir fry the rice for 3 minutes or so until it's thoroughly combined with the ginger/garlic mixture and/or warmed through if you're using leftover rice.
Now for the flavorings: add the white pepper, fish sauce, soy sauce, and shaoxing wine to the rice. If it's not quite salty enough for you or if you know you won't be eating it with added hot sauce, now is the time to add salt to taste. Stir-fry to combine.
Using your spatula, spread the rice out into an even layer along the surface of the wok. Pour the beaten egg evenly over the rice. Stir the rice until all of the egg is cooked and incorporated.

They should be completely submerged. In a large container, soak the glutinous rice in water, making sure the water level is 3-4 inches above the rice, as it will expand considerably as it soaks. Cut the pork belly into 1-inch x 2-inch chunks. Combine the pork with all the marinade ingredients except the water (the light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, salt, sugar, Shaoxing wine, white pepper, and five-spice powder), and mix everything well. It may seem like a lot of salt, but the rice will absorb the saltiness during the cooking process. If there is no visible liquid after mixing, add water, 2 tablespoons at a time. Pork can soak up a lot of liquid and the liquid will help to keep it moist. The pork marinade should be wet, but without too much liquid pooling at the bottom.
The next day: Completely drain the rice using a fine-meshed colander or sieve. Mix in the rice marinade ingredients (the light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, sugar, and salt), and mix everything well. Set aside, and marinate for about 30 minutes. In the meantime, wash each leaf front and back with a soft cloth, and rinse.

With all fried rice recipes, it's best to use a little bit less water so as to prevent producing a mushy, sticky rice mess that you will not be able to stir-fry properly! After the rice is done, let it cool uncovered. When the steam stops wafting off the fresh-cooked rice, use a fork to fluff the rice up and break it apart. Don’t worry of there are still clumps – you can deal with those in the wok later.
If you refrigerate the rice overnight, it will definitely clump; you can easily break up the cold rice clumps into individual grains with your hands. Just rinse your hands with cold water periodically if they get too sticky during the process.
Heat the wok over medium high heat, and add 1 tablespoon of oil, followed by the beaten eggs. Fold and scramble them gently, taking care not to scorch the eggs. Transfer the eggs back into the original egg bowl and set aside. In a pot of boiling water, blanch the shrimp and drain. Set aside.

If the rice looks a little dry, feel free to sprinkle in some water or chicken stock, or if you want to be a bit more authentic, just a touch more oil (be careful with this—too much water content makes it soggy; too much oil makes it greasy).

I cook the rice per my rice cooker’s sweet rice setting. You can also cook the rice in a pot using our “How to cook rice without a rice cooker” recipe.

Once the rice is cooked, take out your sushi rolling mat, line it with a sheet of clear plastic wrap, scoop out ½ of the rice and carefully flatten it out over the plastic into a thin layer. Wetting your hands with warm water can prevent the rice from sticking to them.

Rinse 2 cups of brown rice. Add enough water to fill the pot an inch above the level of the rice, and let it soak for at least 20 minutes––ideally 90 minutes or even overnight.
When you are ready to cook the rice, pour off all the soaking water from the pot, leaving only the rice. Add fresh water in the same volume as rice. Since we started with two cups of uncooked rice, we added 2 cups of fresh water.
Cover the pot and put on the stove on high heat. Once the liquid comes to a boil, turn the heat to the lowest setting and continue to cook, covered, until all the water has evaporated and the rice is cooked through (about 15 to 20 minutes). Turn off the heat, and let your rice sit covered on the stove for another 10 minutes to finish cooking.
How to Cook Brown Rice in a Rice Cooker
Measure out your rice using the cup that came with the rice cooker! These cups are roughly ¾ of a cup, so using 2 cups results 1½ U.S. standard cups and will yield about 3¾ U.S. cups of brown rice. Give your brown rice a good rinse in the rice cooker pot before cooking and drain.
If your rice cooker has a brown rice setting, add enough water up to the water level lines for brown rice. If you added 2 of the rice cooker cups (1½ standard cups), fill the pot with fresh water up to the 2 cup water line.
If your rice cooker does not have a brown rice setting, add water so the water line is slightly above the 2 cup line. It’s also a good idea to let your rice sit in the rice cooker for an additional 10 minutes after it is “done” without opening the rice cooker lid to let it continue cooking inside the pot.
Let the rice sit in the water for at least 20 minutes, but ideally 90 minutes, before pressing the brown rice button (or regular ""cook"" button).",en-US,5.0,,The Woks of Life,45,4 serving(s),1 serving,344 kcal,72 g,7 g,3 g,1 g,,4 mg,,3 g,,

Next, add the ginger and let fry gently. Add the onions and cook until translucent. When the onions are translucent, add the garlic, jalapenos, and the rest of the spices. Sauteé for a few minutes, stirring to combine. Next, add the tomato purée. Cook for another 1-2 minutes.
Add the entire onion mixture to the soup pot and season with salt. Stir well and let cook for an addition 10-20 minutes. Season with additional salt to taste, and serve with naan on the side!
For the quick garlic naan, grab one store-bought naan, spread some softened butter over one side, then sprinkle the minced garlic and chopped cilantro over the top. Broil in your oven or toaster oven and bake until golden brown and the garlic is slightly crisped. Smear with a little more softened butter when it comes out of the oven, and serve!

Using a rubber spatula, mix and fold the mixture in one direction for about 5 to 10 minutes until it becomes sticky, like a paste.
Prepare a large sheet pan lined with parchment paper. Get a small bowl of cold water. Lastly, bring a small pot of water to a boil, so you can taste-test the filling.
To assemble the wontons, take your square wonton wrapper, dab one side of the square with your finger, and add about a teaspoon of filling in the center. Gently fold the wrapper in half and seal on all sides. Using your finger, brush another dab of water on one corner (of the filling side), and gently bring in and overlap the two corners of the wonton by pressing them together. Place on the parchment-lined sheet pan. Make one more, cook, and taste test the two samples. Make adjustments accordingly to taste before proceeding to make the whole batch.
To cook the wontons, boil water in a pot, and add the wontons (fresh or frozen, but never defrosted wontons). To prevent the wontons from sticking to the bottom of the pot, stir the boiling water gently so the water is moving when you add in the wontons. Cook uncovered for about 3-5 minutes using medium heat. This is also a good time to blanch some leafy greens to complete the meal. If necessary, add ½ cup cold water if the water is boiling too vigorously. This helps manage the starch levels in the water. The wontons are done once they float to the surface and turn plump.
Since it’s best to serve wontons with stock or broth, it’s a good idea to heat up the stock or broth at the same time as you’re cooking the wontons. I like to use chicken broth or a mixture of chicken and pork broth, which you have to prepare ahead of time. More times than not, I just use the water that I cooked the wontons in. This is my trick for when I am in a pinch--you can give it a try too. I first add light soy sauce, sesame oil, ground white pepper, and chopped scallions to the soup bowl.

If you want to include seaweed, you can buy dried seaweed (kelp/kombu) or rehydrated seaweed at your Asian supermarket. Just try to avoid seaweed ""knots,"" as they tend to be a bit sandy. It takes at least 3 hours to rehydrate dried seaweed, so you can soak it the night before. Once soaked, simply wash the seaweed in a basin of water until the water is completely clear. Then drain, and it's ready to add to the pot.
Right before you're ready to start the soup, peel the lotus root and cut it into large chunks (If you do this too early, the lotus root will oxidize, similar to a potato. So hold off until you're about to start cooking).

Combine the 4 oz. julienned pork shoulder with 1 tablespoon water until the meat has absorbed the water. Add a pinch of salt, 2 teaspoons vegetable oil, and 1 teaspoon cornstarch and mix until combined. Set aside.
Prepare your dry ingredients:
Cut the dried chilies in half and discard the seeds. Mince them up and set aside.
In separate bowls, soak the dried lily flowers, wood ears, and shiitake mushrooms in 1 cup of water each for 1-2 hours, until hydrated. Using hot water (like you’re brewing tea) will significantly speed up the process.
Once they’re ready, thinly slice the mushrooms and give the wood ears a rough chop. Trim the tough ends off the lily flowers and cut them in half.
Prepare the tofu and the rest of the ingredients:
Cut both the spiced tofu and the firm tofu into 2-inch long and ¼-inch thick pieces. Julienne the bamboo shoots. Beat the egg in a small bowl. Wash and chop the scallion and set aside.
Assemble the soup:
Bring the chicken stock to a boil in a wok or pot. If the pork has clumped and stuck together, it is best to add another tablespoon of water to loosen it up before adding it to the soup.
Stir in the pork and quickly break up any clumps that may form. Once the soup is simmering again, skim off any foam that floats to the top with a fine meshed strainer.
Add the salt, sugar, dried chili pepper (if using), white pepper, both soy sauces, and sesame oil.
Next, add the lily flowers, wood ears, shiitake mushrooms and bamboo shoots and bring the soup to a simmer once again.
Next, add the two kinds of tofu and the vinegar and stir. It should start to look and smell like the real thing about now!
Combine the ⅓ cup cornstarch with ¼ cup water to make a slurry. Ensure it’s well-combined, as the cornstarch tends to settle to the bottom of the bowl.
Bring the mixture to a simmer and use your soup ladle to stir the soup in a steady circular motion to make a whirlpool while slowly drizzling in the cornstarch slurry. This prevents the cornstarch from clumping. Stop when you’re about ¾ of the way done with your slurry and keep stirring until the soup comes back up to a simmer.
Check the consistency of the soup, as it should be thick enough to coat your spoon or ladle. Add the rest of the cornstarch slurry if you like it thicker.
Adjust seasoning:
Once the soup is the thickness you prefer, use a spoon to check its flavor and adjust things to your own personal preference. Add more white pepper if you like it hot and add more vinegar if like it sour! White pepper gives the soup its signature heat, and the vinegar levels can be adjusted according to how sour you like your hot and sour soup.
Keep the soup simmering (it should be bubbling before you add the egg, or the soup will turn cloudy when the egg is added), and begin stirring in a circular motion with your ladle once again. Once you get the soup moving in a slowly swirling motion, slowly drizzle the beaten egg into the soup.

Put the blanched pork ribs, smashed ginger slices, and 8 cups of water in a clean pot. Bring the water to a boil, and immediately turn the heat down to low. Simmer for 90 minutes, covered. Cantonese soups require low heat for a delicate favor and clear broth. Check on the soup periodically to make sure it is lightly simmering, but not boiling.
In the meantime, prepare the watercress by trimming off the large tough stems, and washing thoroughly in water 2-3 times.
After 90 minutes, stir in 1¼ teaspoons of salt, cover, and simmer for another 30 minutes.
After 30 minutes, give your soup a quick stir, and use a fine-mesh strainer to remove any floating particles. Next, use a ladle to skim off the excess grease that is floating at the top of the soup. Stir in the watercress, cover, and bring up to a simmer. Then lower the heat and cook the soup for 15-30 minutes. I personally like to simmer the watercress soup for 30 minutes at this stage, so the soup takes on that distinctive watercress flavor. Though keep in mind that the watercress will not be as vibrant. Feel free to adjust the cooking time based on your preference.
Season to taste with salt and white pepper. Serve the soup with a hot bowl of rice and a small dish of light soy sauce as a dipping sauce for the pork. After cooking in the soup for so long, the ribs are melt-in-your-mouth tender and perfect with a little soy sauce.

You want the pork to look a little bit like a paste.
To make the wontons, take a wrapper, and add about a teaspoon of filling. Use your finger to coat the edges with water or egg wash (this helps the two sides seal together).
Fold the wonton in half so you have a rectangle shape. Bring together the two outer corners so they overlap slightly, add another drop of water or egg wash, and press to seal.
Keep assembling until all the filling is gone, which should make you about 18 wontons. Like all wonton recipes, you can double or triple the batch, eat some, then freeze the rest for another day. Place the wontons on a baking sheet or plate lined with parchment paper to prevent sticking.
Boil a pot of water for the wontons. While the water is coming to a boil, make the sauce by mixing all of the ingredients together in a small mixing bowl. If you like spicy, add more of the chili peppers and not just the oil from your homemade chili oil. This recipe makes enough for 18 or 20 wontons.
Give the boiling water a good stir and drop the wontons in, being careful not to crowd them. Continue stirring so they do not stick.

Bring a large pot of water to a boil and blanch the vegetables just until wilted, about 60-90 seconds. Drain and rinse in cold water.
Grab a good clump of veg and carefully squeeze out as much water as you can. Very finely chop the vegetables (you can also speed up the process by throwing them in the food processor). Repeat until all the vegetables are chopped.
In a medium bowl, add the finely chopped vegetables, ground pork, 2 1/2 tablespoons sesame oil, pinch of white pepper, 1 tablespoon soy sauce, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1-2 tablespoons Shaoxing wine. Mix very thoroughly until the mixture is totally emulsified—almost like a paste.
Now it’s time to assemble! Fill a small bowl with water. Grab a wrapper and use your finger to moisten the edges of the wrapper. Add a little over a teaspoon of filling to the middle. Fold the wrapper in half and press the two sides together so you get a firm seal.
Hold the bottom two corners of the little rectangle you just made (the side where the filling is) and bring the two corners together. You can use a bit of water to make sure they stick. And that's it!
At this point, you can cook (boil) and taste a couple of wontons and adjust the seasoning of your filling to taste––you can always add a little more Shaoxing wine, soy sauce, sesame oil, salt, and/or white pepper to your liking.
Once you're happy with the flavor of the filling, keep assembling until all the filling is gone. Place the wontons on a baking sheet or plate lined with parchment paper, and make sure they are not touching (this will prevent sticking).
If you'd like to freeze your wontons right away, you can cover the wontons with plastic wrap, put the baking sheet/plate into the freezer, and transfer them to freezer bags once they’re frozen. They’ll keep for a couple of months in the freezer, and be ready for wonton soup whenever you want it.
To make the soup, heat your chicken stock to a simmer and add 2-3 teaspoons sesame oil and white pepper and salt to taste.
Bring a separate pot of water to a boil. Carefully add the wontons one at a time to the pot. Pick up the pot and use a swirling, twisting motion to keep the pot moving and prevent the wontons from sticking to the bottom. If they do stick, don’t worry, They should come free once they’re cooked. Once they're floating, boil them for another 1-2 minutes. Take care not to overcook them – mushy wontons are a sin!

Soak meat/bones for at least 1 hour to get rid of excess blood and impurities. This includes chicken/chicken bones, pork/pork bones, and beef/beef bones, etc. Change the water out 1-2 times, and once soaked, thoroughly rinse clean.
After soaking and washing, you must also blanch the meat/bones. Simply add the meat/bones to a pot along with enough cold water to fully submerge. Bring to a boil, and boil for 1 minute. Drain and rinse under clean running water.
When vegetables are used, it’s important not to cut them too small. It’s best to keep them around 2 in/5 cm. Small pieces of vegetable will dissolve when simmered for a long time and make the soup cloudy.
Simmering:
Always start with cold water along with all the ingredients in the pot. Once it’s been brought to a boil, immediately turn down the heat to simmer. Stay close-by while waiting for it to boil so the soup does not have a chance to boil longer than that.
Here’s how you know if the stock is simmering at the right temperature: there should be a very slow bubbling from the stock. If there’s absolutely no movement in the liquid, the heat is too low and the “cooking” is not happening. If the soup is bubbling quickly, there is too much disturbance in the liquid, and the stock will reduce faster and lose clarity.

Soak your dried shiitake mushrooms in a bowl of hot water for 30 minutes. Place a small plate on top to ensure they’re fully submerged. Cut the stems off the mushrooms and discard them. Return the mushrooms to the water if they still seem dry inside, since thicker mushrooms will take longer to rehydrate. Finely chop the mushrooms and set aside, reserving the soaking water.
Also soak your dried shrimp in hot water for 30 minutes. Strain and rinse them before chopping them. Rinse the salted preserved radish under running water and pat dry before chopping.
Heat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in your wok over medium low heat. Add the dried shrimp and cook until fragrant (about a minute). Next, add the ground pork and stir-fry for 30 seconds, or just until the pork is no longer pink.
Add the chopped Shiitake mushrooms, salted preserved radish, and Shaoxing wine. Stir fry for another 30 seconds. Mix in the sesame oil, salt, sugar, white pepper, oyster sauce, chopped cilantro, chopped scallion and 1 cup of the mushroom soaking liquid.
Cook on medium low heat until simmering, stirring often for 2 to 3 minutes, or until about half of the liquid has evaporated. Next, stir in the cornstarch slurry. Cook until the mixture thickens and all standing liquid cooks off. Set aside, cool, and refrigerate for 30 minutes to an hour.
While the filling cools, make the dough. Mix 3½ cups glutinous rice flour and ½ teaspoon salt in a large bowl. Stir in 1½ cups warm water and mix with chopsticks or a rubber spatula until a dough begins to form. Use your hands to knead until smooth. If the dough is too sticky, simply add more glutinous rice flour 1 tablespoon at a time until the dough forms a smooth ball.
Next, pinch off three small pieces of dough to form three balls about 1 inch in diameter. Cook in a small pot of boiling water until they float, about 6 to 7 minutes. Now, add them to the raw dough, kneading them in until the dough is soft and smooth. I have to admit when I did this, I was slightly worried the dough wouldn’t come together, but give it a few minutes of kneading, and it does!
Now, divide the dough into 24 equal pieces about 32 grams each (a digital kitchen scale helps to ensure each is the same size), Keep them covered with a clean, damp kitchen towel to prevent drying while assembling your Savory Tang Yuan.
Take your filling out of the refrigerator, stirring it to redistribute the ingredients. There should be no visible liquid, and the filling should be somewhat dry.
Use your fingers to form each dough ball into a round disc. Spoon about 1 tablespoon (15 g) of filling on the center of the disc. Use the spoon to lightly pack the filling so there are no air pockets. Fold over the edges of the dough to close the tang yuan, lightly pressing in the savory filling if needed. If the dough breaks, you can use a small piece of dough to patch it, using a little dab of glutinous rice flour and water to spackle it back together. Keep a small bowl of both handy for this purpose.
Next, gently roll the tang yuan between the palms of your hands to shape it into a uniform round ball. Set your finished tang yuan on a piece of parchment paper that has been lightly dusted with glutinous rice flour. Repeat this process until you have made all of the savory tang yuan. You’ll need another clean, damp kitchen cloth to cover them. Repeat these steps until you’ve assembled all the tang yuan.
To cook the tang yuan, boil water in a medium pot (you’ll need at least a 4” depth of water). Use a slotted spoon to gently lower the tang yuan into the boiling water, stirring so they don’t have a chance to stick to the pot. Don’t overfill your pot, as this makes it difficult to cook the tang yuan evenly. Lower the heat to a slow boil.
Cook for 6 to 8 minutes or until your Savory Tang Yuan float to the top, stirring periodically.

Now, form the meatballs. Brush both of your palms with oil to prevent sticking, take a large spoonful of the meat mixture, and roll it into a ball using both palms. The meatballs should be the size of a golf ball. Arrange them on a lightly oiled plate with space between them. Refrigerate while you prepare the rest of the soup.
To assemble the soup:
Soak the glass noodles in cold water for 15 minutes. Drain and cut the noodles in half lengthwise. Set aside.
Trim the winter melon, cutting away the outer ⅛-inch of dark green skin. Rinse and chop into ¼-inch thick chunks.
Place a soup pot over medium heat and add 1 tablespoon oil. Cook the white parts of the scallions for about a minute. Then add 4 cups chicken stock, 2 cups water, and the winter melon. Turn up the heat and bring to a boil.
When the soup is boiling, carefully lower the meatballs into the soup using a spoon. Add in ½ teaspoon ground white pepper and ½ teaspoon sesame oil. Bring to a boil again. Add the glass noodles, stir, and salt to taste.

Gradually add the water to the flour and knead into a smooth dough. This process should take about 10 minutes. Cover with a damp cloth and let the dough rest for an hour.
While the dough is resting, prepare the filling. Start by adding the oil to a small pot over medium high heat. Heat the oil for about 7 minutes and allow it to cool. This ""cooking"" of the oil is supposed to bring out a nuttier flavor in the filling. This tip comes straight to you from Willy's mother, a Beijing local, and an authority on dumpling-making!
Once the oil is cooled, add the ground pork to a large bowl, along with the egg, chives, sesame oil, soy sauce, and cooked, cooled oil. At this point, you should make and boil a test dumpling and try it to make sure the taste is to your liking. You can then adjust by adding more salt if needed.
Once the filling tastes right to you, begin assembling the dumplings. The best way to do this is to divide the dough into manageable pieces and then rolling each piece into a rope. Cut them into small pieces (in a size similar to if you were cutting gnocchi, or about the size of the top part of your thumb).
Roll the pieces out into circles, and add about 1 1/2 teaspoons of filling to the center (it helps if you have an assembly line going, with one person cutting out the dough pieces, one person rolling it out, and one person filling/folding).
You can then make folds like you see in our other dumpling post, or you can just fold the circle in half and press them together. Willy's method is to fold the circle in half, press it together at the top, and then make two folds on either side. Whatever way works for you...they don't have to be pretty to taste good.
Place the dumplings about a centimeter apart on a parchment-lined baking sheet. When you're ready to cook, bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil. Carefully drop the dumplings into the water and keep them moving, so they don't stick to the bottom of the pot. Bring back to a slow boil, and cook until they float to the top and the filling is cooked through (about 5 minutes).

Soak the dried mung bean noodles in warm water (submerge them completely) for 30 minutes. Drain thoroughly, and cut into ¼ inch pieces.
In a large bowl, combine the noodles, ground pork, grated carrot, chopped wood ear mushrooms, shallots, garlic, ginger egg white, fish sauce, vegetable oil, salt, white pepper, and 1 teaspoon sugar. Mix until everything is uniformly combined.
Wrap the spring rolls:
In a large, shallow bowl or deep plate, dissolve the remaining 2 teaspoons sugar in 1 cup warm water. Sugar is optional but does help the spring rolls to brown when frying.
To wrap each roll, place a rice paper wrapper into the sugar water for about 5-10 seconds, making sure it is completely submerged. Remove it from the water. It will still be quite firm, but it will soften quickly!
Place about 40g of filling in a log shape on one side of the wrapper. Begin tightly folding the wrapper over the filling (no air bubbles!), and roll the spring roll forward 1 complete revolution. Lightly press down on each end of the filling to flatten the rice paper and push the filling together to eliminate any air bubbles.
Fold one side of the wrapper towards the middle of the spring roll. Repeat with the other side. Roll the spring roll forward while tucking in the front to prevent air pockets. The rice paper wrapper will stick to itself. It doesn’t require anything additional to seal. Place the rolls on a plate or sheet pan lined with a clean, dry kitchen towel or parchment paper.
Chill:
Once wrapped, transfer the spring rolls to the refrigerator and chill for at least 1 hour, so they can dry out and firm up. This step helps minimize the wrapper bubbling when frying (though bubbling is normal). Take them out of the refrigerator 15 minutes before frying.
Double-fry the spring rolls:
Heat about 3 cups of canola or vegetable oil in a medium pot to 335°F/170°C (the oil level should be a little over halfway up the sides). Fry the spring rolls in small batches—about three at a time. Make sure they do not touch just after they are placed in the oil as the skins will be sticky until a crust forms. Cook each batch for 5 to 6 minutes, or until light golden brown. (Frying them in small batches prevents them from sticking to each other.)
Use a metal slotted spoon to pull them out of the oil. Drain on a rack, and continue frying. Maintain the correct oil temperature by periodically adjusting your heat.
When ready to serve, refry the spring rolls (yes, they need to be fried twice) at 350°F/175°C for 1 ½ to 2 minutes to make them nice and crispy. Double-frying is important!

In a large bowl, stir together the vegetable, meat, wine, oil, sesame oil, salt, soy sauce, white pepper, and 2/3 cup water. Mix for 6-8 minutes, until very well-combined.
To wrap the dumplings, dampen the edges of each circle with some water. Put a little less than a tablespoon of filling in the middle. Fold the circle in half and pinch the wrapper together at the top. Then make two folds on each side, until the dumpling looks like a fan. Make sure it’s completely sealed. Repeat until all the filling is gone, placing the dumplings on a baking sheet lined with parchment. Make sure the dumplings aren’t sticking together.
If you’d like to freeze them, wrap the baking sheets tightly with plastic wrap and put the pans in the freezer. Allow them to freeze overnight. You can then take the sheets out of the freezer, transfer the dumplings to Ziploc bags, and throw them back in the freezer for use later.
To cook the dumplings, boil them or pan-fry them. To boil, simple bring a large pot of water to a boil, drop the dumplings in, and cook until they float to the top and the skins are cooked through, but still slightly al dente.

In a large mixing bowl or mixer with a dough hook attachment, completely dissolve yeast and sugar in lukewarm water. Wait 10-15 minutes to let the yeast become active and foam up.
Add in the flour ½ cup at a time and knead for about 15 minutes. Adjust the last ½ cup flour accordingly. The dough should be soft––not sticky and not too firm. Once the dough is even and smooth, form it into a ball. Cover it with a damp kitchen towel and let it proof one hour in a warm place. (If kneading by hand, knead the dough until it’s as smooth as a baby’s butt!) While it’s proofing, make the filling.
To make the filling:
Add the ground meat to a large mixing bowl and stir in 3 tablespoons water until well incorporated.
Now preheat the wok or a cast iron pan until it starts to smoke lightly. Add in 3 tablespoons oil, along with the minced ginger and diced onion. Cook over medium heat until the onions soften. Add in the ground pork and turn up the heat, stirring to break up any large chunks. Cook until all the pork turns pale and opaque––there is no need to brown or crisp the meat.
Add wine, dark soy sauce, sweet bean sauce, ground bean sauce, oyster sauce, sugar, white pepper, and sesame oil. With the heat on high, stir everything together until well-combined. Taste the filling and adjust seasoning if needed.
Cook for a couple of more minutes to cook off any remaining liquid. Stir in the cornstarch and water mixture, allowing everything to bubble together for 30 seconds to a minute. Turn off the heat and let the filling cool uncovered. After the filling has cooled, mix in the chopped scallions.
To assemble the baozi (buns):
After the dough has finished proofing, turn it out onto a clean surface dusted with flour. Knead for 2 minutes to get rid of any air pockets. Weigh and divide the dough into 20 equal pieces (each should weigh about 48g-50g).
Take each dough ball, and with a rolling pin, roll it from the edge towards the center, without actually rolling the center of the dough. The goal is to flatten the dough into a round circle with a thinner edge and thicker center. The difference in thickness should be about 1:2. Add some filling to the center.
You can start with a smaller amount of filling until you get the hang of the folding/pleating. The buns are folded with one hand holding the skin and filling, and the other hand pleating the edges of the dough disk like an accordion. As you fold, the goal is to make it all the way around the circle, until you’ve sealed it at the top. You’ll be making about 10-15 folds. Lay the buns on a small piece of parchment paper and put it directly on your steaming rack. Repeat until all are assembled. Let the buns proof (covered) for another 15 minutes before steaming.
If you’d rather not pleat the buns at all, simply pinch the edges of dough around the filling and pinch to seal tightly. Then simply flip the buns seam side down, cover, and proof for 15 minutes.
To steam:
With the buns in the steamer, start with cold water and turn on the heat to medium. Set the timer to 15 minutes.
After 15 minutes, turn off the heat, and keep the lid on. Let the buns “rest” for 5 minutes before opening the lid. Missing this step will cause the buns to collapse.
To store leftovers and reheat:
Once the buns are steamed and cooled completely, pack them in an airtight container. They can be refrigerated or frozen.
Out of the refrigerator, simply microwave the buns for 1-2 minutes. Alternatively, re-steam them for 5 minutes. If re-heating frozen buns, there’s no need to thaw beforehand.

Place the pot over medium heat, and bring the mixture to a simmer, stirring to dissolve the sugar. The process should only take a few minutes. Shut off the heat and allow to cool completely.
While waiting for the sauce to cool, rinse the pork belly and pat dry thoroughly with paper towels. The pork should be as dry as possible. Arrange the pieces neatly in a shallow, rimmed dish.
Once the sauce has completely cooled, stir in the baijiu or whiskey. Pour the mixture over the pork, making sure the meat is completely submerged. You can even put a clean plate or bowl on top to weight down the meat. Cover tightly and refrigerate for 3 full days, flipping the pork belly once each day to ensure the sauce penetrates the meat evenly.
After 3 days, it’s time to hang them up to cure. Use kitchen string and a bamboo skewer to thread the string through the fat in the pork belly. Tie a knot to make a sturdy loop, and hang the pork belly in a cool dry place. I used our basement, which has optimal temperature and humidity levels (you want the temperature to remain around 50-55 degrees F, and the relative humidity should be around 65%. I kept the window open during the day to let in fresh air. Note: this cured pork belly is best made during the colder months!
Layer some newspaper on the floor to catch any liquid that drips from the pork, and let it dry for 4-6 days until the outer layer is completely dry and the inside is still slightly soft when pressed. To store, put in a freezer bag with as much air removed as possible.
To prepare this pork belly in the most simple (and delicious) way, just add rice and water to your rice cooker as you normally would to cook a batch of white rice.

Set aside for 30 minutes.
Next, make the sauce. Add 1 teaspoon of oil, ginger slices, and star anise to a small saucepan over medium heat, and cook until the ginger starts to caramelize (about 1 minute). Next, add the ketchup. When that starts to sizzle, stir constantly until the ketchup starts to caramelize (about 2 minutes). Take care not to burn the aromatics and ketchup--this step is essential to give the sauce a deeper, more complex flavor.
Next, add the white vinegar, sugar, and the juice from the canned pineapple. Stir until the mixture starts to simmer, and the sugar is dissolved. Turn to the lowest heat and let the sauce simmer and reduce until the sauce just starts to coat a spoon (about 30 minutes). The sauce needs this time for the flavors to meld. The sauce can be cooled and stored at this time, and you can double or triple the amount and store the sauce away in the refrigerator for future meals.
Heat 3 cups of oil to 350F in a small pot for frying. Using a small pot and frying in batches leaves you with less leftover oil to deal with. Always let the oil cool completely and use a fine mesh strainer to strain the oil before storing in the refrigerator.
Mix together the dredging ingredients (flour, cornstarch, salt and pepper) in a shallow dish. Dredge the pork pieces in the flour mixture, dip into the egg, and then dredge with the flour again.
Fry the pieces in batches for about 2 to 3 minutes, or when they just start to get golden brown. Remove them from the oil and transfer to a sheet pan with a slotted spoon or spider.
Once you’re ready to combine everything, refry the pork in batches to crisp up the coating. That's right, they're going to fry for a second time––this prevents the pork from getting too soggy when added to the sauce.
To a clean wok, add 1 tablespoon oil, the bell peppers, and onions. Stir-fry for 30 seconds, and add the sauce and the pineapple. Bring the mixture to a simmer to further thicken the sauce. At this time, you will likely need to add some cornstarch slurry to thicken the sauce further. Add half first and stir for 15 seconds; then decide if you need more. Remember the sauce will thicken more as it cools in the plate, so add only as much as you need.
I have to add another note to this recipe that this sauce is very sweet and very pungent! So at this point, you must taste the sauce and add water to it if it is too strong and by that, I mean too sweet or too sour. Once you have it adjusted to your taste and the desired thickness, especially if you added more water, then go ahead to the next step and add the pork.

For this step, you need: 5 grams instant dry yeast, 1 teaspoon sugar, 1 ½ cups lukewarm water, and 4 cups all-purpose flour, plus extra for rolling.
In a large mixing bowl or mixer with a dough hook attachment, completely dissolve yeast and sugar in the lukewarm water. Add the flour and knead for about 15 minutes. The dough should be pretty soft and not too firm. If it seems dry, add a little more water. Cover the mixing bowl with a damp kitchen towel and let it proof one hour. While it’s proofing, make the filling:
Step 2: Make the Filling
Combine the following and mix for a few minutes, until the meat mixture resembles a fine paste, then set aside: 1 cup ground pork, 1 teaspoon sesame oil, 1 tablespoon light soy sauce, 3 tablespoons oil, ¼ teaspoon ground white pepper, ¼ teaspoon salt.
Then heat a couple tablespoons of oil in a pan over medium heat and cook the grated carrots (4 cups) for a few minutes until they turn color (they shouldn’t be mushy. Cook until they’re just not raw anymore). Let cool completely.
Combine the pork mixture, the cooked carrots, and the following ingredients: 1 cup chopped scallion, 2 teaspoons grated ginger, 1 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon sesame oil, and 1 teaspoon shaoxing wine. Mix for a couple minutes, until the entire mixture resembles a paste.
Step 3: Assemble the Baozi
After the dough has finished proofing, turn it out on a clean surface dusted with flour. Knead for 2 minutes to get ride of any air pockets. Roll the dough into a long tube and rip off chunks of dough to make individual dough balls. They should be about the size of a golf ball for larger buns, and about half that size for smaller buns.
Take each dough ball, and with a rolling pin, roll from the edge towards the center, without actually rolling the center of the dough. The goal is to flatten the dough into a round circle with a thinner edge and thicker center. The difference in thickness should be about 1:2. Add some filling to the center of each disk (about 1 ½ tablespoons for the larger buns and 2 teaspoons for the smaller ones).
You can start with a smaller amount of filling until you get the hang of the folding. The buns are folded with one hand holding the skin and filling, and the other hand pleating the edges of the dough disk like an accordion. As you fold, the goal is to make it all the way around the circle, until you’ve sealed it at the top. You’ll be making about 10-15 folds. Lay the buns on a floured surface while you finish assembling them. Once assembled, let the buns proof under a clean kitchen towel for another 15 minutes before cooking or freezing.
To freeze, lay the buns on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and put the baking sheet in the freezer. Once the buns are frozen, transfer them to a Ziploc bag, press out as much air as you can from the bag, and freeze for up to two months (to be honest, they'll even last longer than that). To cook, just follow the directions below as if you were cooking them fresh. The cooking times will just be a little longer!
Step 4: Cook!
There are 2 ways to cook your baozi: steaming and pan-frying, or “sheng jian.”
To steam:
I used a double-leveled bamboo steamer. You can use whatever steaming apparatus you normally use, but remember: 1) Boiling water should not directly touch the buns during steaming 2) Avoid sticking by brushing oil on the surface the bun sits on or by laying down some kind of natural nonstick surface. In our case, we used corn husks. Thin napa cabbage leaves will work too. If using a bamboo steamer, brush the sides of the steamer with oil, as the buns expand and might stick to the sides. 3) The surface that the buns sit on should not be solid, like a plate. This will trap moisture and make the buns soggy. There should be some aeration going on. 4) Make sure the lid is tight so you don’t lose any steam.
Start with cold water, and put your buns on the steamer. Turn on the heat to medium. Set the timer for 12-15 minutes for smaller buns and 15-20 minutes for the larger ones. To see if the buns are cooked, press the buns lightly with your finger. If the surface of the dough bounces right back, then they’re done. Keep a close eye on them. Over steaming will cause the buns to collapse, so cooking time is important.
Turn off the heat, keep the lid on, and let the buns “rest” for about 2 minutes before taking them out and eating.
To pan-fry:
Pre-heat a flat-bottomed cast-iron or other seasoned pan over medium heat. Add a couple tablespoons oil and swirl around the pan to coat it evenly. Add the buns to the pan, and let them cook for a few minutes until the bottoms turn golden brown. Once golden, add about 1/4 cup water to the pan and immediately cover with a lid. Turn the heat down to medium low and let the buns steam for 7-10 minutes until all the water is evaporated. Uncover the lid, and toss the buns with scallion and sesame seeds.

Next, prepare the sauce--mix all of the sauce ingredients together and set aside.
Now we can start cooking! To prevent sticking, preheat a clean wok until it starts to smoke lightly (this step is very important). Now turn up the heat to high, and add one tablespoon of oil to the wok. Cook the marinated pork just until it turns opaque. Turn off the heat, transfer the pork to a dish, and set aside.
At this stage, your wok should still be pretty clean, as the technique used to cook the pork is fairly low impact. But if it’s not, it’s a good idea to wash the wok and wipe it dry before starting the next phase of cooking.
Turn the heat on to medium. Add two tablespoons of oil and the spicy bean sauce. Stir lightly, and cook for about a minute until the oil turns red, adjusting the heat to avoid burning if needed.
Now add the ginger, garlic, and dried chili peppers. Stir for about 15 seconds. Add the wood ears, turn up the heat, and stir fry for 30 seconds (you can add a few drops of water if it’s too dry), making sure everything is well-combined.

Don’t trim any excess fat, as it will render off and add flavor.
Combine the sugar, salt, five spice powder, white pepper, sesame oil, wine, soy sauce, hoisin sauce, molasses, food coloring (if using), and garlic in a bowl to make the marinade (i.e. the BBQ sauce).
Reserve about 2 tablespoons of marinade and set it aside. Rub the pork with the rest of the marinade in a large bowl or baking dish. Cover and refrigerate overnight, or at least 8 hours. Cover and store the reserved marinade in the fridge as well.
Preheat your oven to 'bake' at 475 F (246 C) with a rack positioned in the upper third of the oven. (If you only have a convection oven, keep in mind the oven not only heats more quickly, your char siu will roast faster than what we have described here). It's amazing how oven temperatures can vary—from model to model, in different spots in the oven, and in how ovens pre-heat and maintain heat. Using an oven thermometer to double-check the actual oven temperature is a great safeguard to monitor your food (I say double-check because even oven thermostat calibrations vary and can sometimes be incorrect). Regardless, be sure to check your char siu every 10 minutes, reducing or increasing the temperature as needed.
Line a sheet pan with foil and place a metal rack on top. Using the metal rack keeps the pork off of the pan and allows it to roast more evenly, like it does in commercial ovens described above. Place the pork on the rack, leaving as much space as possible between pieces. Pour 1 ½ cups water into the pan below the rack. This prevents any drippings from burning or smoking.
Transfer the pork to your preheated oven. Roast for 25 minutes, keeping the oven setting at 475 F for the first 10 minutes of roasting, and then reduce your oven temperature to 375 F (190 C). After 25 minutes, flip the pork. If the bottom of the pan is dry, add another cup of water. Turn the pan 180 degrees to ensure even roasting. Roast another 15 minutes. Throughout the roasting time, check your char siu often (every 10 minutes) and reduce the oven temperature if it looks like it is burning!
Meanwhile, combine the reserved marinade with the maltose or honey (maltose is very viscous––you can heat it up in the microwave to make it easier to work with) and 1 tablespoon hot water. This will be the sauce you’ll use for basting the pork.
After 40 minutes of total roasting time, baste the pork, flip it, and baste the other side as well. Roast for a final 10 minutes.
By now, the pork has cooked for 50 minutes total. It should be cooked through and caramelized on top. If it’s not caramelized to your liking, you can turn the broiler on for a couple minutes to crisp the outside and add some color/flavor. Be sure not to walk away during this process, since the sweet char siu BBQ sauce can burn if left unattended. You can also use a meat thermometer to check if the internal temperature of the pork has reached 160 degrees F. (Update: USDA recommends that pork should be cooked to 145 degrees F with a 3 minute resting time)

In a small pot, add the pork skin and pork bones and cover with cold water. Bring to a rolling boil, and immediately drain and rinse off the bones and the skin. This gets rid of any impurities. Rinse out the pot and put everything back in. Add 4 cups (950 ml) water, ginger, scallion and wine. Bring the pot to a boil and then reduce the heat to low. Cover and simmer for 2 hours.
After 2 hours, turn off the heat, allow the soup to cool, and strain the liquid into a bowl. Once the liquid is completely cooled, cover and refrigerate overnight.
The Dough:
In a mixing bowl, add the flour and the warm water 1 tablespoon at a time. Work and knead the dough for 15-20 minutes. The dough should be very soft and smooth. Cover with a cloth and let it rest for 30 minutes.
The Filling:
Take your ground pork and put it in the food processor. Pulse for 30-60 seconds until the pork resembles paste. In a mixing bowl, add the pork and the rest of the ingredients except the aspic. Whip everything together thoroughly, for about 2 minutes. You want everything to be extremely well combined, and the pork should look like a light, airy paste. Gently fold in the diced aspic, and do not over-mix. Cover and transfer the filling to the refrigerator until ready to make the dumplings. If you’re ready now, you can put it in the freezer for 15 minutes to allow it to firm up and make assembling the buns easier.
Assembly:
Lightly dust a clean work surface with flour and roll the dough into a long cylinder/cigar, about an inch in diameter. Cut the dough into small equal pieces weighing about 11 grams each (the dough chunks should be a size resembling that of gnocchi). Roll out each piece into a round disc about 3 - 3 ¼ inches diameter. Keep everything under a damp cloth.
Prepare your bamboo steamer. You can line it with cheese cloth, napa cabbage leaves, or these lovely bamboo steamer discs, which can be found in some Chinese restaurant supply stores (if using these, you must brush the discs with oil first!).
When all that is prepared, take out the filling. You’ll be making each bun one at a time. Place about 1 tablespoon of filling in the middle of your dumpling skin. Pleat with as many folds as you can muster: 12-20 folds should do it. Make sure the top is sealed. If the filling ever gets too wet or hard to handle, put it in the freezer for another 15 minutes and start again.
Place the buns in the lined steamer basket, about 2 inches apart.
Steaming:
In a metal steamer pot or wok, boil water. If using a wok, put the water at a level so that when you put the bamboo steamer into the wok, the water rises about ½ inch up the bottom of the bamboo base. You never want the water to touch the dumplings inside, though, so make sure not to fill it too high!
Once the water is boiling, put the bamboo steamer in the wok or steamer pot, cover with the bamboo steamer lid, and steam over high heat for 8 minutes. Immediately remove the bamboo steamer from the pot and serve.
Eating:
Ok, so there is definitely a proper way to enjoy these dumplings. Put away the soy sauce because it has no place on the table right now. What you want is Chinese black vinegar. Pour some out into a small, round dish or bowl, and top with some very thin matchsticks of ginger.
Take out your two utensils—chopsticks and a Chinese soup spoon (a fork would just butcher these and the soup would dribble out all over the table. It would be a tragedy of Shakespearean proportions).
Carefully, slowly peel the xiaolongbao off of the steamer basket and dip it into the vinegar.

Finely chop the mushrooms. Also mince the ginger and finely chop the scallions, separating the green and white parts.
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a wok over medium heat. Cook the shiitake mushrooms until caramelized, about 4-5 minutes (don’t stir too often; give the mushrooms a chance to caramelize). Don’t overcook the mushrooms, or they’ll turn dry. Set aside and cool completely.
In a large mixing bowl, add the ground pork, chopped scallion whites, minced ginger, Shaoxing wine, light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, sugar, sesame oil, and white pepper. Mix it all together, and whip everything in one direction for 5 minutes. While you’re whipping the filling, add the water 1 tablespoon at a time, until the filling becomes a thick paste, with no standing liquid.
Add the cooled shiitake mushrooms, and keep stirring in one direction for another 3 minutes, until everything is well-combined.
Assemble the dish:
Take each gluten ball, and use a chopstick to poke a hole at a thin/soft spot without penetrating through to the other side. With care, use two chopsticks in a turning motion to make the opening bigger, about 3/8” in diameter and no more than ½”. Use the chopsticks to gently deconstruct the inner “structure” of the gluten ball to make room for the filling, while keeping it intact.
Stuff the gluten ball with the filling a little at a time until there is no more room, all the while keeping the gluten ball whole. Repeat until all are stuffed. This step definitely takes patience and care!
At this point, you’ll have filling left over. However, by now, the filling already inside the gluten balls will have moistened and further broken down the inner structure, creating space for more filling. So repeat the above step and stuff more filling into each ball. You should be able to divide and use up all the filling. If not, pan-fry any remaining filling in a meat patty for a little snack. An under-stuffed gluten ball will not be as round after cooking, but there’s no harm done!
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a wok over low heat. Add the sugar, ginger and scallions, and cook for 1-2 minutes, until the sugar has melted and the aromatics are fragrant.
Add the Shaoxing wine, light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, oyster sauce, 1 star anise, and 2 ½ cups water. Bring to a boil, and then reduce the heat to medium.
Add the stuffed gluten balls, with the openings facing down. Cover, bring to a boil, and reduce the heat to medium low. Simmer for 10 minutes, carefully flipping the gluten balls halfway through the simmering process to ensure they’re cooked evenly.
After 10 minutes, flip the gluten balls so the openings face down once again. Turn up the heat to reduce the sauce. Once the sauce has become a thin gravy (you should have about 3/4 cup of sauce left in the wok), turn off the heat and serve.

(Set aside the pork stock you have now created and use it for a ramen or noodle soup or cooking stock later!)
While the pork is cooking, chop the cilantro and scallion and set them aside separately. Finely mince the garlic cloves or use a garlic press and set that aside. Chop your peanuts and set them aside as well.

Once peeled, rinse them clean and wipe them thoroughly dry. Lightly smash each chunk with the side of a knife or other flat, heavy tool.
In a clean, dry wok over medium heat, cook the ginger for 10 minutes. Be careful not to burn it. If any of the ginger burns, trim away the burnt spots, or the finished dish will be bitter.
Add the ginger chunks to a large non-reactive cooking vessel, along with the two types of vinegar. Cover and bring to a boil. Once boiling, turn the heat down to medium. Simmer for 90 minutes. This is a good time to taste the vinegar mixture––free feel to add more black vinegar for tartness.
While the vinegar and ginger are simmering, take a separate pot and add the pork. Cover it with cold water, and add 2 tablespoons Shaoxing wine. Bring to a boil and boil for an additional 3 minutes. Turn off the heat, drain, and rinse the pork. Set aside.
Once the vinegar and ginger have simmered for 90 minutes, stir in the pork. (If you prepared the vinegar and ginger base in advance, bring it to a boil before adding the pork.)
Cover and cook for another 60-90 minutes over medium heat. You’ll know it’s done when you can easily poke through the pork skin with a chopstick.
While the pig trotters and pork knuckles are cooking, boil the eggs. We came across this rigorously tested method Serious Eats. Bring 3 quarts of water to a boil in a large pot (it sounds like a lot, but it helps get the eggs to the right temperature to be easy to peel). Lower the eggs into the boiling water, and boil for 30 seconds. Cover the pot, reduce the heat to low, and simmer for 11 minutes. Transfer to a bowl of ice water. Once cool, tap the eggs against the counter all over to crack the shell, and peel under a thin stream of running water.

Heat the sugar and water in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir to dissolve the sugar. Once it’s boiling, add the lemon juice, stir, and immediately turn the heat down to low.
Keep the lid off, and let the syrup simmer for about 60 to 70 minutes until the sugary liquid turns a light amber color. Do not stir during this timeframe! By now, the liquid might look too watery, but it will thicken once it’s cooled. Try not to overcook it, because it will become thick like caramel. (Just in case you do overcook the syrup, and it’s too thick, add a few drops of hot water to thin it out. Keep adding the hot water until you get the right consistency.)
Now, pour the syrup into a heatproof container, and cool completely before storing it in the refrigerator.
PART II: The dough
First, mix the inverted sugar syrup, oil, and lye water together. Then add the flour to the mixture, using a rubber spatula to fold and combine everything into a soft dough.
Do not overwork the dough. This step should only take about a minute or two. Cover the dough in an airtight container or wrap it in plastic wrap. Let it rest in the refrigerator for at least an hour to make it easier to work with. You can also refrigerate the dough overnight if you’d like to make it ahead of time.
PART III: The ham and nut filling
Steam the ham in a heatproof bowl for 15 minutes. You will end up with some liquid in the bowl after it’s done steaming. Save this liquid and set it aside. Finely chop the ham.
If you’re using pre-toasted nuts, you can save some time. If not, toast the raw nuts in a preheated oven at 325 degrees F for 5-10 minutes with each batch. Roast the walnuts, cashews, and pecans together, and roast the pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and sesame seeds in a separate batch. My tip is that once you smell a nutty aroma after 3-4 minutes, stand in front of the oven until the nuts are toasted to your liking. Don’t walk away from the oven, because the nuts can burn quickly! Once cool enough to handle, chop the walnuts, cashews, and pecans, and add them to a large mixing bowl along with the toasted pumpkin, sunflower, and sesame seeds.
In a clean, dry wok, toast the sweet rice flour for 15 to 20 minutes over medium low heat until it turns a light brown color. Stir often, and adjust the heat accordingly to prevent burning.
In a small pot, heat up the oil until it’s lightly smoking. Turn off the heat, and let it cool. Believe it or not, cooking the oil this way adds fragrance and flavor to the mooncakes!
To your mixing bowl full of chopped nuts and seeds, add the chopped ham, currants, sugar, salt, and five spice powder. Mix well. Now add in the liquids: the water from steaming the ham, the bai jiu, the “cooked” peanut oil, and the water. Stir everything to combine.
Lastly, slowly add in the toasted sweet rice flour to bind all the ingredients together. The final mixture should be somewhat dry and slightly crumbly, but you should be able to squeeze everything together tightly and form a ball. If you need to, add a little bit more peanut oil to moisten the mixture.
Weigh and divide the mixture into 18 equal pieces. Form each piece into a ball, and set aside for assembling the mooncakes.
Part IV: Assembling the mooncakes
After the dough is done resting, divide it into 18 equal pieces. My mooncake mold holds 100 grams, which means that each mooncake should weigh about 100 grams after assembly. You should be able to use these guidelines when assembling the mooncakes:
Each dough ball is around 25 to 30 grams. Set aside a smaller dough ball for scraps and mending, which I will get to. Shape each piece into a ball.
Each ball of filling should be around 65 to 70 grams.
Let’s start assembling the mooncakes by preparing the mooncake mold. My mooncake mold came with four pattern plates––one plate should be attached to the mold itself. Wrap another one with clear plastic, because you’ll use it to press the mooncake from the bottom. Now, dust the inside of the mold with plenty of flour, and shake off the excess. You’ll need to repeat this process before pressing every mooncake to avoid sticking.
Dust the balls of dough with flour. Take one ball of dough, and roll it out on a floured surface into a 4-inch round. Put one piece of filling in the center. Carefully lift it up (I use a dough cutter to scrape it up from my work surface), and gently press out the air bubbles without breaking the dough. Next, make sure the opening is facing up, and slowly pinch the dough closed around the filling, keeping the distribution of the dough as even as possible.
The dough feels like Play-doh, so it’s easy to break, but it’s also easy to squish back together. These instructions might sound confusing, but follow along with the pictures, and keep in mind that the chief goal here is to close the dough around the filling without any air pockets. Now dust the assembled ball with additional flour.
Place the ball of dough and filling inside the mooncake mold with the mold opening facing up. Next, press in the bottom piece (with the clear plastic-wrapped plate that you prepared). With some pressure, gently press it inward.
Quickly put the mold down, and press the mooncake out with the top pressure bar. The bottom piece will come out no problem, but use your other hand to VERY GENTLY guide the mooncake out of the mold. When/if a small piece of dough gets stuck and does not come out, get a small piece of your scrap dough to patch up the area. Then clean the mold, and dust it well with flour again. Next, gently flatten all sides of the mooncake to make it smaller, so it can go back in the mooncake mold for re-shaping. Use slightly more flour for dusting if this becomes a persistent issue. Place the mooncakes on a baking sheet as you make them.
PART V: Baking the mooncakes
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F, and put the baking rack in the middle of the oven when you’re almost finished assembling the mooncakes. Once the oven is preheated, gently mist the mooncakes with a food-grade spray bottle (if you have one) filled with water. If you don’t have one, you can just use your hands. Dip your fingers into a bowl of water, and fling the water on your fingers onto the mooncakes a couple of times. This prevents the dough from cracking in the hot oven.
Then, immediately put the mooncakes in the oven, and bake for 5 minutes. (Remember to set the timer!) Now, prepare the egg wash by whisking together an egg yolk with 3 tablespoons of water.
After the mooncakes have been baking for 5 minutes, take them out of the oven and immediately lower the oven temperature to 300 degrees. Using a natural-bristle pastry brush, lightly brush each mooncake with egg wash, and put them back in the oven.
Bake them for another 15 minutes (set a timer!). When the time has elapsed, take them out, and let them cool completely. When the mooncakes first come out of the oven, the dough will look dry like bread, and not oily like what you are used to when opening packaged mooncakes. This is normal.
Store the completely cooled mooncakes in an airtight container for a day or two, and the outside will get that sheen that you recognize and love.",en-US,5.0,,The Woks of Life,3000,18 serving(s),1 serving,450 kcal,52 g,9 g,25 g,3 g,14 mg,182 mg,29 g,3 g,,

Add the all-purpose flour to the bowl of an electric mixer. With the mixer on low, slowly add the water. Run the mixer until the dough comes together into a smooth ball. 2 cups of water is a baseline. You may need less water in humid climates and more in drier climates/times of year (i.e. winter).
The finished dough should be soft and pliable, but not wet or sticky. Cover with an overturned bowl or plate, and let the dough rest on the counter for 1 hour. This gives the flour more time to absorb moisture, which will make the dough smoother and easier to work with. While the dough is resting, make the filling.
Take a spoon and scrape the fish meat a little bit at a time, discarding the tough membrane that’s left behind. Coarsely chop the fish (no need to make it into a paste-like texture at this stage). Add the fish to a large mixing bowl along with the rest of the filling ingredients. Whip in one direction using chopsticks or a wooden spoon for a good 5 minutes until the filling becomes gooey and sticky. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for 15 minutes.
Now we are ready to assemble the dumplings! When the dough is done resting, cut it into eighths. Take one of your smaller pieces of dough, keeping the rest of the pieces covered to prevent them from drying out. Roll the small piece of dough into a thick cylinder on a clean and lightly floured surface. Cut the cylinder into 10-gram pieces using a kitchen scale. Now take one piece, and roll it from edge to center with a small rolling pin as you turn the dough in a circular motion. The end result is a 3-inch diameter dumpling wrapper that has thinner edges and a slightly thicker center.
Add about a tablespoon of filling to the center, and fold the wrapper in half. Position the dumpling so that each side is held in place by your thumb and index finger (this is a two-handed operation). Then with gentle pressure, press the two sides of the wrappers closed tightly. At the same time, press the filling slightly downward, by bringing your wrists slightly closer. Practice will make perfect! Place the dumplings on a sheet pan lined with parchment paper.
Before you go too far down the road of making the dumplings, now is a good time to pause for a taste test. Boil a small pot of water just as you’re beginning to assemble the dumplings, and cook 2-3 test dumplings according to the cooking instructions below. Taste and adjust the seasoning accordingly before proceeding with the rest of the batch! You may want more Shaoxing wine, more vinegar, more ginger, or more soy sauce, for example.
Before cooking the dumplings, assemble the dipping sauce by combining all the sauce ingredients in a small bowl.
To cook the dumplings, make sure to cook them in small batches, since the filling is somewhat wet and the dumplings will loose their shape when left sitting for too long.
Fill a large soup pot halfway with water. Bring it to a boil. Add the dumplings, stirring the water slowly as you add them to prevent them from sticking to each other. Keep the pot uncovered.
Bring the water to a boil again, and then add 1 additional cup of cold water to stop the boiling process. As the pot of water continues to rise in temperature, repeat this previous step 3 until the dumplings are floating to the surface. The dumplings are cooked once the water has boiled after three instances of adding cold water. Scoop them out with a strainer or slotted spoon, and enjoy them right away with the dipping sauce.

Add the pork skin and bones to a thick-bottomed medium pot with just enough water to cover them. Bring to a boil, and boil for 1 minute. Turn off the heat, and rinse the pork skin and bones under running water to clean them. Clean the pot as well.
Trim away all the fat under the pork skin and cut into very thin slices. This makes it easier for the collagen to release.
Fill the clean pot with 3 cups of water. Add the pork skin and bones, along with the Shaoxing wine, ginger, and scallion. Bring to a boil, and lower the heat to medium low. Simmer for 1 hour. (It should bubble gently at a low simmer).
After 1 hour, the pork skin should be very tender, and the stock should look thick and almost milky. Strain to remove all solids, and add salt to taste. Let the liquid solidify in a covered container in the refrigerator overnight.
This should yield 1½ cups of aspic, the perfect amount for this recipe.
THE DAY OF/NIGHT BEFORE: Make the filling
In a large bowl, combine the ground pork, Shaoxing wine, salt, sesame oil, sugar, water, dark soy sauce, light soy sauce, ground white-pepper, grated ginger, and minced scallions. Whip in one direction for 5 minutes until it has the texture of a thick paste.
Dice the aspic into ¼-inch cubes. Carefully stir it into the filling to evenly distribute. Transfer the bowl to the refrigerator. Chill for at least 1 hour, preferably 1 ½ - 2 hours while you make the dough.
1 ½ TO 2 HOURS BEFORE SERVING: Make the dough
In the bowl of an electric mixer, add the cake flour, all purpose flour, salt, and instant yeast. Attach the dough hook, and turn the mixer on to the lowest setting. Slowly stream in the water. Knead the dough for 10 minutes until smooth. The dough should be soft but hold its shape.
Shape the dough into a smooth ball, brush the top with oil, and cover the mixing bowl with a plate. Proof at room temperature for 30 minutes.
Assemble the buns:
These buns will go straight into the pan as you assemble them, so prepare the pan first by lightly oiling it with a neutral flavored cooking oil. A wide non-stick pan works best. A cast-iron pan also works, but can be more challenging when it comes to preventing the buns from sticking. You’ll need to pre-heat it until it’s just smoking, cover it with a thin layer of cooking oil, and let it cool completely. Now you’re ready to assemble your buns.
Once the dough finishes proofing, knead it for 3 minutes on the lowest setting of your stand mixer. (If kneading by hand, knead for 5 minutes.) Remove ⅓ of the dough, and keep the rest covered to prevent it from drying out.
When you’re ready to start rolling out the dough, take your filling out of the refrigerator. If it’s warm in your kitchen (especially in the summertime), rest the bowl of filling in an ice bath to keep it cold while you assemble the buns.
On a clean and lightly-floured surface, roll the dough into a long tube and cut it into small 20 gram pieces, measured with a kitchen scale. Keep in mind, this recipe makes about 30 buns, so your piece of dough (⅓ of the total) should divide into ten 20g pieces.
Take each piece, roll it into a round ball, and press to flatten. Roll it out using a rolling pin from edge to center, rotating the dough as you roll. You should have a 4-inch round wrapper where the edges are thinner than the center.
Add about 2 tablespoons of filling in the center, and pleat to close the top. Make sure you keep your fingers as clean as possible during this process. Wet or greasy fingers make it challenging to seal the buns.
As you make the buns, arrange them in your pre-oiled pan. Placing them pleated-side down is traditional, but only do this if you're confident that your buns are well shaped and sealed. If not, place them pleated side up! Each bun should have half an inch of surrounding clearance. (You'll see I put them a bit closer together in my pan, which made them more difficult to separate!)
Pan-fry the buns:
Once the pan is filled with your first batch of buns, immediately move it to the stove, and turn on the heat to medium. Add enough oil such that the buns are sitting in about ⅛-inch of oil.
As the oil heats up, move the pan around so the edges of the pan are also heated. The oil should start bubbling lightly all around the pan as the buns slowly begin to shallow-fry. DO NOT be tempted to turn up the heat. We don’t want to burn the bottoms. Also, at this point, DO NOT touch the buns with any kitchen tool WHATSOEVER. They can be easily damaged, as they are not yet set.
After about 8-10 minutes, the oil should be bubbling evenly. The bottom edges of the buns should be beginning to brown lightly, and the buns will expand a little as they cook.
At this stage, add enough water so it comes up about ½ an inch (1.25 cm) in the pan. The water should come up about a third of buns’ height. Immediately cover the pan with a tight-fitting lid, and cook for another 8-10 minutes on medium-low heat.
Next, uncover the pan. The water should be mostly gone. Sprinkle the sesame seeds and chopped scallions over the top, put the lid back on, and cook for another 5 minutes over medium-low heat. (If there’s still a significant amount of water left in the pan at this point, you can turn up the heat slightly, but do take care not to burn the buns.)
The buns are done once you’ve cooked off all the water and the bottoms are golden brown. Use a dull kitchen tool to remove the buns, and avoid puncturing them. A stiff rubber spatula works well.

1612,How to Cut Whole Pork Shoulder,Bill,https://thewoksoflife.com/how-to-cut-pork-shoulder/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/how-to-break-down-pork-shoulder-14.jpg,['1 whole pork picnic shoulder'],"Preparation:
In your kitchen sink, carefully remove the pork shoulder from the packaging. There is almost always excess liquid to drain off. Gently rinse the pork shoulder (avoid splashing water around, and be sure to disinfect the area afterwards). Pat dry with a paper towel and transfer the pork shoulder to a large cutting board.
De-boning:
Position the pork shoulder with the large skin side down and the broad side facing away from you. You can see the inside bone poking through both ends.
Find the seam/muscle membrane that runs from one end of the bone to the other and use your fingers to separate and pull the meat apart. Carefully make small cuts in the seam until the membrane pulls apart.
Continue to cut along the bone from the broad end of the pork shoulder over to the tapered end to fully expose it. Note that the bone is not straight, but bent at an angle. Gently pull the meat apart, and cut around and down the lengths of bone. Pulling the meat creates tension, which makes cutting through the membrane around the bone easier. Take your time with it!
Soon, you’ll see that you’ve sort of “flattened” the pork shoulder, and the bone will be clearly exposed. Continue to cut around the bone until you can get your fingers under it. Next, lift the bone and slide your knife tip under it. Cut under and around the bone to separate it from the meat.
Now grip the detached end of the bone and continue to cut the meat around the bone until the bone is completely separated from the meat. Lifting the bone up and letting the neat hang down creates tension between the meat and bone that makes cutting the meat away from the bone easier.
Breakdown:
Find other muscle membranes, and cut between the membrane/seams to separate the pieces of meat. You’ll find that the thickest pork chunk on the broad end of the roast works well for stir fries, since it is quite lean. Cut along the seam of this large chunk until you get to the skin, and continue to cut and separate the meat from the skin until the large pork chunk is detached. (Before stir-frying, trim off the muscle membrane and fat to ensure you get tender slices.)
Continue to find and cut along membranes and seams until you have separated most of the pork chunks from the middle, and near the narrow part of the pork on the leg. The medium pieces can be cut into chunks for stewing, used to make ground pork, or even butterflied for char siu.
Now you should have skin and fat on one side and a thinner cut of fat and meat that resembles pork belly on the other side. Cut off the portion that has only skin and fat and reserve.
Now you’ll be left with what resembles pork belly––a long piece with layers of fat, meat and skin––along with some remaining chunks of pork. Remove the pork belly piece, and continue cutting along the seams to separate the remaining pork chunks.",en-US,5.0,,The Woks of Life,20,None,,,,,,,,,,,,

There’s no need to stir too much or whip the mixture in any way, or the filling will turn rubbery. Cover and set aside in the fridge.
For the soft dough, add the flour, sugar, and lard to a mixing bowl, and mix until thoroughly combined. Then slowly add the water in 3-4 batches and knead the dough to form a smooth dough ball. Set it aside and cover with a damp cloth. Make sure the dough is not too dry. To test for quality, form a dough ball and press it flat. The edges should not crack.
For the pastry dough, combine the flour and lard and knead to form a dough ball. Cover with clear plastic wrap and let it sit in fridge for 20 minutes.
To assemble the mooncakes, divide both the soft dough and the pastry dough into 24 pieces each. You should have 48 bits of dough in total. Take the time to divide them equally and roll each into balls. We used a scale to help us out. Cover all the dough pieces with a damp paper towel to prevent them from drying out as you work.
Take one piece of soft dough and press into a small round disc. Put a piece of the pastry dough in the center of the soft dough, close to seal, and use your palms to flatten.
Then roll it out into a long oval shape. Roll that into a more uniform cigar shape. Roll the cigar out lengthwise into a longer rope, and then roll it into a tight, short bundle.
Stand the bundle up and press it flat. With a rolling pin, roll the dough bundle out into a 3½-inch disc (it should be slightly thinner around the outer edges and thicker in the middle).
Add about one tablespoon (about 20 grams) of meat filling to the center of the disc, and seal tightly. Be careful with the filling—you can’t overstuff these or they will burst open during the baking process.
Now lightly press the dough to shape it into a flat moon cake shape. Place it on a baking sheet seam side down. Now, repeat with the remaining pieces of dough and filling until you’ve used everything up. You will need two baking sheets for a total of 24 moon cakes.

1615,Chinese Rib Tips: Fall Apart Tender Takeout-Style,Bill,https://thewoksoflife.com/rib-tips-chinese-takeout-bbq/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/chinese-rib-tips-2.jpg,"['3 pounds pork rib tips ((1.4 kg))', '3 tablespoons maltose ((mixed in 1 tablespoon of hot water; can substitute honey))', '5 cloves garlic ((minced))', '¼ cup hoisin sauce', '4 ½ teaspoons salt', '¼ cup sugar', '1 tablespoon five spice powder', '3 tablespoons Shaoxing wine', '2 tablespoons ketchup', '¼ teaspoon red food coloring ((optional, but if you really want to go for that “authentic” look…))']","Rinse the pork rib tips, and pat dry with paper towels.
In a large mixing bowl, combine the maltose with the hot water using a spatula. Maltose is VERY thick and sticky, so the hot water helps to loosen and liquefy it so it’s easier to work with and can serve as the base of your marinade. You may mistake the stuff for super glue. You can use your hands to soften it faster, but a spatula works fine too. Microwaving the maltose for 10 seconds softens it up also. Working with maltose is admittedly a bit difficult, but the rich stickiness really makes it worth the extra steps! If you can’t find maltose, we’d love to hear your kitchen experiments with honey or agave as substitutes in the comments!
Add the garlic, hoisin sauce, salt, sugar, five spice powder, Shaoxing wine, ketchup, and red food coloring, if using.
Next, add the rib tip pieces to the bowl, rubbing the BBQ sauce into the meat and ensuring that it’s completely coated. You can cut the rib tips into smaller pieces but I leave them whole to ensure they’ll be tender and juicy. Cover the bowl with a large plate or plastic wrap and let the rib tips marinate overnight in the refrigerator (12 to 24 hours).
After the ribs are marinated, remove them from the refrigerator for 1 to 2 hours, letting them come up to room temperature. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Line a sheet pan or roasting pan with parchment paper or non-stick foil to prevent the ribs from sticking to the pan. Place the two slabs of rib tips on the pan, cover with foil, and place them in the oven. Save the marinating liquid for basting.
Bake the ribs for 30 minutes, baste them, turn them over, and baste again. Cover again with the foil. Return them to the oven and reduce the temperature to 275 degrees F.
Repeat the process two times––that’s 60 minutes of additional cooking time. After 90 minutes in the oven, baste again, and return to the oven uncovered.
Baste the ribs every 20 minutes for another hour until done. At this point, if you like a slightly crispy bark on the rib tips, increase the oven temperature back to 325 degrees F. Add 2 tablespoons of water to the pan around the perimeter of the rib tips if it starts to dry out and burn.
Carefully transfer the rib tips to a cutting board. I wasn’t kidding when I said they would be fall-apart tender!

Place the pork belly in a medium pot, and fill it with just enough water to cover it. Bring the water to a boil. Once the pork has gone opaque and appears cooked on the outside, shut off the heat, remove the pork from the pot, and rinse it clean under running water. Dump out the water and clean the pot.
Put the pork belly back in the clean pot, and add 3 cups of water, the Shaoxing wine, rock sugar, light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, scallions, ginger, star anise, cinnamon, black cardamom, galangal, Sichuan peppercorns, and bay leaves. Bring everything to a boil, then immediately turn down the heat to low and simmer for 90 minutes to 2 hours, until fork tender. To test it, stick a fork into the meat. It’s done if you can pull the fork out easily. Do not use high heat when simmering to avoid drying out the sauce. Add salt to taste.
While the pork is simmering, make the buns. To a mixing bowl, add the flour, yeast, and salt. Slowly add the warm water, mixing and kneading until it forms a smooth dough ball. Once a dough ball is formed, knead it for another 10 minutes to build up the gluten in the dough--this will make the buns chewier. You can also use an electric mixer with the dough hook attachment for this. The dough should feel soft and easy to work with. Cover the dough, and let it proof at room temperature for about an hour until it doubles in size.
After proofing, knead the dough for about 5 minutes to get rid of any air bubbles. Divide the dough into 12 equal pieces. Cover the dough balls with a kitchen towel to prevent them from drying out while you’re shaping the buns.
To shape the buns, take each dough ball and roll it out into a cigar-like shape. Next, roll it out into a longer and narrower strip, and fold it in half lengthwise. Roll it up into a bundle, with the loose end tucked underneath. Turn it on its side so the swirls are facing up, and press it down with your palm. Now roll it out into a disc about 4 inches in diameter. Repeat these steps for all of the dough balls. Cover the shaped buns with a dry kitchen towel, and let rest for 20 minutes before cooking.
Pre-heat a flat-bottomed pan or cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Place the buns in the pan about an inch apart (no oil is necessary). Cover the lid, and let the buns cook for 2 minutes on each side. The heat shouldn’t be too high, or your buns may burn. After cooking the buns for 2 minutes on each side, remove the lid, and cook each side for another minute or so until the entire bun is golden brown.
To serve, take out the pork, coarsely chop it, and transfer it to a bowl. Mix in the chopped cilantro, and add the sauce from the meat to your desired consistency.

Using your hands, work the mixture into the pork ribs until they are well coated. Marinate anywhere from 2 hours to overnight.
If you refrigerate the pork ribs overnight, let them come up to room temperature before cooking. When you’re ready to fry, pour 3 or more cups of peanut or vegetable oil into a small to medium pot—enough so you have 2-3 inches of oil. Heat your frying oil to 300 degrees F/150 degrees C.

Make sure everything is well-combined. Next, add the cornstarch to the ribs and mix until a paste forms that evenly coats the ribs.
When the oil reaches frying temperature—either via your thermometer, or when a rib dipped in the oil sizzles strongly—deep fry the pork ribs in small batches, about 4-6 pieces at a time. Use a slotted spoon to separate them as soon as you place them in the oil to avoid sticking and ensure even cooking.
Turn up the heat once you drop in the ribs, as the oil will cool. As you fry, continue to adjust the heat lower or higher as needed to maintain temperature. The pork ribs should fry fairly quickly, about 5-7 minutes.

Turn the heat down to medium and add the shallots and garlic. Stir-fry for another minute and add the Shaoxing wine, ground bean sauce, hoisin sauce, soy sauce, salt, five spice powder, white pepper, and sesame oil. Stir-fry the ribs for another minute.
Add the chicken stock, bring to a boil, and adjust the heat to a slow simmer. Cover and cook for 45 minutes, checking and stirring the mixture every 10 minutes. The ribs should be submerged in the liquid at the beginning and the sauce should reduce slightly but the braised pork ribs should still look a little soupy at the end of the 45 minutes so add more water or chicken stock if needed.
While the ribs are cooking, heat ½ cup vegetable oil to 300 degrees F in a wok or cast iron pan and add the taro, spreading the pieces out so there is a single layer. Fry on each side until they just start to turn brown and have a slight crust on them, about a minute on each side. Drain the excess oil and toss the taro with a large pinch of salt. This process give the taro a light crust and prevents it from becoming mushy after cooking with the ribs.
Once the ribs have been simmering for 45 minutes, they should be tender. There should be quite a bit of standing liquid remaining. Add the taro, and gently fold the mixture together to coat the taro pieces with liquid. Let cook for another 15 minutes, giving everything a gentle stir every 2-3 minutes.

While the pork is marinating, prepare a small pot with oil and have it ready to fry the ribs. The oil should be at least 1.5” deep, so the ribs can be submerged under the oil when frying. Using a smaller pot requires less oil, and you’ll have to fry the ribs in a few batches.
Once the ribs are marinated, sprinkle the cornstarch over the ribs to evenly coat them. I used a ziplock bag to toss the ribs with the cornstarch and get an even coating.
Heat the oil over medium heat. It's ready when you stick a chopstick in it and small bubbles form around the tip of the chopstick. Slowly lower the ribs into the oil, making sure to leave some space between each rib so that they fry evenly.

Using a food processor, pulse the scallops about 6-7 times, in 3 batches, until they resemble short, fine threads. Next, pulse the shrimp about 7-8 times, or until they resemble coarse crumbs. Mince the ham by hand--best to avoid your expensive jinhua ham from resembling cat food!
Collect the water from steaming the scallops (whatever dripped off into the bowl that the scallops were in while you were steaming––the amount will vary each time you do it, and that’s fine), and mix with 1¾ cups chicken stock and 2 tablespoons brown sugar. Set aside.
In a large wok, heat your 7 cups of oil to 225 degrees F--it’s hot enough when a chopstick dipped in the oil bubbles slightly. The oil temperature for the duration of the cooking process can vacillate between 200 and 250 degrees F, or on your stovetop, between medium-high and high heat, depending on what you are adding to the oil and how much. If your wok is too small for safe frying, use any other large, deep pot. A dutch oven would also work well.
Add all of the scallops and let fry for 5 minutes. Next, add the shrimp. Fry the mixture for 15 minutes. Next, add the ham and cook for an additional 3 minutes. Add the chopped chili peppers and cook for an additional 3 minutes.
Turn off the heat. Using a fine-meshed strainer, transfer the seafood mixture to another large skillet or wok, letting the oil drain off.
Turn the heat on again and let the oil come back up to 225F. Add the shallots. Let fry for 10 minutes. They should become slightly golden but not crispy.
While that’s happening, heat your second wok over medium-high heat. Add the last 6 tablespoons of Shaoxing wine, the 2 tablespoons of dark mushroom soy sauce, and the sugar/chicken stock mixture you prepared earlier. Stir to combine, and simmer to let the liquid cook off.
Next, add the garlic to the shallots and cook for 10 minutes, keeping an eye on your second wok. The garlic should get golden and slightly crisped.
When the liquid has cooked off in your seafood mixture and the shallot/garlic mixture is the correct color, carefully pour the seafood mixture back into the main wok. Lower the heat to medium and stir to combine. Add the fish sauce and chili flakes, stirring to combine.
Transfer to clean, sterile containers, and let cool on the counters before refrigerating. You can eat the XO sauce right away or you can let the flavors meld for 2 to 3 days before digging in!

There is a technique to cutting pork that I learned from my father. First, find where the meat has the fat and the membrane between the muscle, and use a sharp knife to cut and separate them. My father always said that if you look at the pork closely, it will show you how it wants to be cut by following the muscle membrane lines. This is a brilliant way to do it, because you end up with the fat and the tougher membrane on the outside, protecting the tender meat and keeping it juicy on the grill. The marinade and heat also break down this membrane, so it won’t be tough at all.
Once you have your pieces of meat separated, you can decide if they need to be cut further into manageable pieces since grilling involves more handling and moving/turning of the meat than roasting in the oven. You will most likely have to butterfly the thicker pieces of the meat to get the desired thickness. Always start where the meat starts to be thicker; cut towards and into the thickest part, stop 1½ inches from the end and butterfly the meat. This method for breaking down the pork also applies to roasting Chinese BBQ pork in the oven. I included some pictures and details since we got quite a few questions after posting the oven-roasted version.
Mix all of the marinade ingredients in a bowl and mix well. Place the pork into a gallon zip top bag, and pour the marinade mix in. Seal the bag and work the marinade into the meat until every piece is evenly coated. Refrigerate overnight.
The next day, place the pork on a plate, making sure to shake off the excess marinade in the bag. Too much marinade left on the meat will increase the chances of burning your pork. Pour the rest of the marinade into a bowl and add the rest of the basting ingredients; get your basting brush ready.
Preheat your grill, making sure it's extremely hot. You want a nice sear on the meat to seal in the juices before you turn it, but try not to get it too crispy on one side. You will be turning the meat often during the cooking process to prevent burning and make sure that marinade gets nice and caramelized. On a hot grill, you should be cooking it for about 3 minutes before flipping it.
After both sides are seared, you can turn the grill down slightly to prevent drying out the meat. Turn the meat often; I did every 2 to 3 minutes making sure to get an even sear on all sides. I also started to brush and baste the meat after each turn to keep it moist and flavorful. If the meat looks like it starts to get dry on the surface, it needs to be basted.
Continue this turning and basting for another 20 to 30 minutes and make sure you don’t walk away from the grill! With all of this marinade, the roast pork could burn to a crisp very quickly, so protect your time and investment! Also make sure that you stop basting a few minutes before you pull the meat off the grill since the marinade was in contact with raw meat.
You can check the pork with a meat thermometer to be sure it’s done (145 degrees F), and remove it from the grill to let it rest for 5 minutes before slicing.

Rinse them under cold running water to remove any bone fragments and other impurities (be sure to disinfect the sink after you’re done). To avoid curling during frying, make 1-inch cuts around the perimeter of the pork chop, about 1-2 inches apart. After that, use a rolling pin to hammer the chops to a ½-inch thickness. It can help to put some parchment paper on top of the chops to prevent splatter.
Add them to a large bowl, and add the grated garlic, 3 tablespoons water, salt, sugar, white pepper, five spice powder, light soy sauce, wine, and 1 teaspoon potato starch. Mix thoroughly to coat the pork chops. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours or overnight.
While your pork chops are marinating, you’ll want to prepare some other items. First, the tea eggs—if you’re only letting your pork chops marinate for 3 hours, you’ll need to make the tea eggs the night before (you could also make plain hard-boiled eggs if pressed for time). You can also wash and chop the napa cabbage, and prepare your mustard green ingredients. You’ll also need to make rice!
When you’re ready to fry the pork chops, add the additional ½ cup water and ½ cup potato starch to the pork chops, and toss them until they’re evenly coated in the resulting paste. In a cast iron skillet or Dutch oven, add about ¾ inch oil, and heat over medium high heat. When some of the marinade dipped into the hot oil sizzles vigorously, you’re ready to fry.
Fry the pork chops one at a time, carefully lowering them into the hot oil so they lay completely flat. Fry for about 3 minutes on each side, lowering the heat to medium if needed (i.e. if the pork chops are getting too dark). Repeat with all four pork chops.
When you’re on the third or fourth pork chop, if you are able, we recommend getting some kitchen help and sauteeing the mustard greens. Add 1 tablespoon oil to a hot wok until just smoking. Break the dried chili pepper in half and add it to the oil with the garlic. After 20 seconds, add the mustard greens and sugar. Stir until heated through (they should not take on any color). This quick process should take about 4-5 minutes.
You’ll also need to stir-fry your choice of greens. Add another couple tablespoons oil to your wok, and heat until it’s just smoking. Add the ginger and garlic, let sizzle for 10-20 seconds, and follow with the cabbage. Cook until the cabbage is wilted, and season with salt to taste.

When the oil starts to pool, you can scoop it out and strain it into a clean, heat-proof jar or container. You can do this gradually as the lard builds up. The whole process will take about an hour. Once it’s done, the rendered pork fat will be a light golden color.
Once the lard is cooled, cover and store it in the refrigerator. The fat will solidify and turn the loveliest creamy white color, and you’ll have plenty of lard to keep in the refrigerator for a few months.

Cover with a damp cloth and let it rest for 2 hours. (I haven't forgotten about the baking powder. You'll add that later!)
While the dough is resting, make the meat filling. Heat the oil in a wok over medium high heat. Add the onion and stir-fry for a minute.

If you can’t find these bamboo leaves, then you can use parchment paper as a substitute.
Soak your dried shiitake mushrooms in a bowl of hot water and place a small plate on top to ensure they are fully submerged for 30 minutes. Cut the stems off the mushrooms and discard them. Return the mushrooms to the water if they still seem dry inside, since thicker mushrooms will take longer to rehydrate. Finely chop the mushrooms and set aside, reserving the water you used to soak them.
Soak your dried shrimp in hot water for 30 minutes. Pour the shrimp out into a strainer and give them a quick rinse before chopping them.
Heat 5 tablespoons (75 ml) vegetable oil in a frying pan or wok on medium low heat. Scoop out about 2 tablespoons of the heated oil and set aside for brushing the cha guo after they come out of the steamer.
Add the dried shrimp to the oil and stir-fry until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Next, add the ground pork and stir-fry for another 30 seconds, or until it is opaque. Stir in the chopped shiitake mushrooms and the Shaoxing wine.
Next, add the grated daikon radish, chopped scallions, sesame oil, oyster sauce, 1 1/4 teaspoons salt, sugar, and white pepper. Cook on medium low heat until simmering and continue to simmer for another 3 to 4 minutes, or until the daikon radish is just tender.
Combine 2 teaspoons cornstarch with 1/4 cup of the reserved mushroom soaking liquid, being careful to avoid any dirt or sediment that may have settled on the bottom of the bowl. Add to the wok, and continue to cook and stir until all standing liquid has evaporated, about 2 minutes. Set aside and let cool completely.
In a large mixing bowl, combine the glutinous rice flour, all purpose flour, tapioca starch, and the remaining 1 teaspoon salt. Gradually stir 2 cups of boiling water into the dry mixture and continue mixing with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon until a dough begins to form. Once the mixture is cool enough to touch, knead the dough into a smooth ball. Add extra glutinous rice flour 1 tablespoon at a time if the dough is too sticky to knead. Once smooth, cover the dough in the bowl with an overturned plate, and let it rest for 20 minutes.
NOTE: Don’t be thrown off by the amount of dough in the photographs. I made half a batch of dough in these photos, because I decided to freeze the other half of the filling to save for Chinese New Year, when I’ll be making another half batch of fresh dough!
Divide the dough into 24 equal pieces about 45 g each, and keep them covered with a clean, damp kitchen towel to keep them from drying out while assembling the cha guo. I recommend using a digital scale to keep the cha guo rice cakes uniform in size.
Press each small ball of dough to form a flat disc. Use a rolling pin to roll out the edges of the disc until it is about 3 ½ to 4 inches in diameter. It’s important to make the edges of the disc slightly thinner than the middle, or you will have too much dough on one side after you pinch and close the edges.
Next, put 35 g of filling in the middle of the dough disc. Use a spoon to press the filling together into ball so there are no air pockets in the filling. Here, you can again use your kitchen scale to measure how much filling you are using for each cha guo rice cake in order to achieve a uniform size.
Next, pinch the dough around the edges of the disc until the opening is closed. The side of the cha guo tea cake you just closed will be the bottom, so no need to worry if the seam is not smooth. Just make sure it is closed and does not leak.
Next, brush your reserved “cooked” vegetable oil on one of your cut zong leaves and also on the bottom of the cha guo, and place the cha guo onto the leaf. Gently press until it is flattened slightly.
Place the cha guo in a bamboo steamer or metal steamer, ensuring that there is at least an inch of space between each one. You should be able to fit 4 to 5 cha guo rice cakes on one level. Stack your bamboo steamer levels to steam more tea cakes in one batch. Steam your cha guo rice tea cakes in batches for 10 minutes each.
Once done, sprinkle a pinch of toasted sesame seeds on top of each rice cake and gently press them in place. Use a basting brush to lightly brush some of the cooked oil you reserved earlier over each cha guo to prevent them from drying out.
Remove the cha guo to a plate and serve them warm anytime! You can also let them cool completely and freeze them on a plate, placing a layer of plastic or parchment paper between each layer.

In a clean, dry wok or cast iron skillet over medium heat, add the sea salt and Sichuan peppercorns. Stir the mixture for 25-30 minutes, until the salt starts to turn light brown. BE VERY CAREFUL during this process. Although there isn’t much indication in the form of steam or smoke from the mixture as you stir, the sea salt does get extremely hot, so handle with care! Once the sea salt turns light brown, turn off the heat, and let the mixture cool.
Now rinse the pork belly under cold water, and pat it thoroughly dry with paper towels. Once the sea salt mixture has cooled, but is still warm to the touch, remove ⅓ cup and set it aside. Place the pork belly on a rimmed sheet pan or in a casserole dish, and rub (press) the remaining salt mixture evenly onto the pork belly on ALL sides, the goal is to get the salt and Sichuan peppercorns onto the pork belly. Weigh down the pork belly with a couple of flat stones or bricks that have been wrapped in foil. Cover with plastic wrap and transfer to the refrigerator.
Day 2:
Take out your pork belly and pour off any liquid that collected in the pan. After all the liquid is drained, evenly apply the ⅓ cup of the salt mixture that you put aside the day before.
Put the stones/bricks back on, cover the pork belly with plastic wrap, and put back in the refrigerator.
Day 4:
Take the pork belly out and pour off any liquid.
Put the stones/bricks back on top of the pork, replace the plastic wrap, and put it back in the refrigerator.
Day 6:
Take out the pork belly, and rinse it under cold water to wash away all the peppercorns and visible sea salt crystals.
Pat it dry with paper towels, string it up with thick kitchen twine, and hang it in a place that’s cool and dry (and where no critters will be able to get to it) for 4-5 days until the meat is dry to the touch, but not too hard to cut. You don’t want to dry out the meat too much, or it will become tough and difficult to slice.
P.S. Feel free to marinate the pork for a couple of days longer if you like it saltier.
Day 10:
Your salted pork belly is ready!

Make sure to find fatty ground pork. You can choose a fatty piece of pork shoulder and have the butcher grind it, or use our hand-chopping method to grind your own. A 70/30 meat to fat ratio is best, but 80/20 is also acceptable. Transfer the ground pork to a large mixing bowl.
Add the minced ginger and scallions, egg, breadcrumbs, Shaoxing wine, light soy sauce, oyster sauce, white pepper, five spice powder, cornstarch, and water.
Whip everything in one direction for about 10 minutes, until the meat mixture resembles a paste. This step is very important to making sure the meatballs have the right texture and don’t fall apart during frying.
Smash the water chestnuts with the side of your cleaver or knife and finely mince them. Add to the meat mixture and continue to mix everything together for 5 more minutes. Use a rubber spatula to scrape everything together.
Heat enough oil to submerge the meatballs in a small, deep pot (a small pot requires less oil) to 350 degrees F/175 degrees C. Just be sure there’s enough oil to cook the meatballs evenly, but that the oil will not overflow during frying.
With oiled hands, divide the meat mixture into 8 to 9 equal portions and shape each into a ball. Carefully lower the meatballs one at a time into the heated oil, and fry in batches (2 minutes per batch) until they’re evenly golden brown. Remove the par-cooked meatballs with a slotted spoon and set aside.
Make the sauce & braise:
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a wok over low heat. Add the ginger and white parts of the scallions, and cook for 1 minute. Then add the sugar and cook until dissolved.
Add 1 tablespoon Shaoxing wine, 1 ½ tablespoons light soy sauce, 1/4 teaspoon dark soy sauce, 1 tablespoon oyster sauce and 1 ½ cup water. Stir and bring the liquid to a boil.
Once boiling, add the fried meatballs. Cover and cook for 12-15 minutes over medium/low heat, flipping the meatballs halfway through.
After simmering, there should be about ¾ cup liquid left. Remove the meatballs from the liquid and arrange on your serving plate. (I served these with blanched baby bok choy. Just add a teaspoon or two of vegetable oil to boiling water for that “shiny” look, and blanch for 30 seconds).
Mix your cornstarch slurry, and pour into the sauce to thicken. Once it’s thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, stir in ¼ teaspoon sesame oil and the green parts of the scallions.

It should be just smoking right before you add the bacon. Lay the bacon strips in a single layer across the wok. Don’t be shy about putting a few pieces along the sides of the wok.
Don’t move the bacon around for the first minute or so. If it’s getting too dark, turn the heat down slightly. The fat should start melting and crisping.
Next, using chopsticks or a spatula, flip the bacon when it’s partially browned but not fully cooked. Cook that side to the same level as the other. Next, grab your wok spatula and stir-fry the bacon with the heat on high to evenly crisp it to your liking. This is the method that yields a mix of crisp and chewy bits of bacon! If you like your bacon uniformly crispy, instead of using your wok spatula, flip the bacon a third time, and let it fry a little longer over lower heat.
Note that the grease pools in the wok, so when the bacon is done, push it to the sides and let gravity do the work of draining. Transfer to a plate when drained.
Next, with the heat on medium-high, lay the bread slices around the perimeter of the wok. You can use your spatula to drizzle over a bit more of the bacon drippings if you want a super crisp and decadent sandwich.

Place it skin-side down on a tray, and rub the Shaoxing wine into the meat (not the skin). Mix together the salt, sugar, five spice powder and white pepper. Thoroughly rub this spice mixture into the meat as well. Flip the meat over so it’s skin-side up.
So, to do the next step, you'll need a sharp metal skewer. Systematically poke holes ALL over the skin, which will help the skin crisp up, rather than stay smooth and leathery. The more holes there are, the better, really. Let it dry out in the fridge uncovered, for 12-24 hours.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Place a large piece of aluminum foil (heavy duty foil works best) onto a baking tray, and fold up the sides around the pork snugly, so that you’re creating a kind of box all around it, with a 1-inch high border going around the sides.

Preheat the oven to 425F. Cover the bottom of the roasting pan with sliced onions, and add one cup of water. Place the roast on top of the onions and water.
Cook the roast at 425F for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, turn the roasting pan 180 degrees, and roast for another 30 minutes. Place a sheet of aluminum foil on top of the roast with the sides exposed if the roast starts to burn.
Reduce the heat to 350 degrees and continue cooking for 3 hours, adding about ½ a cup of water every half hour, or as needed. You don’t want to let the bottom of the pan dry out and burn.
For the last half hour, turn the temperature up to 425F if the roast needs more browning.
When the last half hour has elapsed, turn off the oven and leave the roast for another half hour with the oven closed.
Let the meat rest for 10-15 minutes before cutting. Cut the roast into large chunks for a more rustic taste and feel.

Marinate with 1 tablespoon light soy sauce, ½ teaspoon salt, 1 tablespoon Shaoxing wine, and 3 tablespoons water, working the ingredients thoroughly into the pork pieces. Cover and transfer to the refrigerator.
In a medium bowl (large enough to fit all the pork), dissolve the potato starch in 1½ cups of water, and stir until completely dissolved. Set aside for 15 minutes, or until the potato starch has completely settled to the bottom.
Now prepare the sauce by mixing the sugar, vinegar, ½ teaspoon salt, and sesame oil together. Stir to dissolve, and set aside.
Take your potato starch, and slowly drain out the majority of the water, leaving behind the potato starch paste. Add the pork slices to the bowl, and use your hands to ensure the pork is completely coated in the wet potato starch. Add a tablespoon of water at a time if the mixture is too dry and hard to work with.
Prepare the oil for frying in a deep pot or wok, heating it slowly to 250 - 300 degrees F––no higher, or the pork will overcook. Carefully lower the pork pieces, one at a time, into the oil, leaving space in between, as they tend to stick together. Fry each batch for 2 minutes, transferring the fried pork to a wire rack to drain. When all of the pork has been fried once, bring the oil back up to 250 - 300 degrees F and fry the pork again in batches for about 30 seconds each batch.
Now you’re ready to put together the rest of the dish. If you fried the pork in your wok, carefully pour the hot oil into a heat-proof container, leaving about 1 tablespoon of it behind.
Heat the wok over medium heat. Cook the ginger and garlic briefly. Add the sauce mixture, turn up the heat, and cook for about 2-3 minutes. You should have about ⅓ cup of sauce in the wok after it’s reduced. Next, add the carrot, scallions, cilantro, and fried pork.

If needed, trim the skin off of the pork shoulder while you’re butterflying it, but don’t trim away the fat cap on top. We used a 4-pound piece off of a larger cut, so we also had a small bone to butterfly around.
Sprinkle evenly all over with salt (to avoid oversalting, sprinkle it from a height above the meat so it spreads evenly without needing to use a ton). Combine 1½ tablespoons ground fennel seeds, 1½ tablespoons dried thyme, 2 tablespoons dried oregano, and 1 tablespoon fresh minced rosemary leaves. Generously rub the meat all over with this seasoning. Next, stir together the 3 tablespoons of minced parsley and the minced garlic. Spread the majority on the inner parts of the butterflied pork shoulder, and distribute the rest on the top.
Rebundle the pork shoulder so it is in a relatively tight roll. Place in a roasting pan, and surround with the thinly sliced onion. Drizzle a little olive oil over the onions. Refrigerate overnight.
The next day, take your pork out of the refrigerator early (about 2 hours before you’re ready to roast) to come up to room temperature. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F, and position a rack in the lower third of the oven, and one in the upper third.
You’re going to roast the pork and the peppers simultaneously, so wash the peppers, pat them dry, and cut them all lengthwise and deseed them (If you like your long hots really hot, skip that step!) Toss in olive oil, and sprinkle with salt. Lay out evenly on a baking sheet.
Place the roast in the lower third of the oven, and the peppers on the rack in the upper third. Roast at 450 degrees F for 35 minutes. After 35 minutes, remove the peppers from the oven and set them aside. Later, you can reheat the peppers by stirring them into the hot pulled pork to rewarm them, or by putting them back in the oven in the final stretch of cooking.
Also take the pork out of the oven at this step, and add the stock, wine, tomatoes, and bay leaves. Stir to combine. Cover the pan tightly with aluminum foil. Cook for another 15 minutes at 450 degrees F, and then reduce the oven temperature to 325 degrees F. Continue roasting the pork for 2 hours.
Carefully remove the foil (you'll be putting it back on). Using a sharp carving knife, cut the roast into large chunks, laying them flat in the braising liquid. Re-cover with foil and cook for another 2 to 2 ½ hours, until the pork is fork tender.
A little while before you take your pork out of the oven, it’s time to prepare your broccoli rabe. In a skillet over medium-high heat, add ¼ cup of olive oil and 7 cloves chopped garlic. Let the garlic brown lightly, and add the crushed red pepper flakes, followed by the chopped broccoli rabe. Cook until wilted, and then lower the heat if needed to cook until tender––you don’t want the stems to be crunchy!
Remove the pork from the oven. Discard the bay leaves. Pull the pork in the pan with two forks, mixing everything in the juices.
Stir in your reserved roasted peppers to rewarm them. Alternatively, you could reheat them in the oven in the last 10-15 minutes of roasting.
To build each sandwich, grab your Italian bread/rolls, and slice them lengthwise. Lay down a healthy bed of sharp provolone slices (we went with sharp provolone from the deli counter, but if you really want to be authentic to the OG sandwich, get a wedge of super sharp provolone and cut it into rough, thick shavings), and toast to melt the cheese.

Place the ti pang in a deep pot with just enough room to hold it and eventually flip it over. Transfer the sauce from the wok to this pot. There should be enough liquid to submerge the ti pang about 75%. If not, add a little more water. Lastly, add the spice pouch.
Cover the pot, turn up the heat, and bring to a boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium low and cook the ti pang for 3 hours with the lid on (the liquid in the pot should have small bubbles). Flip the ti pang every half hour to ensure it’s cooked evenly.

Rinse it well in cold water. Cut the tentacles off using one cut, keeping about a 1/4 inch of the hood in order to end up with one piece of calamari that includes all the tentacles. If you're using larger squid, you can cut these pieces lengthwise in half in order to make them bite-sized. Having each piece be roughly the same size is important for achieving the same cooking time for each piece of calamari. Drain the squid pieces in a colander and transfer to a bowl.
Marinate the squid in the shaoxing wine and sesame oil. Toss gently and set aside.
In a medium deep pot, add enough oil so that the level of oil reaches 4 inches up the side of the pot. Heat the oil until the temperature reaches 325 degrees.
While you're waiting for the oil to heat, prepare your dry mixture. Combine the all-purpose flour, semolina flour, cornmeal, salt, and white pepper in a medium bowl. Set aside.
When the oil reaches temperature, you're ready to start dredging your squid. Work in batches of small fistfuls of calamari. Gently squeeze off any liquid and dredge the squid in the dry mixture.
Using a long-handled sieve or slotted spoon, lower the calamari into the hot oil. Gently move the calamari pieces back and forth. Let them fry until golden brown, about 2-2 1/2 minutes. Remove all the calamari and let drain on a paper-towel-lined plate. Taste one piece of calamari for saltiness (be careful, it's hot). You can sprinkle more salt immediately after frying to your taste. A necessary step, however, is to crack some fresh white pepper over the freshly fried squid. Continue frying in these small batches and seasoning with white pepper until you've fried all the squid.
Now the next phase: stir-frying the fried squid. Heat a wok over medium-high heat. Add a tablespoon of vegetable oil. Add the ginger and let it fry in the oil. After about 20 seconds, add the garlic. Stir the garlic around the wok quickly in order to prevent burning. When the garlic gets lightly golden in color, add the peppers. Continue to stir fry for another 30 seconds.
Add the squid to the wok and stir fry quickly in the aromatic mixture for about a minute or so. Plate and serve immediately with white rice!

In most restaurants, crabs are almost always deep fried first, so they are cooked quickly and the juices get sealed in. But since we're doing this at home, we don't have to get out the deep fryer. The way to do it is to sear the crabs on all sides to get the same effect. Heat the wok over high heat and add 3 tablespoons of oil. Sear the crabs, paying special attention to the open dredged areas in order to seal in the juices. Turn the heat to medium and fry until they've turned red-orange. This process should take about 5 minutes and the crab should be about 80% done. Set them aside.
There should be a tablespoon or more oil left in the wok and if not, add more until you have at least 1 ½ tablespoons. Add the ginger. Caramelize for 1-2 minutes on low heat, and then add the garlic, shallots, and the white portions of the scallion. Cook until softened.

The goal is to get pieces of fish with a lot of surface area, as they’ll shrink once cooked.
Next, marinate the fish. Add 3/4 teaspoon salt, ¼ teaspoon ground white pepper, and 1 tablespoon Shaoxing wine. Mix (best with your hand) everything well. Next, add the egg white and mix, followed by 1½ tablespoons cornstarch. Mix until the marinade starts to feel “slimy,” for lack of a better term. Finally, drizzle 1 tablespoon of oil over the top--there’s no need to mix it in, just drizzle it over the surface. Put the fish in the refrigerator, and marinate for about 20 minutes.
The active cooking time takes less than 10 minutes, so make sure the rest of the ingredients are prepped while the fish is marinating, and that you’re ready to eat right afterwards, because this dish is best served immediately.
In a wok set over high heat, add the chicken stock, water, ginger, garlic, scallions, ¼ teaspoon of white pepper, and 1 tablespoon of Shaoxing wine. Bring it to a boil. Now is a good time to add salt to taste. Next, add the bean sprouts, and bring to a boil once more. Cook for one minute. Now turn down the heat. Using a fine-meshed strainer, spider, or large slotted spoon, scoop all of the solids out of the soup and transfer to a heat proof serving bowl. It’s very important that your serving vessel be heat-proof, as you’ll be pouring very hot oil into it later.
Now, in a small pot, slowly heat up ½ - ¾ cup oil. It doesn’t have to be exact, but you should use at least a ½ cup. To test whether the oil is heated to the correct temperature, dip a wooden/bamboo chopstick into the oil and look for small bubbles forming around it, but no smoke.

For this dish, we used scallops, shrimp, and prepared frozen squid that was already cleaned and cut. You can also prepare fresh squid. Do this by cutting the cleaned squid open lengthwise and lightly scoring it with a diamond pattern. See the technique we used in our Stir Fried Squid with Pickled Vegetables.
Prepare the sauce by mixing together your hot chicken stock with the sesame oil, salt, sugar, oyster sauce, white pepper. Set aside. Separately, mix the cornstarch and water into a slurry and set aside.
Cut the ends of your choy sum, wash it them well in cold water, and set aside. These will be left whole as they are served in Chinese restaurants.
Pan-fry the noodles
Bring a large pot or wok filled with water to a boil. If using fresh noodles, blanch them for 30-60 seconds. If using dried noodles, follow the package directions for cooking times, but make sure they remain al dente. In both cases, place the noodles directly into a cold water bath to stop the cooking and drain thoroughly in a colander.
Next, heat your wok or nonstick frying pan until hot. Add a tablespoon of oil and swirl it around so it coats your cooking surface. Spread out the noodles in a thin, even layer, and fry for 3 to 5 minutes or until crispy.
Use a spatula to loosen the noodles. Take a peek under the noodles to ensure they’re golden brown. Use a spatula to flip the noodles over. If you can’t get it in one shot, flip it over in sections.
Add another tablespoon of vegetable oil around the sides of the pan, and crisp the other side to get the noodles evenly browned. Transfer the noodles to a serving plate.
Pre-cook seafood and choy sum
Bring 6 cups of water to a boil in your wok (you can also use the water you boiled the noodles in), and add a tablespoon of oil to the water. Blanch the choy sum for 30 seconds. Remove with a Chinese spider or strainer shaking off the excess water and place around the noodles.
Next, blanch the shrimp, scallops, and squid by slowly stirring them in the water until just opaque (about 20 seconds). Transfer to a plate. The seafood should be just 70% cooked, since they will be cooked again in the stir-fry step of the dish.
Assemble the dish
Start with a clean, dry wok over medium low heat. Spread 1 tablespoon of oil around the perimeter of your wok. Add the ginger and cook for 10 to 20 seconds.
Stir in the garlic, scallions, carrots and mushrooms, turning the heat up to the highest setting. Next, add the shrimp, scallops, and squid. Stir-fry for 10 seconds, and add the wine.
Next, add the sauce mixture, and bring to a simmer. Stir the cornstarch slurry to ensure it’s combined, and add ⅔ of it while stirring the contents of the wok. Cook for 15 seconds. The sauce should be thick enough to coat a spoon. Add the rest of the cornstarch slurry until the sauce is your preferred consistency.

The oysters are very delicate, so be careful handling them. Place the oysters in a colander, and let the excess water drain for at least 10 minutes.
Prepare the batter by mixing ¾ cup flour, the baking powder, white pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and salt until well-combined.
Heat the oil to 350 degrees F in a small (to save oil) but deep pot (to prevent splattering). Check the oil temperature with a candy or oil thermometer for accuracy.
Right before you’re ready to fry the oysters, add the cold seltzer––it makes for a crispier oyster. Mix until your batter is smooth (a few small lumps here and there is fine). Then, mix in the sesame oil.
After the oysters have drained, lightly pat each of them dry with a paper towel, and dredge each oyster lightly with flour. I know it’s tempting to dredge all of the oysters at once in a glob, but it’s best to dredge each oyster individually just before you batter and fry them to ensure they are fully and evenly coated.
After dredging, dip each oyster into the batter so it is fully coated. Lift them out of the batter carefully--you can use the edge of the bowl to scrape off excess batter if needed.
Now you’re ready to deep fry the oysters. Check the temperature of the oil again with your thermometer. As you are frying, you should adjust the heat to maintain a temperature between 325 degrees F and 350 degrees F, because the oil will cool quickly as you drop in the battered oysters and then quickly heat again as they cook.
Lower the oyster halfway into the oil and slowly swirl it for 2 or 3 seconds so the batter cooks slightly, and then drop it into the oil. This process prevents the oyster from sticking to the bottom of the pot. Fry the oysters in batches, depending upon the size of your pot and the amount of oil you are using. For this recipe, we fried oysters in batches of 3 or 4 depending upon their size.
Use a slotted spoon to lift the oysters out when they are golden brown and transfer them to a metal cooling rack to drain. Repeat until all the oysters have been fried.
Now you can make the dipping sauce. In a small saucepan, add the ketchup, soy sauce, rice vinegar, salt, sugar, and cornstarch slurry and heat to a simmer. You can adjust the flavor by either adding vinegar to make it more tart, adding sugar if you like it sweeter, or adding more cornstarch and water if you like it thicker.
It’s best to serve these immediately, but if you are like us on Chinese New Year, you are preparing many dishes at the same time, and it’s inevitable that these won’t get eaten immediately! So just before serving, you can reheat your oil to 375 degrees F, and drop the oysters in 3 or 4 at a time, frying them for 30 seconds or until they are crisp again. Alternatively, you can heat them in a toaster oven at 400 degrees F for 5 minutes.

Gently mix the fish and all of the marinade ingredients, spreading them out to a single layer on a baking sheet, uncovered. Let the fish marinate in the refrigerator for 4-6 hours. Overnight is best. The fish will dry out slightly, which is perfect for frying later.
For the sauce, add the water, ginger, star anise, cinnamon and bay leaves to a small pot, and bring it to a boil. Turn the heat down to low, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, remove the star anise and cinnamon. Add the brown rock sugar, Shaoxing wine, oyster sauce, light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, Chinese black vinegar, scallions, and orange juice.

If necessary, remove the lid towards the end to achieve a slightly thicker sauce, but do keep an eye on it to avoid over-reducing the sauce. Once it’s done, scoop out all the solid spices with a slotted spoon, and let the sauce cool completely. Then it’s ready to use.
Now, to fry the fish. Add 2-3 inches of canola or vegetable oil in a deep, small pot (to avoid using too much oil). Heat the oil to 375 degrees F, and fry the fish in batches of three to four pieces until they turn golden brown. Do not stir the fish around until there is a golden crust, or the delicate fish might fall part in the cooking oil. It’s also best to fry the fish once to get a golden brown color, and then fry the fish again until it’s a dark golden brown. There is no need to worry about over-frying the fish.
Next, put the sizzling fried fish directly into the prepared sauce. Ensure all of the pieces are totally coated. The golden brown crust on the fish will soak up the sauce and flavor the fish.

Even if you have it cleaned at your fish market, fish mongers always tend to miss some scales. Make sure you clean out the inside of the fish as well.
Let the fish drain in a colander and pat both sides dry with a paper towel. Transfer to a plate. Sprinkle salt on both sides of both fish--use about 1/4 teaspoon in total. Set aside for 15 minutes.
Heat your wok over medium-high heat, and spread 3 tablespoons of oil around the perimeter. Add the ginger. After about 10 seconds, turn the ginger over for another 10 seconds and push them to the side. The wok should be hot but not smoking too much (an indication that the wok is too hot). The ginger should be slightly caramelized but not burned.
Use a paper towel to pat the fish dry again, and carefully place into the wok in one motion. Do not move the fish! After about 1 minute, turn the heat down to medium; you want to get a nice light crust on the skin without it burning. Tilt the wok carefully one side at a time so the oil distributes around the perimeter of the fish, including the head and the tail. You can add more oil around the perimeter of the wok if you want some extra insurance against sticking.
Continue frying the fish for 5 to 6 minutes on the first side. At this point, a light crust should have formed, and you can give the wok a little shake now--the fish should slide around easily. If not, you can use a metal spatula to lift the fish slightly and peek underneath to check the color and to make sure the fish is not sticking. The fish should be a nice golden brown.
If the fish still sticks, then you probably have the heat too low, so turn it up slightly, add a little more oil, and let it cook for another 1 to 2 minutes! Once you have the fish sliding around in the wok or pan and the first side is golden brown, then you are ready for the flip! Carefully slide the spatula under the middle of the fish on the side towards the middle of the wok and in one steady motion, lift and flip it towards the outside of the wok. Repeat the same “flip” for the other fish.
Let the fish fry on the second side for another 4 minutes and again, add some oil if you think it is necessary. While the fish is frying, dissolve the sugar and hot water in a small bowl, and add the soy sauce, white pepper, and sesame oil (if using). Set aside.
Shake the wok to make sure the fish is not stuck. Next, add the Shaoxing wine around the perimeter of the wok and let cook off for 30 seconds. Pour the soy sauce mixture around the perimeter of the wok and turn the heat back up until the sauce is simmering (about 30 seconds). Add in the chopped scallions.

You can discard these, or trim them so that they can sit upright on the plate (if you want to keep them for presentation, which is what's done in most restaurants).
Cut off the mouth portion of the lobster head with a cleaver or chef's knife. Cut or twist off the lobster claws, and cut off the smaller legs. Set those aside.
Remove and discard the lobster gills, which are inedible. Remove the green mustard, innards and the sand tract. Rinse all the lobster pieces under cold running water. You can discard the mustard, use it in another dish, or include it in this dish. We left it out (some people don't like the strong flavor).
Split the lobster lengthwise from the head portion to the end of the tail, so you have two halves. Take each half and cut off the upper section, separating it from the tail portion (there's actually quite a bit of meat in that piece). Cut each tail half into 3 equal pieces, giving you 6 total tail meat pieces. You can adjust this according to the size of the lobster.
Separate the elbow joint from the claws and split each claw with a cleaver (using a mallet may help).
Let all of the lobster pieces drain of excess water after you rinse them and pat dry with a paper towel.
Mix the flour and cornstarch in a shallow bowl, and lightly dredge the lobster pieces. Dredge only the exposed meat to seal in the juices.
At this point, many restaurants deep fry the lobster in a large wok to quickly seal in the juices. This process only takes 20 seconds or so, but for home cooking, we'll use a smaller pot and fry in batches. This flash fry method cooks the lobster about 70% of the way through, enhances the lobster flavor, produces a rich color, and seals in the juices while preventing the tender meat from overcooking.
Heat 2 cups of oil in a small pot to about 350 degrees F, and drop the lobster into the pot a couple pieces at a time for about 10 seconds. Remove to a sheet pan to drain. The shells should turn bright red almost instantly.
To finish the dish, start with a clean wok over high heat. Add 2 tablespoons oil to the wok, along with the ginger. Let the ginger fry for about 30 seconds, until fragrant.
Add the white portions of the scallions and the lobster. Stir fry on for 20 seconds, keeping the heat cranked up as high as it'll go.
Pour the wine around the perimeter of the wok and immediately cover it. Let it cook for about 2 minutes. This step infuses or ""bakes"" the lobster with the ginger and scallion flavor.
Uncover the wok and add the soy sauce, sesame oil, sugar, white pepper, and the rest of the scallions. Stir fry for another minute. You can add a couple tablespoons of water if the wok is too dry.

When it's time to cook, bring 2 to 3 quarts of water to a rolling boil in a large covered stock pot (it should be about 3 inches of water). Rinse the lobsters thoroughly, and remove the rubber bands around the claws.
Place both lobsters in the pot, with tails curled, belly side down. The lobsters should be sitting upright in the pot when you place them, and they should not be fully submerged in water. The lobsters should be placed quickly in the pot, which should then be covered immediately. After 11 minutes, carefully remove the cover and verify that the lobsters are bright red. There should not be any dark spots on the shells; if there are, that means the lobsters aren’t yet cooked through.
Remove the lobsters from the pot with a pair for tongs, and place them into your sink. Give them a good rinse with water to help them cool down and to stop the cooking process.
Prepare a large bowl of water, which you’ll need to rinse the lobster after you extract the meat. Next, transfer the lobsters one at a time to the cutting board. Extract the meat from the lobster tail and claws (see post for more detailed instructions). Chop it up into large chunks.
Now you are ready to put together the lobster roll.
Start by heating three tablespoons of oil in a small pot using low heat. You can test the temperature by adding in a sliver of ginger, which should sizzle and bubble. Add 1 tablespoon of the finely julienned ginger and let fry slowly until golden brown, which should take about 2 to 3 minutes. Use a slotted spoon or strainer and transfer the crispy ginger to a plate lined with paper towels.
Fry 1/3 of the julienned scallion in the same way, and transfer the scallion crisps to a plate. Watch the heat closely, and turn the heat down during frying if needed so you don’t burn them.
Pour off the excess oil, leaving about 1 tablespoon in the pot, and add the remaining ginger and scallion. Stir for about 30 seconds until sizzling, and add 1 tablespoon butter and soy sauce. Once the butter is melted, remove from the heat.
Once the scallion ginger mixture is cooled completely, transfer to a bowl with the mayonnaise, rice vinegar, and half of the chives. Mix until everything is thoroughly combined. Fold in your lobster meat until everything is well coated. Add salt and pepper to taste and set aside.

Remove any scales from your fish using a serrated steak knife. The areas to look for are the belly and the edges of the fish including the top, near the dorsal fins, and the head. There is nothing worse than having to pick out scales while you’re having dinner.
Cut off any fins with kitchen shears. They are pretty tough, so be careful with this step. Leave the tail and head in tact for presentation.
Look at the cavity, and you should see the backbone. You may also see a membrane that you should pierce and cut, revealing a blood line near the bone. Run your finger or a spoon across it to clean it thoroughly.
Check the head and gills. You should not see any gills left, and if there are, remove them with the kitchen shears and rinse the area clean. Older Chinese folks who like dining on the fish head will appreciate this step.
Give the fish a final rinse, shake off the excess water (no need to pat it dry) and transfer to a heat-proof plate for steaming. No salt, seasoning, or wine should be used on the fish before steaming. Repeat. Nothing on the fresh fish before steaming!
Assembling the dish:
For steaming, I used an elongated heat-proof plate. To accommodate that, I needed to MacGyver a steaming apparatus that would fit said plate. It's simple enough. I used a wok and metal steam rack. If you need more height to keep the plate above the water in the wok, set a rack on top of a metal can with both ends removed. It’s a handy and cheap addition to your kitchen arsenal!
Steam for 9 minutes and turn off the heat. Use a butter knife to peek at the meat and confirm the fish is cooked through. The meat should be opaque down to the bone, but the bone should be slightly translucent and not fully cooked (remember, you will not be eating the bone. Trust me on this one!).
Next, carefully pour off all of the liquid accumulated on the plate from steaming and spread half of the ginger, the green portions of the scallion, and the cilantro over the fish.
Heat 2 tablespoons oil and the other half of the ginger in a saucepan until the ginger begins to sizzle. Next, add the water, salt, sugar, soy sauce, and fresh ground white pepper and heat the mixture until simmering.
Once simmering, add the rest of the oil and white portions of the scallion and stir until the liquid begins to simmer and sizzle once again.

First, use a knife to go over the fish and remove any scales that the market may have missed. Usually scales are missed along the fins, under the belly, and around the head.
You should also check the inside cavity of the fish and use a dull butter knife to remove/scrape any blood lines or membranes that were left behind. Sometimes there are also gills remaining and sharp fins, so use kitchen shears to help with cutting these sections off. Fish markets generally don’t bother with these cleaning and preparation details, but they make all the difference!
Next, start from the tail end of the fish, and cut it like you are filleting it from the tail to the front. When you reach the bones in the cavity, you can cut through them with a sturdy chef’s knife but be careful not to cut yourself! Kitchen shears could be helpful for the novice cook.
After cutting through the bones, continue splitting the fish up to the top fin as if you were filleting it, but *stop* short of cutting off the filet from the rest of the fish. Once you reach the head, split it in half, and now you have a split fish.
Give your fish a quick rinse, set it aside on a cutting board skin side up, and press on the fish slightly to flatten it out.
Prepare your silken tofu by cutting the plastic cover off, and pouring out any liquid. Next, turn the tofu container upside down on a cutting board, and carefully lift the container away from the block of tofu. Next, cut the tofu in half lengthwise, and slice it crosswise into ½-inch slices.
Use your knife or cleaver to lift each half of the cut tofu on a large heatproof plate or large bowl. The platter should be slightly deep enough to hold the steaming liquid and sauce. Lay your tofu bed down on the plate so the pieces are fanned across either side. Sprinkle ⅛ teaspoon of salt evenly over the silken tofu. Next, gently place the fish skin side-up on the tofu, and it’s ready for the steamer!
Use 4 cups of cold water in the wok, place your fish fish on a steaming rack inside, and cover the wok.
Turn the heat to medium-high. The water should boil in about 7 minutes. Steam for another 6 minutes––a total of 13 minutes. Check that the water is simmering after 7 minutes. If not, then the heat must be turned up. If you see the water boiling vigorously, then turn the heat down to a simmer/very low boil. After a total of 13 minutes, check the fish for doneness. It’s key not to overcook the fish for the best results!
Use a butter knife to press into the part of the fish that has bones underneath it. The knife should easily go through the meat like butter, right to the bone. If the meat feels a little tough or you encounter some resistance as you penetrate the fish (or you don’t hit the bone), then the meat is likely still raw and will need another few minutes.
Once your tilapia passes the doneness test, turn the heat off and carefully pour off the liquid that has pooled at the bottom of the plate, using a dry kitchen towel to grip the plate on one side, and if you need it, a spatula to gently hold the fish in place. You can do this directly in the wok, or if it’s too hot, pour it off into the kitchen sink. Either way, do it slowly and take care not to let the fish and tofu slide off the plate!
In a clean pan or wok set over low heat, add 3 tablespoons of canola oil, 1½ tablespoons minced ginger, and 6 tablespoons of duo jiao salted chilli peppers. Let the ginger and duo jiao peppers infuse the oil for about 1-2 minutes. The oil should start turning red and fragrant like chili oil!
Next, add 2 teaspoons minced garlic and the white portions of the scallion. Give it a stir for another 10 seconds, and add ⅔ cup hot water, 2 tablespoons soy sauce, and 1 teaspoon granulated white sugar, and ¼ teaspoon ground white pepper powder.
Let the liquid come to a boil, and turn it down to simmer. Season to taste with more salt––or the salty liquid from the duo jiao chili pepper jar. The sauce should be quite salty for this fish dish!
Stir in the green portion of the scallion, and take the pan off the heat. Immediately spoon the sauce onto the fish, making sure to evenly distribute the salted chili peppers, garlic, ginger, and scallions over the fish and tofu.
Sprinkle some additional ground white pepper powder over the top, and your Hunan steamed fish is ready!
Serve your Hunan Steamed Tilapia with plenty of rice, because a spoonful of fish + a big spoonful of this spectacular sauce over rice makes for the perfect bite!

Combine the rice flour, tapioca starch, wheat starch, and salt in a mixing bowl. Add the canola oil and 1 1/2 cups lukewarm water and whisk until smooth. Whisk in the boiling water. Set aside and allow the batter to rest for 45 minutes.
We used an aluminum 10” square cake pan for steaming the rice noodles. You can also use a 9-inch round cake pan and simply adjust the amount of batter per batch. The noodles should be about 1/8” thick, so the batter should just cover the bottom of the pan in an even layer. This homemade noodle may come out a little thicker than what you get with dim sum in restaurants, but you can practice making them thinner!
Use a wok or a deep skillet for the steaming, but whatever you use, it must have a lid. Fill your chosen vessel with at least 2 inches of water. The cake pan with the batter in it should be able to float on the surface of the water, and then the entire cooking vessel should be able to be covered. Bring the water to a gentle simmer.
Very generously brush the bottom and sides of the cake pan with oil. Place the oiled pan on the simmering water to warm it up. Give your batter a good stir, and then carefully pick up the pan (it’ll be hot), and pour some batter in. Swirl it around quickly so it evenly coats the bottom of the pan. For my 10” square pan, I used a 1/3 cup of batter at a time. (Make sure that you give the batter a good stir each time before using it, because the rice flour and water tends to separate a bit).
Once the pan is coated, place it on top of the simmering water, cover the pan, and steam for 3 minutes.
TO MAKE THE DIPPING SAUCE:
Add the sugar and water to a saucepan and heat until all of the sugar is fully dissolved. Add the dark soy sauce and oyster sauce and let simmer very very gently until the sauce is thin but coats the back of a spoon in a translucent layer. Set aside.
TO MAKE THE SHRIMP & SCALLION ROLLS:
When your cheung fun batter is ready, you can start making these. In a strainer, rinse the dried shrimp (if using) under running water. Soak them in warm water for 10 minutes. Drain, and roughly chop the shrimp. Set aside.
Add oil and chopped shrimp to a small pan over medium heat, and sauté for about 2 minutes. Add the salt and scallions, and stir until combined. Remove from the heat and set aside. If you’re not using the shrimp, simply sauté the scallions with oil and salt for 1 minute, and set aside.
Cook your rice noodle according to the instructions above and take the cake pan off the simmering water (if using store bought rice noodle sheets, simply lay the noodle out in a flat layer on a clean surface).
Spread 2 tablespoons of the shrimp and scallion mixture all over the surface of the noodle, and sprinkle some toasted sesame seeds over it as well. Use a rubber spatula to carefully part one side of the rice noodle from the pan, and roll it up in a tight cigar.
Remove to a cutting board and slice into 1-2 inch pieces with a sharp knife dipped in warm water. Plate and garnish with sesame seeds, scallions, and serve with your dipping sauce.
TO MAKE THE FRIED DOUGH ROLLS:
To make this Chinese fried dough rice roll, toast 2 crullers in the oven until crispy (instructions on the package. Usually a few minutes at 350 degrees F will do the trick). Split each cruller in half, since they often come with 2 stuck together.
Take your cooked rice noodles, and roll each half of a cruller in a rice noodle sheet. Cut into pieces and serve with your dipping sauce. (Note: the rice noodle I used for the cruller in these pictures was a little bit too thick, but you can adjust the thickness with practice and to your own personal preferences).",en-US,4.8,,The Woks of Life,105,6 serving(s),,,,,,,,,,,,

Transfer to a bowl, and add Shaoxing wine, salt, white pepper and canola oil. Mix until all the fish is coated. Set aside for 10 minutes before adding the cornstarch and tossing to coat. There should be no standing liquid or any visible dry cornstarch. Add a bit more cornstarch or pour off excess liquid as needed. Set aside.
In a small bowl, mix the hot chicken stock, sesame oil, salt, sugar, white pepper and oyster sauce. Set aside.
Boil enough water to blanch the vegetables in your wok. Add the carrots, asparagus, red bell pepper, and celery if using. After 15 seconds or until the water begins to simmer again, stir in the snow peas for 10 seconds, and quickly transfer the vegetables to a cool water bath. Drain thoroughly in a colander.
Velvet your fish, cooking it until it’s just shy of totally cooked through (the final cooking will take place when everything gets stir-fried together).
Option 1 - Water velveting: If you prefer to blanch your fish, wait until the water comes back to a boil, and gently place the fish chunks into the water. Bring back to a simmer. Gently scoop out the fish after about 2-3 minutes, and set aside.
Option 2 - Oil velveting or searing: Oil velveting is another word for frying the fish in hot oil—the most common restaurant technique. But searing the fish is a healthier alternative that uses a fraction of the oil. Heat the wok to high heat. Spread 2 tablespoons of canola oil around the wok. Once the oil starts to smoke, add the fish filets, and let them sear for a minute on each side. Transfer them to a plate when done. To boost your confidence for this step, see Judy’s technique for how to keep food from sticking to your wok.
Clean and dry the wok, and set it over medium heat. Add 1 tablespoon of oil and the julienned ginger. After 10 seconds, add the garlic, red onions, and scallions. Turn the heat to high, stir-frying the mixture for about 20 seconds. The wok should be sizzling and super hot.
Add the blanched vegetables, and stir fry for 30 seconds. Pour in the sauce mixture you prepared earlier. If your stove burner and wok lacks heat, pop the sauce into the microwave to heat it up for 10 seconds on high, so it doesn’t cool the wok when you add it!
Drizzle in about half of the cornstarch slurry, while stirring your vegetables. Now, gently pour the fish on top and fold the fish in with the vegetables. Add a bit more cornstarch slurry if there is still standing liquid. All the sauce should be clinging to the vegetables and fish. Make sure you cook the dish for 20 seconds after adding the cornstarch slurry to ensure that there’s no raw cornstarch flavor.
One last restaurant chef’s trick to make your dish more attractive is to add a drizzle of oil at the end to finish the dish right before you plate it. Serve immediately with steamed rice!",en-US,5.0,,The Woks of Life,45,4 serving(s),1 serving,289 kcal,11 g,27 g,15 g,9 g,113 mg,642 mg,3 g,2 g,,
1688,"Crispy Fried Flounder, Chinese-Style",Bill,https://thewoksoflife.com/crispy-fried-flounder/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/pan-fried-flounder-13.jpg,"['1-1¼ pounds whole flounder, sole or fluke ((500g))', '2 teaspoons Shaoxing wine', '¾ teaspoon salt', '½ teaspoon white pepper', '3 tablespoons cornstarch', '⅔ cup canola oil ((160ml))', '1½ tablespoons hot water', '¼ teaspoon sugar', '1½ tablespoons soy sauce', '2 teaspoons Shaoxing wine', '3 tablespoons oil from the oil you used to fry the flounder', '1 scallion ((finely julienned))', '1 small handful cilantro ((roughly chopped))']","The first step is to pat the fish dry with a paper towel on both sides. Next, rub the Shaoxing wine all over the fish on both sides. Mix together the salt and white pepper and rub it all over both sides of the flounder.
Next, lightly dredge both sides of the fish with cornstarch. I sifted the cornstarch over both sides of the fish to get a uniform, light coating. If you don’t have a sifter or fine-meshed strainer to do this, you may need to use a lot more than 3 tablespoons of cornstarch to dredge the fish. You can also try patting it all over the fish with your hands and then shaking off the excess.
Heat a carbon steel wok or very large frying pan over high heat until it just starts to smoke. Next, pour ⅔ cup canola oil around the perimeter of the wok to ensure it is fully coated and turn the heat down to medium high. Carefully place your fish in the wok.
A fish of this size will need 5 to 6 minutes on each side. You should be getting a good sizzle in the wok, and the oil should be bubbling as you cook the fish. Tilt the wok or pan so the oil reaches all parts of the fish, and soon the flounder will begin to slide around the wok with ease. At this point, you will have to use your wok spatula to hold the fish gently while you continue to tilt the wok to cook the fish evenly. Make sure that the side fins, tail, and fish head are fried evenly as well. This process takes some coordination, but it sounds harder than it is!
Note that this fried flounder recipe calls for ⅔ cup of oil, but if you double the amount, you can get better, crispier results and have a much easier time frying the flounder. However, keep in mind that all but a few tablespoons of oil will be discarded in the end.
You can check the fish by gently lifting up one side the flounder with a wok spatula (so it’s perpendicular to the fish) to see that it fried up to an even golden brown. If it’s ready, just continue the flipping motion steadily to turn it over. Flounder is large and unwieldy, so you can use two spatulas to do this. Another tip is to tilt the wok up on the side you are flipping to make things easier. If you are right handed, tilt the left side of the wok up and use your right hand to flip the fish to your left. Continue frying for another 5 minutes, tilting the wok as needed to make sure the edges fry up to a crispy finish.
Once the flounder is done on both sides, carefully scoop/slide it from the wok to a large plate. Before you do this, there’s a presentation decision--do you serve the flounder dark side (the “top” of the fish) or light side up (the “bottom” that skims the ocean floor)? Many restaurants like to serve it lighter side up, but I like to serve it dark side up. It’s the natural position of the fish, and it sits on the plate a bit better.
One you’ve plated the fish, scoop out the oil into a heatproof bowl, and wipe your wok clean with a paper towel.
Next, in a small bowl, mix the 2 teaspoons of hot water with the sugar, soy sauce and Shaoxing wine.
Use a spoon to skim out 3 tablespoons of oil from the bowl you set aside, taking care not to pick up any particles, and pour back into the wok, set over medium high heat. When the wok is just smoking, pour the sauce mixture in, stirring it until it comes to a boil, then turn off the heat.
Use the spatula to spread half of the sauce evenly over the fish, topping it off with the finely julienned scallions and chopped cilantro. Reserve the other half of the sauce for after you debone the fish. Alternatively, you can let your guests fiddle with the bones themselves, and spoon the sauce over as they like.

Take each of the crab halves and lightly dredge each large piece in a light coating of flour. Transfer to a clean plate along with the claws and shells. Sprinkle the remaining flour over the crab pieces.
Heat a wok with 4 tablespoons of oil, spreading the oil around the wok so it heats evenly. You know you have reached the right temperature when you start to see just a little (not a lot!) of smoke on the sides of the wok. Now quickly place each of the large pieces of crab in the oil and spread the claws and shells around the outside portion of the wok. Next, quickly tilt the wok around in a circle to get the oil spread around to all of the crab pieces, keeping the heat on high. After another 15 seconds of this, use a spatula and roll the pieces around the oil for another 15 seconds. Turn off the heat and remove to a plate or small sheet pan.
Clean the wok, add 2 tablespoons of oil and toss in the ginger pieces until they are just starting to caramelize (15 seconds) and then add half of the scallions – use the white pieces for this step.
Keep the heat on high and move quickly to add the crab to wok and toss the crab around with your spatula to get some good sizzle. After about 10 seconds, add the wine in a circle around the pan and immediately cover the wok and turn the heat down to medium. Let the crab cook for 2-3 minutes. During this process, it is best to hold the cover and tilt the wok so the liquid hits the hot sides of the wok and you hear and see a sizzle generating that elusive “wok hay” flavor. If you have no sizzle, the heat is too low.

Most of the time, you will find hard shell lobsters at your local store but sometimes lobsters have a softer shell just after molting and their shells are not yet fully hard. Soft shell lobsters contain more water and in my opinion, have a sweeter taste and a more tender texture but they do contain a lot of water and less meat so a good, live hard shell lobster is best for baking.
Refrigerate your lobsters in the wax bag you get from the market which will keep them alive and fresh until you are ready to process them. The cold temperature will also keep them less active so they are easier to prepare. Putting them into the freezer for a few minutes will also do the trick.
Put each lobster on its back on a cutting board, and use a sharp chef’s knife to split it in half lengthwise without actually cutting the lobster all the way in half. You can easily do this by holding the lobster down at the claws just above the head. Insert the tip of the knife where the shell is soft between the legs, and carefully cut down lengthwise to the tail of the lobster. Remember to stop cutting when you reach the hard shell so you don’t penetrate it.
After the lobsters are split, use a pair of kitchen shears to trim off the antennae and the heads. Use both hands to split and flatten the lobsters lengthwise until they lie flat.
Discard the stomach sack and intestines, which are usually transparent but filled with dark material, and the dark sand track that goes down to the tail. Use the kitchen shears to make a small cross cut in the shell (be careful not to cut the meat) about halfway up the lobster tail on each side. This will help prevent the lobster tail from curling up when it cooks in the oven.
Next, remove the green tomalley and the roe, and set aside for the stuffing if you enjoy it, or discard. Rinse out each lobster under running water until clean. Pat the shells dry, and transfer to a sheet pan.
Clean and rinse the shrimp, and toss with a pinch of salt and freshly ground black pepper. Set aside.
Mix 2 tablespoons olive oil with 1 tablespoon melted butter, and brush the entire lobster––including the outside of the shells. At this point, reserve 4 tablespoons of the clarified melted butter in a small bowl for serving (clarified butter is the melted butter without the milk solids that float to the top).
Using a fork, mix the remaining butter with 1 cup of panko/breadcrumbs, 1/2 teaspoon paprika. 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme, 1/8 teaspoon garlic powder, 1 teaspoon fresh chopped dill, if using, 1/4 cup fresh chopped flat Italian parsley (reserve 1 tablespoon of parsley for garnish), and ½ teaspoon freshly grated lemon zest.
Evenly distribute the breadcrumbs into the cavities of the split lobsters, making sure you don’t pack the stuffing. It should be loose so the stuffing has a light and flakey texture. Next, lightly press five whole shrimp on top of the stuffing in each lobster.
Drizzle 1 teaspoon of the reserved clarified butter on top of the shrimp. You can add more butter in this step if you like. Heck you can add more butter at any step if you like!
Preheat the oven to 425 F, and bake the lobsters on the upper rack for 12 to 15 minutes, or until the meat is translucent.

The taro will be slightly wet and starchy after it is julienned, which is exactly what you want for maximum adhesion. Take another steel mesh strainer of the same size and place it over the top so the taro strands are sandwiched between the two strainers.
In a wok or pot, heat 6 cups of oil to 325 degrees F (use a thermometer to check the temperature), and place the “nest,” still sandwiched between the two strainers, in the oil. Fry until golden brown, tilting the basket in different angles so the entire taro basket is fried evenly. Using a wok for frying is ideal, as you will have more room without having to use excessive amounts of oil, but a deep pot large enough for the basket will work also. Be sure to place the taro basket in the pot slowly and use the utmost caution! Using a deeper pot or wok also makes frying safer since the taro basket, when first placed into the oil, will cause the oil to expand and overflow if your pot is too small and if your oil is too close to the top of the pot.
For the seafood, make sure your shrimp and scallops are cleaned.
Prepare the squid by separating the tentacles and body and removing the hard skeleton parts. Use the tentacles as is, and set them aside to drain. Cut the mantle so you have flat pieces, and remove the inside skeleton. Cut the flat pieces into 2 by 3 inch rectangles, and score them diagonally in a criss-cross pattern, making sure not to cut the squid all the way through.
Bring 6 cups of water to a boil in your wok, and blanch the shrimp and scallops by slowly stirring them in the water until just opaque (about 20 seconds), and transfer to a plate. The shrimp and scallops should be just 70% cooked, since they will be cooked again in the stir-fry step of the dish.
Add the squid to the hot water, and blanch until they are curled, or about 10 seconds, and transfer these to a plate. Asian grocery stores sometimes stock prepared squid that is cut and blanched into curls in the freezer section; if you have access, it’s a handy shortcut!
Heat your wok over medium-high heat, and coat the perimeter of the wok with two tablespoons of oil. Heat until the oil slides easily around the wok and starts to shimmer.
Add the ginger slices to the wok, and let fry for about 10 seconds. Add the scallion and garlic, and stir-fry for another 10 seconds.
Next, add the carrots, bamboo shoots, and peppers, and turn the heat up to high. Give everything a good stir-fry for 30 seconds, and then add the straw mushrooms, snap peas, and onion.
Next, stir in the seafood, and add the Shaoxing wine. Stir-fry everything for another minute and add the hot chicken stock. It’s important to add hot or even boiling chicken stock to keep the wok up to temperature, especially since most average stoves can have trouble generating enough heat for a good stir fry in the first place. You can also add more or less chicken stock depending on how much sauce you want in the dish.
While the mixture is coming up to a boil, add the salt, sugar, white pepper, and sesame oil, and stir everything until well combined. Taste the sauce with a spoon, and add more seasonings to your preference, but be quick about it, or your seafood may overcook!
Mix together the cornstarch and water so that it’s uniformly combined, and add to the wok slowly while stirring. Again, you can add more, less, or leave it out entirely depending upon your taste preferences, but it’s best to get to a consistency so that the sauce coats all of the ingredients.

Peel the shrimp, only leaving the small segment of shell that connects to the tail. Place the shrimp on its side with its underbelly facing you. Holding the shrimp with one hand, use the tip of your knife to split the tail shell.
Next, use a steady, yet light pressure to push the knife into the shrimp, splitting it evenly down the middle until it just reaches the outer membrane. No sudden or quick cutting motions, and if you’re a beginner, you can use a cut-proof glove. At this point, you should be able to spread the shrimp out flat on the cutting board. Press the shrimp lightly into the board to flatten it out further if needed, especially on the tail shell.
Next, carefully remove the vein from the middle of the shrimp that runs along the backside. There may also be a vein along the edges of the shrimp from the underside of the shrimp as well. You can use your knife to gently scrape these veins away if you see them. There you have it! A perfectly butterflied shrimp!
Assemble the Shrimp
Next, rinse the shrimp clean under running water. Pat the shrimp dry with a kitchen towel and return to the cutting board, backside down. Season the shrimp with a light sprinkle of salt. Cut the slices of bacon to match the length of the shrimp. Gently press them onto the shrimp.
Mix 1 tablespoon soy sauce, 1 teaspoon worcestershire sauce, 2 teaspoons tomato ketchup, ¼ teaspoon white pepper, and ½ teaspoon sesame oil in a small bowl. Set aside.
Heat your wok over medium high heat; don’t let the wok get to the point where it’s smoking. Spread 2 tablespoons of oil around the wok to coat it thoroughly. Dip the shrimp into the beaten egg. Let the excess egg drip off, and place the shrimp in the wok, bacon-side down. Work quickly to place all of the shrimp. Turn up the heat as needed to make sure the egg and bacon cook through.
Cook the bacon-side of the shrimp for 60-90 seconds or until the bacon is golden brown. Carefully use your wok spatula to turn the shrimp and cook for another 30-60 seconds, flipping them in the same order you placed them. Transfer the shrimp to a plate.
Heat the wok over medium heat and add 1 tablespoon of oil. Retain all of the flavor in the wok from frying the shrimp. Add the minced garlic and onions, and turn the heat up to high. Stir-fry the onions for 30 seconds, and add the Shaoxing wine. After another 30 seconds, add the sauce mixture, and stir until the onions are coated. Add the scallions.

The shrimp should be headless with the shells on, but make sure they are not deveined with the backs cut open. In order to butterfly the shrimp, the back of the shrimp should be intact. It will hold both sides of the butterflied shrimp together. You’ll also keep the shrimp tails in place for the final dish.
Peel the shrimp, only leaving the small segment of shell that connects to the tail. If you like, you can scrape the tails to remove the liquid inside the tails, since we are deep-frying the shrimp.
Place the shrimp on its side with its underbelly facing you. Holding the shrimp with one hand, use the tip of your knife to split the tail shell.
Next, use a steady, yet light pressure to push the knife into the shrimp, splitting it evenly down the middle until it just reaches the outer membrane. Be sure to remove any sand tracts and give the shrimp a quick rinse if needed.
Pat the shrimp dry on both sides and use ¼ teaspoon of salt to lightly salt them (or salt to taste).
Making the batter:
Mix 3/4 cup all purpose flour and the rest of the dry ingredients together in a bowl. Add ice water and vegetable oil. Mix until a batter is formed, and set aside for 5 minutes.
Making the sauce:
In a small saucepan over medium heat, add 1 teaspoon oil and add the ketchup. Fry for 30 seconds on low heat until it just begins to caramelize, and stir in white vinegar, soy sauce, sesame oil, white pepper, and the cornstarch mixture.
Continue to stir the sauce until it is simmering. Once it is thick enough to coat a spoon, remove to a serving bowl and set aside.
Frying:
Heat 3-4 cups of oil in a small pot to 325 degrees F (the oil level should be about halfway up the pot).
Place ¼ cup of all-purpose flour on a small plate, and lightly dredge the shrimp, shaking off any excess. Dip the shrimp into the batter, and let any excess batter drip off. You can use your own discretion here on how much batter to use. Some like a light batter and some like it heavier.
Carefully place the shrimp into the hot oil. Let the shrimp fry on one side and after 1 minute, turn the shrimp over. Once the shrimp is golden brown on all sides, transfer to a plate lined with paper towel to drain. Serve!",en-US,5.0,,The Woks of Life,45,4 serving(s),,,,,,,,,,,,

It will take a while for the oil to heat up. The oil should be between 350-375F. You can use a spare piece of potato to check if the oil’s ready (if it sizzles right away when inserted into the oil, then you’ve got the right temperature) or use a trusty kitchen thermometer.
To make the potato wedges, prepare your potatoes. Soak them in a large bowl of water, drain, then dump them onto a kitchen towel to blot them dry. Then, in a separate bowl, combine the flour, paprika, black pepper, and salt. Add the potatoes and toss thoroughly to coat.
The potato wedges should be fried first for about 10 to 11 minutes until golden brown. Transfer to a plate lined with paper towels or a good old paper plate. If you like the wedges really crispy, you can then refry them for 1 to 2 minutes when ready to serve.
While the potatoes are cooking, whip up your tartar sauce. Combine the mayonnaise, lemon juice, chopped pickle, shallot, salt and pepper in a bowl and stir to combine. Set aside until you’re ready to eat!
To make the fish batter, mix all of the dry ingredients in a medium-sized bowl. Add the oil and beer and stir until well-combined. Next, fold in the finely-crushed white or yellow corn tortilla chips, and let the batter rest for 20 minutes.
Make sure the oil is still hot after frying the potatoes. It’s important to maintain a nice solid bed of hot coals that will take you through the cooking process from start to finish, or you can use a portable gas burner.
Make sure the fish fillets are well drained and patted dry with paper towels if necessary. Lightly dredge them with the last ¼ cup of flour. Next, grab the end of one filet and dip both sides in the batter until well coated, letting the excess drip back into the bowl.
Lower the fillet into the oil carefully, slowly swishing the lower half of the filet once or twice so the oil cooks it partially; then lower the rest in one steady motion. This ensures the batter cooks just enough so that it won't stick to the pot when you drop in the rest of the filet. The key to frying is to not be afraid of the hot oil. Dropping the fish in with a splash is dangerous, so be sure to use a slow and steady hand.
Ideally, you want the initial frying temperature to be 375F since the first batch will cool the oil immediately. The temperature will drop to 350F which is okay, but any lower than 350F, and you'll get a soggy piece of fish. Any higher, and your batter may burn. Fry the fish for a total of 4 to 5 minutes on each side, but do turn them frequently. A pretty good proxy is when the batter is golden brown and crisp.
Transfer the fried fish to a plate lined with paper towels and serve hot with the potato wedges and tartar sauce on the side. It will be the best camping meal you’ll ever have!",en-US,4.88,,The Woks of Life,35,8 serving(s),,,,,,,,,,,,

Drain, rinse in cold water, and spread the noodles out to drain further.
I recommend that you use uncooked, cleaned frozen shrimp. For this Shrimp Chow Mein recipe, I used uncooked shrimp, peeled off the shells, and left the tails on. The tails add nice flavor to the dish, but you can remove them if you prefer. I also like to butterfly the shrimp: use a sharp knife and carefully cut about two thirds of the way into the backs of each shrimp to do this. Next, toss the shrimp in 2 teaspoons of oil, 1/8 teaspoon salt, and 1 teaspoon of cornstarch. Set aside.
Rinse the mung bean sprouts in cold water. Keep them in cold water until you are ready to cook, and put them into a colander to drain just before you heat up the wok.
In a small bowl, mix the hot water and sugar until dissolved, and add the soy sauces, sesame oil, oyster sauce, 2 teaspoons Shaoxing wine, and white pepper. Set aside.
Heat your wok to medium high heat, and add 2 tablespoons of oil to coat the wok.
Spread the noodles in a thin, even layer, tilting the wok in a circular motion to distribute the oil and crisp the bottom layer of the noodles evenly. Let the noodles cook for 1 to 2 minutes, and adjust the heat as needed--lower if the noodles start to scorch or higher to lightly brown the noodles. The wok should not be smoking at this point!
Flip the noodles over, and add another tablespoon of oil around the perimeter of the wok to let the other “side” of the noodles crisp. Don’t stress if you can’t turn the noodles over in one shot, The goal here is just to get an even, light crispiness during this cooking stage. After 90 seconds, flip the noodles again and you should start to see a light browning of the noodles, with some areas where the noodles are crispier. Cook for another 2 minutes, flipping the noodles again, and transfer them to a plate.
Heat the wok to medium high, and add 1 tablespoon of oil to coat the wok. Stir-fry the mushrooms for about a minute, then push the mushrooms to the side, and turn the heat down to medium.
Add another ½ tablespoon of oil in the middle of the wok, and add the julienned ginger to the oil. Let the ginger caramelize for about 15 seconds. Next, add the shrimp and stir-fry for 15 seconds. Turn the heat up to high, and add 1 teaspoon of Shaoxing wine. Stir-fry for another 45 seconds, until the shrimp are about 80% done.
Add the noodles, and pour the soy sauce mixture over the top. Quickly stir-fry the noodles with a lifting motion until the sauce is well-incorporated--about 30-45 seconds.
Toss in the scallions and the mung bean sprouts, and stir-fry everything for another minute. The wok should be at its hottest now to help you achieve that wok hay flavor. Transfer the noodles to a serving dish (before the scallions and bean sprouts wilt--they should still be somewhat fresh and crunchy).

Using kitchen shears, trim off the legs and the sharp pointy part at the top of the head. Then devein the shrimp by using a toothpick to carefully expose and pull it out, without damaging the shell (see the photo!). Rinse the shrimp thoroughly, drain, and pat dry with a paper towel.
Heat the oil in a wok over high heat until it just starts to smoke. Carefully lower the shrimp into the oil in two batches, frying gently for about 5 - 10 seconds with each batch. The shrimp will go opaque very quickly. Immediately scoop them out into a metal strainer, to drain excess oil back into the wok. Set the shrimp aside.
Now, let the oil heat up again until it's smoking. Lower the shrimp into the oil again (in two separate batches), and fry for another 5 - 10 seconds. The frying time varies depending on shrimp size––over frying will dry out the shrimp.
Turn off the heat and scoop out the oil into a heat-proof bowl, leaving about 1 tablespoon of oil in the wok. Turn the heat on to low and add in the scallion whites and ginger. Cook for 2 minutes, until fragrant. Add the Shaoxing wine, chicken broth, sugar and vinegar. Turn up the heat, so the mixture comes to a simmer. Stir for 30 seconds.
At this point, you can choose to remove the scallions and ginger from the wok, or simply leave them in there! Finally, add the shrimp back to the wok along with the sesame oil.

Wrap the fish in fresh paper towels while you prepare the rest of the ingredients. The goal is to make the fish as dry as absolutely possible. Use a sharp knife to score both sides of the fish three times.
Once the prep work is done, unwrap the fish and dust it with a thin, even layer of cornstarch on both sides. This step will help keep the skin in tact during pan-frying.
Heat the wok until it starts to smoke, and immediately add the oil and ginger slices. Reduce the heat to medium. Once the ginger slices start to brown, remove them from the wok and set aside. Carefully lay the fish in the wok, and DO EVERYTHING IN YOUR POWER NOT TO MOVE OR TOUCH THE FISH for the next 5 minutes. You can tilt the wok around so the oil glides around to evenly brown the fish.
After 5 minutes, shake the wok slightly to see if the fish has seared enough to stop sticking to the wok. This is when you can carefully flip the fish over and do the same process for the other side.
Once both sides are nicely browned, add the ginger back to the wok along with the scallions, shaoxing wine, sugar, vinegar, dark soy sauce and light soy sauce. Keep the heat at medium low, and cook the fish by continuously spooning the cooking liquid over the fish. Cook on each side for 4-5 minutes. By now, the sauce should be cooked down and almost syrupy. Serve!
Tip: If you want to make sure the fish is done, carefully pick apart the thickest part of the fish. If the meat readily comes apart from the bone, it’s done.

(We saved the skin and seared it to a delicious crisp and proceeded to have an impromptu chef’s snack with white rice and roasted seaweed. Epic. Don’t be that person who throws away perfectly delicious salmon skin.)
Divide the salmon into 2 portions--one-third and two-thirds. For one-third of the salmon, pulse 6 times. For the other two-thirds, pulse 4 times. This ensures that the patties have a nice texture.

1721,Walnut Shrimp,Bill,https://thewoksoflife.com/walnut-shrimp/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/walnut-shrimp-8.jpg,"['30 walnut halves ((I like a lot of walnuts, and they usually disappear quickly))', '3 to 4 cups canola oil ((for frying, use the same oil for shrimp))', '2 tablespoons water', '2 tablespoon granulated sugar', '1/8 teaspoon salt', '¼ cup mayonnaise', '3 tablespoons sweetened condensed milk', '¼ teaspoon rice vinegar', '2 teaspoons honey ((optional))', '1/8 teaspoon salt', '1 pound shrimp ((450g, 16/20 size shrimp peeled and deveined))', '1/3 cup cornstarch', '8 ounces broccoli ((225g, cut into 2 inch florets))', '1 teaspoon oil', '1 teaspoon salt']","Heat enough canola oil in a small pot, so that it’s deep enough to submerge a whole shrimp. This is why the recipe calls for a range of 3 to 4 cups. When the oil reaches 325 degrees F, fry the walnuts for about 4 minutes. They are ready when they start to turn a golden brown color. Some people like their walnuts more or less toasted, so you can experiment to your own taste. The difference is really in the last 30 to 60 seconds, so make that decision quickly!
While the oil is heating, pour 2 tablespoons of water, granulated sugar and a pinch of salt into a small saucepan over low heat to make your simple syrup. Stir occasionally to reduce, 3 to 5 minutes. Once the walnuts are done, scoop them out quickly with a slotted spoon, draining as much oil off as possible. Transfer them to the saucepan with your simple syrup.
Continue stirring the walnuts in the simple syrup over medium low heat until there is no remaining liquid in the saucepan, and the syrup is completely coating the walnuts without dripping off. This step is important, because you want a thin and hard candy coating on your walnuts. If you take them out too early, they will be chewy rather than crunchy. When they are ready, transfer them to a parchment lined sheet pan, spreading them out so they are not touching each other.
Next, combine the mayonnaise, condensed milk, rice vinegar, and salt in a small bowl, and stir until smooth. Set aside. You want this sauce to be at room temperature.
Prepare the cleaned shrimp by first making the cuts on the back of the shrimp deeper, so they get a nice coating and will open up into a nice shape when fried.
Dredge the shrimp in cornstarch lightly and set aside. Keep the remaining cornstarch handy, because you will probably have to lightly dredge again just before frying.
Bring a pot of water to a boil for your broccoli, and add 1 teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon oil to the pot. Blanch the broccoli florets for 30 seconds, and immediately scoop them out. Transfer to a bowl of cold water to stop the cooking process. After 10 to 15 seconds in the water, drain into a colander. The broccoli should still be very warm, but the shock of the cold water will keep them green. Next, arrange them around the perimeter of a serving plate. Cook the broccoli just before you fry the shrimp, as the broccoli should be warm when served.
Next, bring your frying oil (the same oil you used for the walnuts) up to 350 degrees F and dredge the shrimp for a second time in the remaining cornstarch, since the shrimp may have absorbed some of the cornstarch from the first dredging. Drop the shrimp one at a time into the oil carefully, but quickly in succession. You will have to do this in several batches, depending on the size of your pot. Keep in mind, you don’t want the shrimp to stick together, and you want to move quickly to drop in each batch of shrimp at around the same time so that they cook evenly and are done at the same time.
Fry the shrimp in batches until golden brown, about 2 to 3 minutes. Gently roll them around in the oil so they fry evenly, but take care so none of the oil splashes out of the pot.
Transfer the fried shrimp to a large stainless steel mixing bowl. When all the shrimp have been fried, pour the creamy sauce mixture on top of the shrimp, and gently toss the shrimp in the sauce until coated. This process should be quick!

Toss the cleaned shrimp with 2 tablespoons water, 1/2 teaspoon sugar and 1/8 teaspoon baking soda. After the shrimp have been coated, cover and refrigerate for 2 hours.
After 2 hours, rinse the shrimp under a gentle stream of cold running water for 5 minutes to wash away the sugar and baking soda and pat thoroughly dry with a paper towel. This will greatly improve the texture of the shrimp!
Marinate the shrimp with 1/4 teaspoon sesame oil, a pinch of salt, 1/2 teaspoon cornstarch, and 1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper. Cover and return to the refrigerator while you prepare the rest of the ingredients.
To Make the Sauce:
Prepare the sauce by adding all the ingredients to a small saucepan over medium low heat. Heat the sauce until it begins to simmer, and turn off the heat. Cool completely and remove the ginger and scallion. You can store this sauce in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.
To Prepare the Rice Noodle Rolls:
Combine the rice flour, mung bean starch, wheat starch, cornstarch, and salt in a large mixing bowl. Add the water and stir for at least three minutes until dry ingredients are well dissolved. Set aside and allow time for any air bubbles to dissipate.
Soak the cotton cloth in water so it’s completely saturated. Prepare a large assembly station by brushing some oil on a clean, smooth surface like a non-porous countertop, a large flat plate, or a smooth cutting board.
Pre-boil water in your steamer with the lid on (more on how to set up a steamer here), and make sure your steamer fits the flat-bottomed pan you will use to steam the rice noodles. I used a 9 x 13 non-stick sheet pan. This recipe makes 2 full sheets of rice noodles in this sized pan (equivalent to almost 3 dim sum orders).
First, place the shrimp in a single layer on a plate, and steam them for 2 minutes. Remove them immediately and set aside.
Now lift the soaking wet cotton cloth out of the water and line the bottom of the pan with it. (Do not wring out the water.) Stir the rice-flour liquid mixture well again before adding just enough to cover the cloth at the bottom of the pan completely. Too much will make the rice noodle too thick. With the water in your steamer boiling, use the plate gripper and carefully lower the pan into the steamer, immediately cover the lid and steam on high for 2 minutes. (MAKE SURE THE PAN IS PERFECTLY LEVEL, or the noodle will be too thick on one side and too thin on the other.)
Then remove the pan from the steamer with the plate gripper and position it next to your assembly station.
Carefully lift the cloth out of the pan, and place (rice noodle side down) onto the oiled surface. Use the dough scraper and carefully scrape the rice noodle sheet off the cotton cloth onto the oiled surface. Scrape and peel off the cotton cloth at the same time. This step must happen quickly while the noodle and cotton cloth are still hot. The noodle might have a small hole here or there––don’t fret. It does not affect the overall end result.
Cut the rice noodle in half crosswise and line up four cooked shrimp along the edge of each piece. Roll the rice sheet using the plastic dough scraper to wrap up the shrimp. At this point, you’ll have two long rolls. Cut each in half, drizzle with the prepared sauce, and eat it while it’s hot.
Rinse the cotton cloth in clean water (no soap or detergent necessary) to remove rice residue before making the next one. These are best when fresh. In this case, we discourage leftovers!

After a few minutes, live mussels with their shells opened should close up. Discard any mussels whose shells remain open. Scrub any loose barnacles off each mussel shell. Transfer to another clean bowl of water.
Pull off any visible “beards” of seaweed that are attached to the mussels, using a kitchen cloth to grip the seaweed and firmly pull until they come off. After all the mussels are cleaned, toss them in a fresh bowl of water to clean any remaining loose particles. Pour them into a large colander to drain.
Repeat this procedure of soaking and draining if you see there’s sand at the bottom of the bowl. Soaking the mussels longer helps the mussels expel more sand. Once there’s no sand remaining, transfer the mussels to a colander to drain.
Prepare your sliced bread, mixing the extra virgin olive oil, salt, and a pinch of minced garlic together to spread / brush over the bread. You can prepare the garlic toast ahead of time on a sheet pan and place them under a broiler so they toast quickly.
Add 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil to a large thick-bottomed pot on medium low heat. Add 4 cloves chopped garlic, 2 sprigs fresh thyme, ½ cup chopped onions or shallots, and saute until transparent and fragrant (about 5 minutes).
Turn the heat up to high, and add the cleaned mussels, ¼ teaspoon salt and ¼ teaspoon sugar (this balances the acidity in the wine). Stir well. Add ⅓ cup dry white wine, and half of the parsley or carrot greens. Give everything a good stir with a large metal spoon, scooping from the bottom up. Cover the pot tightly. After 1 minute, give everything another stir. You should start to see some mussels opening.
Cover tightly, and let your mussels cook until the liquid boils--about 2 minutes. Give everything another stir so the mussels cook evenly. Put the cover back on and let the mussels cook for another 2 minutes. Check to see all mussels have opened and at this point, you can discard any that have not opened their shells.
Stir in the rest of your chopped parsley or carrot greens and fresh pepper to taste.

Heat 3 cups of oil in a small pot (to conserve oil) to 380 degrees F. You can use a thermometer or check the temperature by putting a drop of batter into the oil. The batter should not turn brown right away. Instead, it should rise immediately to the surface and turn a very light golden brown.
To make the batter, mix together all the dry ingredients––the flour, baking powder, cornstarch, salt, turmeric, and white pepper. When you’re ready to fry, mix in the sesame oil and cold seltzer water until the batter is smooth.
Next, drop the fish fillets into the batter. Ensure they are evenly coated, but allow the excess to drip off (if there’s too much batter on the fish, you’ll end up with dough balls!). Carefully place the fish into the oil one piece at a time, ensuring that they don’t stick to each other. Fry in batches so that the fish pieces aren’t overcrowded, frying for 3-4 minutes or until golden brown.
Scoop the fried fish out and transfer to a cooling rack placed over a baking sheet to drain. Repeat until all the fish has been fried.
Next, put two teaspoons of the frying oil in a separate wok or skillet over high heat, and toss in the onions, and peppers. Stir-fry for 30 seconds, and then stir in the ketchup.

Combine the cumin, cayenne, garlic powder, salt, black pepper, and Sichuan pepper powder, if using, and rub it all over the lamb. Set aside to marinate in the fridge while you assemble the buns.
To make the buns, start by dissolving the sugar in the hot water in a medium bowl. Once the water has cooled slightly (it should be warm, but not hot), stir in the yeast until dissolved and let stand for ten minutes. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
Once the yeast mixture is foamy, whisk in the milk and yogurt. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix it all together to form a dough. Knead until the dough comes together into a soft, slightly sticky ball (add a little more flour if necessary, but the dough should still be relatively sticky). Cover with a damp towel and let rise in a warm place for 1 hour.
Roll the dough out until it’s about an eighth of an inch thick (it will puff up quite a bit while cooking). Cut circles in the dough (about 4 inches in diameter. We just used a small rice bowl to cut out the circles). Continue to re-roll and cut more circles until all the dough is used up. Brush one side with butter and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Leave the dough circles on a floured board and cover with a damp towel.
Now heat a cast iron pan or skillet until almost smoking. Add 2 tablespoons oil and sear the lamb on all sides, until you get a nice, dark crust on the outside of the meat. Lower the heat to medium and continue cooking for another 7-12 minutes until it reaches your desired doneness. Set the meat aside on a plate to rest.
While that’s happening, make the drizzle by heating a tablespoon of oil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add the honey, vinegar, and soy sauce and allow it to bubble until it becomes syrupy. Set aside.
Now, cook your buns (this doesn’t take long at all!). Heat a pan over medium heat and brush the pan lightly with melted butter. Add the dough circles to the pan, sesame side facing up. Cook for 1-2 minutes and flip. Cook for another 1-2 minutes on the other side and take out of the pan.

Transfer to a roasting pan and roast in the oven uncovered for about 12 minutes for medium rare. Remove from the oven, cover with foil, and allow the meat to rest for another 10 minutes before serving.
To make the rice:
In a small saucepan over medium high heat, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil. Add the cumin and curry powder and fry for about 5 seconds. Then add the chickpeas along with a bit of salt. Stir everything around to warm and crisp up the chickpeas, about 2 minutes. Set aside.
Toss the sliced onion with the flour until it’s all lightly coated. Heat the vegetable oil in a small saucepan. Test the oil temperature by tossing in a piece of onion. If it sizzles vigorously, it’s ready. Fry the onions in batches until crisp, about 2 minutes. Transfer to paper towel lined plate and sprinkle with salt. In a big bowl, toss together the cooked rice, parsley, cilantro, raisins, pistachios, chickpeas, crispy onions, and salt and pepper to taste.

In the bowl of a stand mixer, add the bread flour, salt and water. Combine the mixture with your hands or a fork until it starts to form a scraggly dough. Once the dough has come together a bit, attach the bowl to the mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment, and turn it on low speed (setting “2” on a KitchenAid). Allow the mixer to knead the dough for 20 minutes. By the end, the dough will have formed a ball that: doesn’t stick to the sides of the bowl, is smooth and elastic, and isn’t too dry.
You’ll know the dough is done when you can rip off a piece of it and stretch it slowly by a couple inches without it breaking apart. If the dough breaks, knead for another 3-5 minutes (to allow the dough to absorb more moisture). If it still won’t stretch, try adding a tablespoon of water and kneading by hand to incorporate the water. Then transfer it to the mixer once again and allow the dough hook to do its work for another 5 minutes. You need to give the dough time to absorb the moisture uniformly.
If, on the other hand, your kitchen is humid and the dough is a bit sticky, sprinkle in some more flour and knead for another 3-5 minutes.
Once the dough has reached the right consistency, cover it with plastic wrap or an overturned bowl (as long as the bowl is not touching the dough) and allow it to rest for 1 to 2 hours.
Now, get the rest of your ingredients ready. Combine the sliced lamb with 1 tablespoon vegetable oil, 1 tablespoon rice wine, and 1 teaspoon cornstarch. Set aside to marinate.
In a clean, dry pan over medium heat, add the cumin seeds, coriander seeds, and white pepper. Toast the spices until fragrant, about 5 minutes. Coarsely grind the spices in a spice grinder or mortar & pestle. Set aside. Prepare all your vegetables, and set those aside as well.
Now you’re ready to make the noodles. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper, and transfer the rested dough to a clean, oiled surface. Press the dough into a half-inch thick, relatively even rectangle about 10 inches in length. Cut the rectangle into 10 equal strips. Take each strip and lay flat on the counter. Use your palm to flatten the strip into a long, wide, flat noodle––don’t worry about it being perfectly straight or even.
Now, the next step is how this noodle got its name. Pick up the noodle on both ends, lift it, and gently slap it repeatedly on the counter while stretching it out. You can also use your hands to flatten it out further so that the noodle has a relatively uniform thickness. The noodles should be about the thickness of spaghetti––if they are translucent at all, they’re too thin. Lay them onto your parchment-lined baking sheet, and repeat the process until you have all 10 noodles. If you run out of space on the parchment paper, just put another layer of parchment on top. You can keep the noodles this thick, or if you like thinner ones, you can slice each noodle in half lengthwise using a sharp knife. Cover the noodles with plastic wrap so they don’t dry out.
Bring a large pot of water to a boil. The noodles will take approximately 90 seconds to cook, so make sure you time it right so that they’re cooked and drained around the same time that your sauce is done.
To make the sauce, heat 3 tablespoons of vegetable oil in a large wok over medium heat. Add the ginger and scallion whites and cook for 1 minute. Add the garlic and chili pepper, and cook for another 30 seconds. Crank up the heat to high and add the marinated lamb. Stir-fry the lamb until just browned, and immediately add 2 tablespoons rice wine, along with your prepared spice mixture, the chili oil, sugar, vinegar, soy sauce, salt, onions, and celery (if using). If things are starting to stick to the bottom of the wok, add a ¼ cup or so of water to deglaze it.
While that’s going, throw your noodles and the cabbage into boiling water, and cook for 90 seconds to 2 minutes.
Transfer the cooked noodles and cabbage to the wok along with the garlic chives and scallion greens, and toss until everything is completely coated in the sauce.
