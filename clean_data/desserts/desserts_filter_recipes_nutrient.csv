Combine
In a large bowl, place the chopped chicken and add rice wine, onion powder, garlic powder, salt, ginger powder, and ground black pepper. Combine them well. Set aside.
Dredge
Place the corn starch in a large bowl. Dredge the seasoned chicken pieces in the corn starch and evenly coat them.
Deep Fry
In a deep saucepan (or fryer) add a generous amount of oil and heat it until the oil temperature reaches 175 C / 347 F. Start adding the chicken carefully and fry them until they cook. (It takes 4 to 5 mins depending on the size of chicken). Do not overcrowd the pan, and cook in batches if needed. (It might be useful to use a grease splatter screen if you have one as it minimises oil splatter.)
Twice Deep Fry
Take out the cooked chicken and place them onto some kitchen paper to soak up excess oil. Quickly scoop out any floating debris from the oil using a skimmer. Deep fry the chicken again when the oil temperature reaches 175 C / 347 F. Fry them until the batter is golden and crisp. (The second time frying is shorter than the first time, 2 to 3 mins.) Set aside.
Make Sauce
In a separate pan, combine all the sauce ingredients. Bring it to boil over medium low heat while stirring often. Once the sauce starts bubbling, take out the chilies and green onion pieces. In a separate bowl, combine and mix the slurry ingredients then pour it over the sauce. Stir often. Once the sauce thickens or turns to glaze (within 1 – 2 mins), remove from the heat and cool down for 5 mins.
Baste
Place the double fried chicken onto the lined baking sheet, then using a cooking brush, gently baste the chicken with the sauce. Once all the chicken is coated with the sauce, garnish with sesame seeds and green onions. Serve.
Air Fryer Method (Frying Only)
Spray cooking oil on air fryer basket.
Line Up
Place the chicken pieces, without overlapping, onto the basket. Spray some oil lightly over the chicken pieces. (While it is optional, chicken browns better with extra oil coating.)
Air Fry
Cook at 200 C / 390 F for 6 to 7 mins. Turn them over and spray oil lightly to cover the dried white spots (from corn starch). Cook for another 6 to 7 mins, or until golden brown.",en-US,5.0,,My Korean Kitchen,40,4 serving(s),549 kcal,63 g,46 g,9 g,2 g,214 mg,1601 mg,15 g,1 serving,1 g,

(A pot with a long handle is a great option as you can filter the oil easier later on.)
Add in the garlic, ginger, green onion into a wide base saucepan or sauté pan. Pour the cooking oil and bring it to boil over medium high heat until the aromatics start turning light brown or until the oil temperature reaches about 170 C / 340 F when you use an instant thermometer. Depending on your stove type, it will be between 5 to 10 mins to reach this point. Another sign you could use is by splashing a small amount (about 2 tsp) of boiled oil over the Korean chili flakes. If the temperature is high enough, the chili flakes will make some sizzling bubbles. Turn the heat off.
Scoop out the aromatic vegetables using a slotted spoon or tongs and discard. Or strain them while pouring the oil over the chili flakes (from step 1) in a few batches. It will make small sizzling bubbles initially then die down as it cools. Stir around the chili flakes and oil to mix them well. Steep the chili flakes for 15 mins and allow it to bring out the flavor and color.
Filter the oil using a funnel and filter paper and transfer the chili oil into a sterilized glass jar. (Most Koreans do not keep the residual chili flakes after steeping but if you want to you can keep them. Just skip the filtering process.) To store, refrigerate the jar. Try to use the oil within 2 months.

Combine the sauce ingredients – ketchup, soy sauce, Tonkatsu sauce, honey, water and milk in a bowl or large measuring cup. Set aside.
Preheat a frying pan and add the cooking oil and flour. Cook over medium to medium high heat until the liquid turns dark brown. It takes about 5 to 7 minutes. Stir occasionally. Reduce the heat to low.
Pour the sauce in from step 1 and stir well. Bring up the heat and cook over medium low to medium heat until the sauce thickens (about 8-10 minutes). Stir often. Set aside.
FRIED RICE
Preheat a skillet and add some cooking oil. Stir fry carrot, onion, green bell pepper and smoked ham until all ingredients are cooked.
Add the rice and the rice seasoning and mix them well for 1 to 2 minutes.
Turn the heat off. Cover with foil or a lid to keep the rice warm while getting other ingredients ready.
When ready to serve, shape the rice in a small bowl to make mounds of rice. Place the serving plate on the bowl and flip. Remove the bowl.
TORNADO OMELETTE
Beat the eggs in a bowl. To give a smooth texture, sieve through the eggs. (This is also one of the key points for success as it makes the omelette turn smoothly). Add a pinch of salt.
Preheat a non-stick frying pan over medium high heat. (It should be heated well enough for the egg to bubble up when you pour it in.) Add some cooking oil and spread it all over the pan.
Pour the beaten egg onto the pan and cook it until the edge (about 3 mm / 0.12 inch) is cooked. But an easier telltale is when the omelette starts forming air bubbles in the middle of the pan. You should look for a bit larger sized bubbles.
Hold one wooden chopstick in each hand diagonally to yourself and push the egg from the edge towards the centre while maintaining about 4 to 5 cm (1.5-2 inch) gap between each chopstick, and start twirling your chopsticks in one direction. Holding diagonal instead of parallel to yourself will give you more room to turn the egg. Swap the chopstick holding hands in between twirling to be able to keep turning and to make the tornado egg smoothly. Cook the omelette until it’s about 95% cooked. (If the omelette is fully cooked, it’s hard to keep the tornado shape as it might break in the centre.)
Hold the chopsticks with one hand and slowly slide the omelette from the pan onto the shaped rice.
Pour the demi-glace sauce (or ketchup if you didn’t make the sauce) and serve.
OVAL SHAPE OMELETTE
Beat the eggs in a bowl. To give a smooth texture, sieve through the eggs. Add a pinch of salt.
Preheat a non-stick frying pan over medium high heat. Add some cooking oil.
Reduce the heat to medium and pour the beaten egg in the pan. Quickly spread the egg and make a thin, large, and round omelette.
Once the omelette is 85% cooked, place one serving of fried rice in the middle of the omelette and spread well.
Fold around the edge of the omelette toward the rice, providing a short blanket.
Slowly slide and flip the egg from the pan onto the serving plate. Or place the serving plate on the omelette rice and flip the pan. Ensure there’s no residual oil in the pan to avoid an accidental burn.
Use cooking foil (or cooking paper) to shape the omelette into an oval shape. Watch out as the omelette rice can be hot.
Pour the demi-glace sauce (or ketchup if you didn’t make the sauce) and serve.
ROUND SHAPE OMELETTE (EASIEST)
Beat the eggs in a bowl. To give a smooth texture, sieve through the eggs. Add a pinch of salt.
Preheat a non-stick frying pan over medium high heat. Add some cooking oil.
Pour the beaten egg in the pan. Quickly spread the egg and make a thin, large, and round omelette.
Once the omelette is fully cooked, slide it out onto a small bowl. Gently tuck in the egg following the shape of the bowl.
Place the fried rice on top of the omelette (from step 4). Push it gently to shape it firm.

Put the salt pickled cherry blossoms in a small bowl and add water to cover the flowers. Let them soak for at least 30 minutes to remove the saltiness from the flowers.
To Make Milk Pudding
Cut 2 gelatin sheets into thin strips and put in a small bowl. Pour 3 Tbsp. hot water and stir until the gelatin has dissolved completely. If it’s not completely dissolved, microwave for 30 seconds and mix.
In a small saucepan, heat ⅔ cup (160 ml) milk and ⅓ cup (70 g) granulated sugar over medium heat. Stir continuously until the sugar has dissolved.
When the milk is about to boil, turn off the heat (don’t let it boil!) and add the gelatin. Mix well and set aside.
In a medium bowl, combine ½ cup (120 g) plain yogurt, ¾ cup (180 ml) heavy cream. Mix well to combine.
Slowly add the milk mixture to the yogurt mixture while you stir.
Run the mixture through a fine mesh sieve/strainer to achieve silky smooth texture.
To speed up the process for solidify the milk pudding, fill up half of a large bowl with iced water. Place the bowl with mixture in the ice bath. It will take at least 30 minutes till the mixture becomes thicker and syrupy.
Once the mixture gets thicker, pour to individual serving cups. Keep them in the refrigerator till the milk pudding sets, about 30-60 minutes.
To Make Cherry Blossom Jelly/Jello
Start this process only after your milk pudding has set. Cut 1 gelatin sheet into thin strips and put in a small bowl. Pour 1 ½ Tbsp. hot water and stir until the gelatin is dissolved completely. If it doesn’t get dissolved, microwave it for 20 seconds and mix.
In a small saucepan, heat ½ cup (120 ml) water and 2 tsp sugar over medium heat and whisk until the sugar has dissolved completely.
Gently squeeze water out of the salt pickled cherry blossoms and add them in the saucepan. Turn off the heat.
Add the gelatin and give a quick mix and then add a tiny bit of red food coloring. If you want nice light pink color, add only tiny bit. You can always add a little more if you want it to be a darker red.
Mix well so that color is evenly distributed. Place the saucepan over iced bath and let the mixture cool. This will make the mixture syrupy and thick.
To Assemble
Once the mixture is slightly thicker, pick up the stem of the blossoms and gently place it on top of the milk pudding. Pour the mixture to cover the cherry blossoms on top of milk pudding.
If you want the cherry blossoms to look bloomed, scoop the flower with the liquid mixture in a big spoon and pour onto top of the milk pudding.

Separate the cold eggs, putting the whites in a mixer bowl or other large bowl and the yolks in a small bowl.
While the chocolate is cooling, place the egg whites in a clean bowl with a pinch of salt. Working with the whisk attachment of the mixer, beat the egg whites until they are foamy and start adding half of the sugar (3oz/90g) in 2-3 separate additions.
Continue to beat on high speed until stiff peaks form and sugar is dissolved (about 5 min total). To test for stiff peaks, the peaks should stand straight up when you lift up the beaters. The whites should not slide around. Transfer the meringue into a bowl and wash the mixing bowl for next step.
In the clean mixing bowl, beat the egg yolks and the rest of sugar (3oz/90g) until creamy and stir in the heavy whipping cream.

To Make the Dough
Cut the butter into small cubes and keep them refrigerated until ready to use (I cut on parchment paper and wrap up the butter for easy transfer.).
In the food processor, combine the flour, almond meal, sugar, and salt. If you don’t have a food processor, you can simply use a bowl to mix all the ingredients.
If you want your sesame seeds to be of fine texture, add them now. If you prefer to keep the original shape of sesame seeds, add them with egg yolk later on.
Take out the butter from the refrigerator and mix together. If you use a regular bowl to mix, use a dough/pastry blender to combine the butter into the dry ingredients.
Lastly, add egg yolk.
If the food processor is small (like mine) and it doesn’t look like it’s mixed completely, take it out and mix well with a silicone spatula.
Form the dough into a ball and cut in half.
Roll it to a log approximately 2” (5 cm) across. For me, it’s easier to work when the dough is wrapped in plastic wrap. While rolling, unwrap some parts of plastic wrap then roll again. Form a nice shape. I wasn't paying attention so my log is flat on one side...
To Chill the Dough
Wrap the logs tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, at least an hour (you can put them in the freezer to speed up the process as well).
To Bake
Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). For a convection oven, reduce cooking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC). Remove the dough from plastic wrap and cut into discs about ¼ inch (6 mm) thick (if you prefer thicker cookies, cut into discs about ½ inch (1.3 cm) and you get 20 cookies total).
Place them on two baking sheets lined with parchment paper. Bake for about 15 minutes, or until lightly browned around the edges. If you are baking in batches, make sure to keep the second batch in the refrigerator to chill until baking.
Remove from the oven and allow to cool on the baking sheet for about 10 minutes. Then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.

In a large bowl, combine eggs, sugar, and honey and whisk well until the mixture becomes fluffy.
Sift flour and baking powder into the bowl and mix all together. Keep in the fridge to rest for 15 minutes.
The batter should be slightly smoother now. Stir in 1 Tbsp of water. Depends on the size of eggs and how accurate your flour measurement is, the water amount may vary but it should be 1-2 Tbsp.
Heat a large non-stick frying pan over medium-low heat (close to low). It's best to take your time and heat slowly. I keep the heat setting to the lowest for 5 minutes. Dip a paper towel in vegetable oil and coat the bottom of the pan with the oil. Then remove the oil completely (that's the key for evenly golden brown dorayaki surface). With a ladle or a small measuring cup (I use a 4 Tbsp measuring cup), pour 3 Tbsp of the batter from 3"" (8 cm) above the pan to create 3"" (8 cm) diameter pancakes.
When you see the surface of the batter starting to bubble, flip over and cook the other side. With my stovetop and frying pan, it takes 1 minute and 15-30 seconds to cook one side and 20-30 seconds on the other side). Transfer to a plate and cover up with a damp towel to prevent from drying. You do not need to oil the pan again. Continue making pancakes (you can make about 12 pancakes).

To Preheat the Oven
Preheat the convection oven (with fan) to 450ºF (230ºC). If you don’t have an oven with fan, preheat the conventional oven to 475ºF (245ºC). If your oven doesn’t get hot very well, you can preheat to the hottest oven temperature (mine is 550ºF (290ºC)) for 30-60 minutes. As for the oven rack, I used the middle rack for the convection oven (the fan circulates the air, so the middle rack is ideal). If you use the conventional oven, move the rack slightly higher as heat rises and the top of the oven is higher temperature. However, keep in mind that a 3-inch deep cake pan needs extra space for rising.
To Prepare the Cake Pan
Line a 6-inch (15-cm) round cake pan with 2 large sheets of parchment paper. When you cut 2 sheets of parchment papers, leave at least 2 inches (5 cm) of overhang around all edges. Fold the parchment paper twice to find the center of the paper.
Overlap 2 sheets of parchment paper so the cross/center matches and place them over in the middle of the pan. Make sure the longer side is against each other. Place the removable bottom on top.
Press down the removable bottom and the parchment paper, creasing against the bottom of the cake pan to fit snugly in the pan. Press the paper around the cake pan too.
Gently take out the removable bottom and the parchment-paper “mold”. Place the removable bottom back into the cake pan (as it should be). Then place the parchment-paper “mold” into the cake pan. Press the paper down to fit perfectly.
To Make the Batter
Make sure the cream cheese is at room temperature. If not, microwave the cold cream cheese at half power (50%) for 45 seconds, or microwave at 15 seconds incremental.
Press down the cream cheese and make it soft. Then add sugar.
Combine cream cheese with sugar by rubbing the mixture with the spatula against the bowl. The cream cheese will become fluffy and smooth as the sugar granules disappear.
Scrape both bowl and spatula often to ensure that nothing sticks to them and that there are no lumps.
Crack eggs in another bowl and whisk well.
Slowly and gradually add the beaten egg 3 separate times. Don’t add the egg until the batter is smooth and with no lumps.
In each addition, blend it with cream cheese COMPLETELY and THOROUGHLY.
Add the rest of the egg and blend well.
Scrap off the batter from the bowl and spatula and make sure there are no lumps in the batter. Then add lemon juice.
Sift the cake flour and cornstarch a little bit as you stir and blend together. Then sift more and continue as you finish sifting and blending in all the flour. Take your time to do this. You don’t want any lumps.
Add salt and blend together. Make sure at this stage (before adding heavy cream – more liquid) that there are no lumps.
Gradually add heavy cream while you stir. Mix until it’s all combined.
Pour the cake batter into the prepared pan in one go (avoid stop-and-go) so the air pockets don’t go in. Tap the cake pan on the countertop a few times.
With a bamboo skewer or toothpick, pop the air bubbles if there are any, and then run the batter with it to remove any bubbles. If you’re not sure if the cheesecake may overflow, bake the cheesecake on a baking sheet, just in case. Mine never did, but I use it as it’s easier to transfer the cake pan from and to the oven.
To Bake
Transfer the cake pan to the oven and bake at 450ºF (230ºC) (or 475ºF (245ºC) if conventional oven) until the top is dark amber/brown and the center is still very jiggly, about 30-35 minutes (please keep an eye on your cheesecake because every oven is different). My top doesn’t start becoming dark until a 30-minute mark, then within 5 minutes, it starts to get dark brown. If you love the “gooey/ oozy” texture and bake for a less amount of time than I provided, then you must chill before serving. NEVER overcook the cake by extending the bake time, even though the top doesn't turn dark. The texture of the filling will become curdled and you can't fix it. You probably need to adjust the oven temperature (or oven rack or preheating time) next time you make it.
To Cool
Take out the cake when the surface is dark, burnt color. The cake should wobble when you gently shake the pan. Let the cheesecake cool in the pan on a wire rack until it reaches room temperature, about 2-3 hours. Don’t put it on the countertop directly and make sure the air can go through under the cake pan. You can place it on top of the stovetop, if it's is not in use.
To Chill
You can skip chilling and serve at room temperature (which we like, too). If you prefer to serve chilled cheesecake or a firmer cheesecake, place the cheesecake, covered in cloth (don’t use plastic, as condensation may drop onto the cake), in the refrigerator for 4 hours.
To Serve
Remove the cheesecake from the cake pan and carefully peel back the parchment paper. If you have chilled the cake, let stand at room temperature for at least 30 minutes or up to 2 hours before serving.
To Store
You can store the cheesecake in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.",en-US,4.49,,Just One Cookbook,300,1 serving(s),3043 kcal,141 g,52 g,258 g,147 g,1383 mg,1901 mg,116 g,1 serving,1 g,1 g

Preheat the oven to 340ºF (170ºC). For a convection oven, reduce cooking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC). You will also need a 17cm (7"") chiffon cake pan. Make sure you use the correct chiffon cake pan. The best types are the aluminum ones with a removable base (Do not use non-stick bakeware for chiffon cake – it will not work). Do not grease the mold because the cake needs to cling on the sides and center of the pan for support as it rises or it will collapse.
Separate 3 eggs to yolks and whites. Keep the egg yolks in a medium bowl, and egg whites in a large bowl. Freeze the large bowl with egg whites for 15 minutes so that the bowl and egg whites are very cold (it's okay that they are partially frozen when you beat the egg whites). NOTE: In Japan, cream of tartar is not typically used to whip egg whites. We always use cold egg whites to make smooth, fine-texture meringue.
Crush the cardamom pods and remove the shell. Grind the seeds till fine powder. You will need ½ tsp finely ground cardamom.
Zest the oranges (I use 3-4 navel oranges). As I mentioned in the blog post, I use 2 types of zesters for more texture and flavors. Reserve some of the zest strips for cake decoration.
Cut the oranges in half and juice until you get 4 Tbsp (60 ml) of fresh orange juice.
In the bowl with egg yolks, add roughly ⅓ of granulated sugar and whisk until creamy pale yellow.
Add 3 Tbsp (40 ml) vegetable/canola oil, ½ tsp ground cardamom, and orange zest from 3-4 oranges and whisk well.
Add 4 Tbsp (60 ml) juice from oranges to the egg mixture and whisk well.
Sift 75 g (2.6 oz) cake flour and 1 tsp baking powder into the egg mixture. Whisk until incorporated and make sure there are no lumps.
Take out the bowl with egg whites from the freezer. Whip the egg whites until opaque, foamy, and bubbly.
Gradually add the rest of sugar in small increments while whisking.
Continue to whisk until stiff peaks form.
To check on stiff peaks, pull up your whisk and see if the egg whites go straight up (stiff peak) and just the tip is soft enough that it folds over, like taking a bow.
Using a whisk, whisk in ⅓ of the egg whites in the batter until the mixture is homogeneous.
Fold in another ⅓ of the egg whites into the batter. This time, fold in gently without breaking the air bubbles.
Now transfer the batter into the egg whites. Gently fold in egg whites into the batter. Make sure thoroughly mix WITHOUT breaking the air bubbles.
Pour the batter into the ungreased 17 cm (7”) chiffon cake pan in the same location to prevent more bubbles from forming.
To remove or prevent air pockets, run a skewer through the batter and then drop the pan gently on a counter holding the center tube and wall of cake pan together (so air won’t go into the bottom of the batter).
Bake at 340ºF (170ºC) for 30-35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean and the top of the cake springs back when gently pressed. If the top gets burn too quickly (maybe the heat source is too close), cover the top loosely with aluminum foil.
As soon as you take out the cake pan from the oven, drop it on the counter to shock the cake so it stops shrinking. The cake must be cooled upside down in its pan so that it stretches downward instead of collapsing. Stick the cake pan on a tall heavy bottle. If you use an angel food cake pan, invert the cake pan on a cooling rack.
To remove the cake pan, run a thin sharp knife or thin offset spatula around both the inner and outer edges of the cake.
Remove the cake from the pan and run the knife on the bottom. Move onto a serving plate or cake stand. Dust confectioners’ sugar/powder sugar on top, if you like. Enjoy!",en-US,4.48,,Just One Cookbook,60,1 serving(s),,,,,,,,,,,

Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Generously butter a 9-inch round cake pan.
Peel, halve, and core the pineapple, then cut into 3/4-inch-thick slices. Cut the slices in half. I used pineapple slicer, which cores and slices an entire pineapple.
Put 3/4 cup (150 grams) of the sugar and the water in a medium saucepan and mix well so the sugar is moistened.
Place the pan over high heat and leave it undisturbed. The liquid starts to boil slowly for the first minute or two, and then it will boil rapidly after that. DO NOT TOUCH the pan until the sugar syrup starts to caramelize from the edge of the pan like below.
When you see dark color syrup around the edge of the pan (above right), gently swirl the pan in a circular motion so the sugar caramelizes evenly. Keep swirling gently until the caramel is a medium golden brown (sorry I was busy making sure the caramel won’t be too dark and couldn’t take the picture).
When it’s medium golden brown, turn down the heat to the lowest and whisk in the 6 Tbsp. butter. Quickly mix well and be careful for splutter.
Carefully add the pineapple and stir until it is coated with the caramel. Here at this moment, I panicked. Caramel started to harden and I couldn’t “stir”! I thought I ruined the whole thing… But don't panic - the caramel will become liquid again once you heat it up and the pineapple will also release juice (see next step).
Turn up the heat to medium-high and bring to a boil. By this time you see caramel is re-liquefying already. Then turn down the heat to medium-low and simmer for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the pineapple turns golden brown.
Using a fork, transfer the pineapple to a plate.
Continue to boil the remaining caramel on medium-high heat for few minutes, or until thick and syrupy.
Arrange the pineapple in concentric circles in the prepared pan. Make sure to fill in any gaps at bottom of the pan with smaller pieces. My pineapple was just large enough to cover the bottom (so don’t eat your pineapple until you finish this step!). If you have extra pineapple, you can do double layers. Then pour the caramel syrup on top.
In a medium bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt.
In a large bowl, beat together the eggs and egg yolks until blended, then slowly beat in the remaining 1 cup (200 grams) sugar, the vanilla, and the 1/2 cup melted butter. Using a rubber spatula, fold the flour mixture into the egg mixture until it's completely mixed.
Pour the batter evenly over the pineapple in the cake pan. Tap the pan gently on a counter top to get rid of any air bubbles in the batter.
Bake for 50 to 60 minutes, or until the top is golden brown. If it becomes golden brown too quickly and not done baking yet, cover with aluminum foil so it doesn't burn. The cake is ready when you insert a skewer in the center of the cake and it comes out clean (batter free). Let cool in the pan on a wire rack for about 30 minutes.
Place a serving plate upside down on top of the cake pan, then holding the pan and the plate tightly together, invert them quickly (but carefully). Lift off the cake pan. If some of the pineapple are stuck to the pan, remove them and place them back on top of the cake. Let the cake cool for at least another 30 minutes, then serve warm or at room temperature.

You will need two madeleine pans.
Melt the unsalted butter in a small saucepan over medium low heat. Be careful not to burn the butter. Once melted completely, transfer to a small bowl and let it cool.
In a large bowl, add ⅔ cup (133 g) sugar. Then sift 1 cup (120 g) all-purpose flour, ¼ tsp salt, 1 tsp baking powder, and 1 Tbsp (6 g) matcha (green tea powder).
Whisk all together to combine.
In a medium bowl, whisk together 2 eggs and 1 Tbsp milk till frothy.
Add the egg mixture into the flour mixture. Using a rubber spatula, stir until just combined.
Slowly add half of the cooled melted butter. Make sure to blend the butter and mixture well before you add more butter. Mix until just blended and do not over mix.
Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate to rest the batter for 3 hours, or if you have the time, overnight (highly recommended). If you don't bake it soon, put the batter in an airtight bag and store it in the freezer for up to 2 weeks.
Center a rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). For a convection oven, reduce cooking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC).
Melt the 1 Tbsp butter in the microwave. Using a pastry brush, brush butter in the molds of two 12 full-size shell-shaped madeleine pans. Then using a fine-mesh strainer, lightly dust 1 Tbsp flour over the molds.
Remove the batter from the refrigerator and fill each mold in the madeleine pan with 1 Tbsp. of the batter. I scoop the batter with a 1-tablespoon measuring spoon and transfer the batter into each mold with a mini rubber spatula. No need to smooth out the batter in the mold as it’ll melt in the oven.
Bake at 375°F (190°C) for 11-13 minutes, or until the madeleines’ edges looks done and the tops spring back when touched.
Remove the pan from the oven and let cool for 3 minutes. Using a fork, gently release the madeleines from the molds and transfer them onto a cooling rack.

The madeleines are ready to serve when they are slightly warm or at room temperature. Dust the tops with confectioner’s sugar if desired. If you are storing/freezing the madeleines, do not dust with sugar until you are ready to serve.
To Store
Madeleines get dry rather fast and are best eaten within a few hours after they came out of the oven. To store them longer, let the madeleines cool COMPLETELY. Then you can freeze them (they'll keep for 2 months) or place them in a Ziplock bag (and enjoy within 48 hours).

For the other 4 yuzu, cut off the top ¼ of the yuzu to make a cup and lid.
Squeeze juice out of all the yuzu (4 yuzu cups from Step 3 and 2 yuzu from Step 2). Strain the juice into the small bowl, making sure to separate the seeds. You should have about ¼ cup of juice and zest.
Hollow out 4 yuzu cup with a spoon. Be careful not to tear the yuzu cups when you are removing the seeds and flesh.
Add the yuzu zest and yuzu juice into the simple syrup and combine well. Transfer the mixture into a bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let the mixture cool in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes.

To Make Shiratama Dango
For shiratama dango, put ¼ cup (34 g) shiratamako and ¼ tsp sugar in a bowl and stir in 2 Tbps warm water a little bit a time until the dough is combined and smooth. Take the dough out of the bowl and roll into a ball. The texture of the dough is like squeezing an ""ear lobe"" (that’s how we describe this particular tenderness in Japanese).
Divide the dough into 6 pieces.
Roll each piece into a ball and then press the center to flatten. With the center flattened, it helps shiratama dango cook faster. Continue with the rest of pieces.
Cook the shiratama dango in boiling water. When shiratama dango is cooked through, about 1-2 minutes, they’ll starts to float. Pick them up and soak in ice water to cool.

Cut the vanilla bean in half (we only use ½). Make a slit lengthwise on the vanilla bean and scrape off the vanilla bean with a knife.
In a medium saucepan (preferably a heavy saucepan for equal heat distribution), combine the milk and vanilla bean and bring it to ALMOST boil (small bubbles around the edges). Remove from the heat and set aside.
In a medium mixing bowl, add egg yolks and beat gently. Add granulated sugar and whisk until the mixture turns pale yellow.
Add the cake flour and whisk until combine.
Pour small amount of the hot milk mixture to the egg mixture and quickly whisk to combine. Slowly add the rest of milk while whisking.
Set a fine-mesh strainer over the saucepan and pour everything back into the saucepan. Cook the mixture over medium heat while CONSTANTLY mixing with a silicone spatula. It starts as a thin and frothy mixture and it will start to thicken. It’ll take 20-25 minutes for the custard cream to thicken.
Stir constantly, making sure to scrape off the custard on the entire bottom and the corners of the pan. Ensure that the mixture heats evenly. Lift the spatula up occasionally to check if any large bubbles are bursting at the top of the mixture. Keep cooking and stirring until large bubbles appear. Then boil and stir for 1 minute. The custard should be shiny and drops intermittently when you lift up the silicone spatula. Add the butter to combine, if you are using it. Remove the saucepan from the heat.
Transfer the custard to a tray (or flat container) and cover with plastic wrap to prevent a film from forming on top of the custard. Put the tray over ice cubes and put the ice pack on top of the custard to cool immediately, about 30 minutes. The key is to cool quickly so the custard won’t get spoiled.
When it’s cool, put the custard back into a bowl and whisk until nice and smooth. The custard is now ready to use.
To Store
You can keep the homemade custard for up to 2-3 days in the refrigerator. To prevent a film from forming on top of the custard as it cools, put and press down a piece of plastic wrap on top of the custard.

For a convection oven, reduce cooking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC). You will also need an 8” (20 cm) chiffon cake pan. If you have a different size pan, please read this post to adjust the ingredients.
In a bowl, combine cake flour (80 g, ⅔ cup), baking powder (5 g, 1 ¼ tsp), and Dutch-processed cocoa powder (40 g, ½ cup) and mix well with a fork/whisk.
Separate 5 large eggs to yolks and whites. Keep the egg whites in a stand mixer bowl and egg yolks in a large mixing bowl.
Refrigerate (or freeze) the bowl with egg whites for 15 minutes so both bowls and egg whites are cold (it’s okay if the egg whites are partially frozen). In Japan, we chill the egg whites to make smooth, fine-textured meringue and do not use cream of tartar.
Beat the egg yolks.
Add granulated sugar (65 g, ⅓ cup). Whisk vigorously until it’s a creamy pale yellow color.
Add the oil (60 ml, ¼ cup) and beat to combine with the whisk.
Add the milk (90 ml, ⅓ cup +1 ½ Tbsp) and vanilla (5 ml, 1 tsp) and combine well.
Using a fine-mesh sieve, sift half of the dry ingredients. Whisk well to combine.
Add the rest of the dry ingredients and mix well until just combined and no lumps (do not overmix).
Take out the bowl of egg whites and set your stand mixer with a whisk attachment.
Start whipping the egg whites on medium speed (level 5) until the egg whites are bubbly, opaque, and foamy.
Gradually add granulated sugar (65 g, ⅓ cup) in small increments while whisking. Once you add all the sugar, change to a higher speed (level 8) and beat vigorously until stiff peaks form.
To check on stiff peaks, pull up your whisk and see if the egg whites go straight up and just the tip is soft enough that it folds over, like taking a bow. This is a stiff peak stage. By this time, the meringue should have a glossy texture. TIP: I usually pause beating when the egg whites are getting close to the stiff peak stage. Take out the whisk attachment from the mixer and hand-mix the egg whites till homogenous in texture. Typically, the egg whites near the edge of the bowl are looser (not close to stiff peaks) compared to the center of the bowl. Then put the whisk back and continue beating till stiff peaks.
Using a whisk, take ¼ of the meringue from the bowl and add to the batter. Whisk well to combine until homogenous.
Take a third (⅓) of the meringue left in the bowl and this time, gently fold in without deflating the air bubbles in the meringue and batter.
Take another third and repeat the process.
Take the final third and gently fold in. Make sure to thoroughly mix without deflating the air bubbles.
The consistency should look like this when you lift the whisk. Switch to the spatula and fold in one last time, scraping from the side and bottom of the bowl, making sure there is no chocolate accumulation.
From 6-8 inch high, pour the batter into the ungreased 20-cm (8-inch) chiffon cake pan at the same location to prevent more bubbles from forming. Gently tap the cake pan on the working surface to release the air pockets in the batter.
Run a wooden skewer through the batter to release air pockets. Put the cake pan in the middle rack of the oven and bake at 340ºF (170ºC) for 35-40 minutes (40 minutes for my oven).
When it’s done baking, insert the wooden skewer in the middle of the cake to see if it comes out clean (If wet, bake longer) and the top of the cake springs back when gently pressed. If the top gets burn too quickly (maybe heat source is too close), cover the top loosely with aluminum foil.
Remove the cake pan from the oven and gently drop the pan onto the working surface to shock the cake so it stops shrinking.
Prepare a bottle with a long neck and invert the cake pan to let cool completely in its cake pan so that it stretches downward.
Once the cake is completely cool, run offset spatulas around both inner and outer edges of the cake (I use a large/long spatula for outside and bottom and a small spatula for around the inner tube). I used to use a knife, but the tip of the knife tends to poke the cake while moving around, so I stopped using it.
Gently remove the cake from the pan and run the offset spatula on the bottom of the cake.
Invert the cake onto a plate or cake stand. Chiffon cake is served “upside-down”, the flat bottom side being on top.
To Serve and Store
Dust with powdered sugar and decorate with raspberries and mint leaves if you like. I strongly recommend consuming the cake soon, however, you can keep the cake at room temperature (cooler place) in a cake stand with a cover for 1-2 days.

To Make the Custard
In a large bowl, whisk together 10 eggs and ⅓ cup sugar. Tip: Make sure to beat the eggs well and let the sugar dissolve at this point; it gets harder to mix when more liquid is added.

Add 1 tsp cinnamon, ½ tsp ground clove, and ¼ tsp kosher salt.
Lastly, add 1 tsp orange zest and whisk all together. Set aside.
To Prepare the Bread Pudding
Cut the Panettone into 1 inch (2.5 cm) slices.
Cut the slices into 1 inch (2.5 cm) cubes.
Grease a 9 x 13 casserole dish with butter and place cubed bread in the casserole.

Beat the eggs and sugar on high speed (Speed 10) for 5 minutes (See Notes). The volume of the beaten eggs will increase about 4 times. The texture will be thick and the color will be pale yellow. When you stop the mixer and lift the whisk attachment, the mixture should fall in ribbons.
Add the honey mixture into the egg mixture and whisk on low speed (Speed 2) until combined, about 30 seconds.
Add the bread flour at three separate times: add ⅓ of the bread flour and whisk on low speed (Speed 2) for 15 seconds, then add more flour and whisk for 15 seconds. Add the last remaining portion and whisk until just combined for about 1 minute. Do not overmix.
Spray the loaf pans with oil and spread out evenly with pastry brush.
Put the parchment paper in the pans and make sure the paper sticks to the pans. If not, add oil and spread out evenly with a brush.
Pour the batter into the pans (about 80% full).
Using a skewer, draw a zigzag line to remove the air bubbles in the batter.
Level batter in each pan by holding pan 2-inches above counter dropping it flat onto counter. Do this several times to release air bubbles.
Bake at 320ºF (160ºC) in the middle rack of the oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or until golden brown and a skewer inserted in the center comes out clean (See Notes). I bake for 35 minutes and keep my oven door ajar for a few minutes then I take out the cake. When done, cake sides will pull away from the pan slightly; the top will be flat and feel spongy when pressed with a finger.
Mix 1 Tbsp honey and ½ Tbsp warm water in a bowl and apply the honey mixture on top of the cake with a pastry brush.
Place a sheet of plastic wrap on the counter top. Take out the cake from the pan to the plastic wrap, top facing down. Gently peel off parchment paper.
Immediately wrap the cake with plastic wrap to keep the moisture and while it's hot store in the refrigerator overnight (at least 12 hours), keeping the top side facing down. This will help the cake have more fine and moist texture.
To serve, slice off the sides of the cake with a sharp bread knife and cut into ¾ to 1 inch thick slices (you get 7-8 slices total). It's better if you bring the cake to room temperature before serving.
To Store
To save for later, wrap individual pieces with plastic wrap. You can store at room temperature for up to 3-4 days, 5-7 days in the refrigerator, and 1 month in the freezer.",en-US,4.5,,Just One Cookbook,60,2 serving(s),,,,,,,,,,,
50,Chocolate Chip Cookies with Nutella,Namiko Chen,https://www.justonecookbook.com/chocolate-chip-cookies-with-nutella-recipe/,Japanese,https://www.justonecookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Chocolate-Chip-Cookies-with-Nutella.jpg,"['½ cup Nutella ((chocolate hazelnut spread, see Notes))', '1 cup unsalted butter ((16 Tbsp))', '2¼ cups all-purpose flour (plain flour)', '1¼ tsp baking soda', '½ tsp coarse sea salt ((plus more for sprinkling))', '1 cup light brown sugar', '½ cup sugar', '1 large egg (50 g w/o shell)', '1 large egg yolk', '2½ tsp pure vanilla extract', '1 Tbsp plain yogurt ((I used Greek yogurt))', '½ cup semisweet chocolate chips', '½ cup dark chocolate chips']","Gather all the ingredients.
Line a baking sheet/pan with parchment paper. Place Nutella in a plastic bag (I used a Ziploc bag) toward one corner of the bag (or use this method* - See Note). Twist so that it does not squeeze out of the top. Cut one corner off the end of the bag.
Pipe small dollops of Nutella onto the parchment paper, about 1-1 ½ tsp. each. You will need about 2 dozen and make some extra just in case. Transfer the baking sheet to the freezer and let sit until firm, about 2 hours.
Cut the butter into a few pieces and place in a large skillet or a saucepan over medium heat. Melt the butter completely stirring frequently with the spatula. As the butter heats, it will begin to foam and then bubble. After several minutes, the milk solids will start to become brown on the bottom of the pan (sorry no pics after this - I was a bit pre-occupied). Make sure that milk solids do not stick to the pan. Continue stirring until the butter is evenly browned, being careful not to burn. Remove from the heat and let cool for a few minutes (see the video in the post).
In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda and salt.
In the bowl of an electric mixer, combine the sugars and the brown butter. Mix on medium speed until well blended and smooth.
Blend in the egg and egg yolk, vanilla and Greek yogurt, scraping down the bowl as needed.
With the mixer on low speed, blend in the dry ingredients just until incorporated.
Fold in the chocolate chips. Chill the dough briefly, about 30 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 350F (175C) and line baking sheets with parchment paper. We will work in 2-3 batches as the Nutella dollops soften quickly when they are outside of the freezer.
Use a tablespoon, scoop a portion of cookie dough twice and roll into a ball. Place the cookie dough rolls on the prepared baking sheets, 2-3 inches apart. Put the remaining cookie dough in the refrigerator.
Take out the frozen Nutella dollops from freezer. Press an indentation into the center of the dough ball to create a bowl shape. Place a dollop of the frozen Nutella in the indentation and pinch together the edges of the cookie dough over the top to completely seal it in the center.
Make a couple of pinches on the top part of the dough so that the finished product will look more appealing. Place the cookies on the prepared baking sheets, 2-3 inches apart. By this time Nutella dollops are too soft to pick up with your hand so put them back in freezer.
Bake until the cookies are golden brown about 14 minutes, rotating the baking sheet halfway through. After you rotate the baking sheet, start working on the next batch with remaining dough as needed.
When the cookies are finished baking, sprinkle lightly with additional sea salt. Let sit a few minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool. Once they are completely cool, store them in an airtight container.
You can rewarm the cookie(s) in microwave for a few seconds before you eat.
If you don’t want to bake the whole cookie dough, shape the dough balls and flash freeze on a baking sheet. Then put in a freezer bag and store in freezer up to 3 months. When you bake in the future, thaw the cookies while preheating the oven and bake them about 2 minutes longer than the original recipe says.",en-US,5.0,,Just One Cookbook,194,2 serving(s),,,,,,,,,,,

Preheat oven to 400ºF (200ºC). For a convection oven, reduce cooking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC). Place 1 sheet of pastry on a baking sheet that has been lined with parchment paper. Put another pastry sheet on a different sheet of parchment paper. Defrost for 10 minutes at room temperature.
Cut the pastry sheets in half with a scissor. Now you have 4 rectangular sheets. Then make several slits on 2 sheets that will go on top of the pie.
Peel the sweet potato and cut it in half lengthwise. Then cut into smaller chunks so they will cook faster.
In a pot, put sweet potato and cover it with water. Bring it to a boil and cook until a skewer goes through the potatoes smoothly, about 12-15 minutes. Drain water completely and transfer to a large bowl.
Use a potato masher or fork to mash the sweet potato. Add sugar and butter and keep mixing.
Add egg yolk and heavy whipping cream and mix well.
Now you put the sweet potato mixture on the bottom sheets. Keep about half inch space around the rim. Then cover with the top sheet.
Use a fork to pinch the edges.
Beat the egg in a small bowl and brush the top of the pastry so it will turn nice golden brown. Sprinkle black sesame seeds on top.
Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until golden brown. Let cool a bit and ready to serve in 10 minutes.

Please note that there will be 30 minute soaking time as well as 1 hour chilling time. You will need a madeline pan.
Put the salt pickled cherry blossoms in a small bowl and add water. Discard the water and salt that accumulates on the bottom of the bowl.
Add water again and let them soak for 30 minutes to remove the saltiness from the flowers.
Pick up the flowers and let them dry on a sheet of paper towel. Set 12 of the best-looking flowers aside. Keep a separate pile of the remaining flowers and broken pieces.
Finely chop the remaining flowers and broken pieces (I had about 1 tsp chopped flowers).
Melt the unsalted butter in the microwave (or in a small saucepan over medium low heat).
In a medium bowl, combine 1 egg and ⅓ cup sugar, and whisk together till frothy.
Using a fine-mesh sieve, sift ½ cup all-purpose flour and ½ tsp baking powder over the egg mixture. Using a silicone spatula, fold in until just combined.
Add ½ Tbsp milk and blend together with the batter.
Slowly add half of the cooled melted butter. Make sure to blend the butter and mixture well before you add the rest of butter. Mix until just blended and do not overmix.
Add the chopped flowers and fold in gently.
Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate. Rest the batter for at least one hour, or preferably overnight. If you do not plan on making it soon, put the batter in an airtight bag, and store in the freezer for up to 2 weeks.
Center a rack in the oven and preheat to 375°F (190°C). For a convection oven, reduce cooking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC). Melt 1 Tbsp butter in the microwave. Using a pastry brush, brush butter into the molds of a 12 shell-shaped madeleine pan. Then using a fine-mesh strainer, lightly dust ½ Tbsp all-purpose flour over the molds.
Carefully place each flower into the mold.
Remove the batter from the refrigerator and scoop the batter with a 1-Tbsp measuring spoon. Transfer to each mold with a mini silicone spatula. No need to smooth out the batter in the mold as it will melt in the oven.
Bake at 375°F (190°C) for 11-13 minutes, or until the madeleines’ edges look done and the tops spring back when touched. Remove the pan from the oven and let cool for 3 minutes.
Using a fork, gently release the madeleines from the molds and transfer them onto a cooling rack. The madeleines are ready to serve when they are slightly warm or at room temperature. Dust the tops with confectioner’s sugar if desired (skip if you’re storing/freezing).

Rinse oak leaves in running water. If the oak leaves you purchased are the dried kind, boil for 10 minutes and then soak in water. Dry with paper towel.
Wet your hands with water and scoop 1 heaping spoon of red bean paste (25 g) onto your hand. Shape it into a ball. Repeat until you have 10 balls.
In a large bowl combine 7 oz (200 g) Joshinko, 2 Tbsp potato starch, and 2 Tbsp sugar and mix all together with a whisk.
Add 260 ml (1 cup + 4 tsp) water and mix well with the whisk.
Loosely cover with plastic wrap and microwave for 4 minutes (1100 watt microwave). Please adjust the cook time according to your microwave’s power.
Loosen the mochi with spatula. Soak the wooden pestle (or anything that you can pound with) in water and start pounding.
Mochi will get sticker and shinier by pounding. Make sure to soak the pestle in water between poundings. It will help mochi become shiny and glossy.
Once mochi is cool enough for you to handle, transfer the mochi on moist working surface. Start kneading with your wet hands until glossy, elastic, and smooth.
Cut the mochi in half then cut into 5 pieces.
Shape each piece into a round ball then cover the mochi under a damp towel to prevent from drying. With a rolling pin, roll mochi ball into an oval shape.
Place a red bean paste ball in the center of the mochi and fold in half to seal the edge. Make sure your fingers are clean. If your finger has red bean paste on it or if the red bean paste overfills out of the seam line, the sides won’t stick each other and it’ll become very hard to seal. What I do is pull mochi away from red bean paste and seal tightly first, then reshape the mochi to make them look nice.
Wrap mochi in an oak leaf. The back side of the leaf (veins are more visible) should be faceing outside for red bean filling (Read the post for more details).

Gather all the ingredients first.
Cut the unsalted butter into smaller pieces (so that they will soften faster). It’s important to soften (not melt) the butter before we start.
In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or in a large bowl with a hand mixer, beat the butter until smooth and creamy.
Add the powder sugar and blend until soft and light. Scrape down the bowl as needed.
Sift the cake flour and almond meal into the bowl.
Add zest from 3 Meyer lemons. Make sure you just zest the yellow skin, not pith (white bitter part).
Add the milk and mix all together with the silicone spatula.
At the beginning, the dough is crumbly, but it will come together into a ball.
Because the dough will be still too soft to roll into a log shape, take out the dough from the bowl and wrap with plastic wrap. Keep in the refrigerator for 1 hour.
Take out the dough from the refrigerator and unwrap. Shape the dough into a cylinder, about 1.5 inches (4 cm) diameter.
Wrap in plastic wrap and chill in refrigerator until firm, at least 2 hours. Optional: you can place the dough on a bed of rice while chilling. It helps the dough in nice cylindrical shape, so your cookie slices won’t be flat on one side.
To Bake Cookies
Preheat the oven to 375ºF (190ºC). For a convection oven, reduce cooking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC). Line the baking sheet with parchment paper or silicone baking liner.
Take out the cookie log (dough) from the refrigerator and remove the plastic wrap. In a tray that fits the cookie dough, sprinkle the white sparkling sugar. Roll the cookie log on the sparkling sugar until the log is covered with sugar.
The sugar should stick without any issue, but you could wrap the dough with a damp paper towel so that the dough will be slightly wet or brush egg wash on the dough (traditional method).
With a sharp knife, slice the dough into 1/3 inches (7 mm)-thick rounds. Place them on the baking sheet, leaving about 1” (2.5 cm) between rounds.
Lower the oven temperature to 350ºF (180ºC) and bake the cookies for about 25 minutes, or until the edge of the cookies start to get golden brown.
Remove from the oven and let cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes; then carefully transfer to a cooling rack and let cool completely.
To Store
If you pack the cookies in an airtight container, they will keep for at least 4 days. You can also freeze the unbaked log of dough, wrapped in plastic wrap, for up to 2 months.

With a sharp knife, chop the chocolate into smaller pieces so that they will melt faster and more evenly.
Line an 8"" x 8"" (20 x 20 cm) baking dish with parchment paper. Choosing the right size tray is important for the height of chocolate (If you use a bigger tray, the chocolate will be flatter).
Add the heavy cream into a small saucepan and bring it to ALMOST boil over medium heat. Whisk to evenly distribute heat and keep an eye on the cream.
When you see small bubbles around the saucepan, remove from the heat.
Add the chocolate into the heavy cream and stir to combine with a silicone spatula.
Mix the chocolate and cream and make sure there is no lump. The chocolate should be completely smooth.
If you like, add liqueur of your choice.
Pour the mixture into the prepared baking dish and smooth the surface with the silicone spatula.
Tap the baking dish onto the counter a few times (to make sure the chocolate is evenly distributed). Refrigerate until firm, about 4-5 hours.
After Chilling 4-5 Hours...
Remove the chocolate from the baking dish.
Cut the excess chocolate around the edges to have nice sharp corners.
Warm up the sharp knife with a hot towel, and cut the chocolate into 1” strips. Make sure to clean/warm the knife before each cut to achieve a nice sharp cut.
Depending on your baking dish, the 4 sides of the chocolate may not look good (mine has curved edges and corners). If that's the case, save these chocolate pieces for yourself to enjoy.
Then cut the strips into cubes. Remember to clean/warm up the knife before each cut.
Sprinkle the cocoa powder on the top. Optionally, if you prefer all sides to have cocoa powder, you can dip in cocoa powder to coat all sides.
To Serve
Serve Nama Chocolate on a plate, or put it in a box as a gift. If the chocolate just came out of the refrigerator, I recommend waiting for 5-10 minutes before serving so it's soft enough to melt in the mouth instead of chilled and hard chocolate.

Cut the unsalted butter into smaller pieces (so that they will soften faster). It’s important to soften the butter before we start.
Separate salt pickled cherry blossoms into 2 groups: good flowers for decoration on the cookies, and 1 Tbsp of damaged flowers for blending in the cookie dough.
To remove saltiness, soak each group of flowers in water (separately) for at least 30 minutes.
Squeeze water out from 1 Tbsp of damaged flowers and pat dry with a paper towel.
Then mince the flowers and set aside.
Pick up the good flowers from the water, shape the petals nicely, and place the each flower on paper towel. Cover with another sheet of paper towel and gently pat dry. Set aside.
Sift the cake flour and add the salt in the same bowl.
In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or in a large bowl with a hand mixer, beat the butter until smooth and creamy.
Add the ½ cup (60 g) powdered sugar and blend until soft and light. Scrape down the bowl as needed.
Add the egg yolk and mix well until combined.
Gradually add 1 cup cake flour (120 g) and blend until the dough is smooth.
Add minced cherry blossoms and blend well.
Because the dough will be still too soft to roll into a log shape, cover the bowl with plastic wrap (or take out the dough from the bowl and wrap with plastic wrap) and keep in the fridge for 1 hour.
Shape the dough into a cylinder, about 1.5 inches (4 cm) diameter.
Wrap in plastic wrap and chill in refrigerator until firm, at least 2 hours. Optional; you can place the dough on a bed of rice while chilling. It’ll help keep the dough in nice cylindrical shape, so your cookie slices won’t be flat on one side.
Preheat the oven to 350ºF (175ºC). For a convection oven, reduce cooking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC). Line the baking sheet with parchment paper or silicone baking liner.
Remove the plastic wrap, and then wrap around the dough with a damp paper towel so that the dough will be slightly wet. Or of course, you can use traditional method and brush egg wash on the dough (but damp paper towel method works every time for me).
In a tray that fits the cookie dough, sprinkle the white sparkling sugar. Remove the damp paper towel and roll the cookie log on the sparkling sugar.
With a sharp knife, slice the dough into ⅓ inches (7 mm)-thick rounds. Place them on the baking sheet, leaving about 1” (2.5 cm) between rounds.
Gently press down the reserved cherry blossom and decorate on the cookie rounds. Tip: If the cookies are left out too long, place in the refrigerator for 10-15 minutes until the cookies are chilled (or the freezer for a short time); otherwise, the butter melts too quickly in the oven and the cookies will be flat.
Bake the cookies at 350ºF (170ºC) for about 15 minutes, or until the edge of the cookies start to get golden brown.
Remove from the oven and let cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes; then carefully transfer to a cooling rack and let cool completely.

You will need a medium saucepan, a heatproof mixing bowl (to set over the saucepan), and 2 large bowls. Make sure one of the large bowls can fit the mixing bowl and fill it with ice water, and set aside for Step 6.
In the saucepan, fill with 2 inches of water. Set the mixing bowl over and make sure the bottom of the bowl does not touch the water. Remove the bowl (will use it shortly for egg custard), and bring the water to barely a simmer, and reduce the heat to low.
To make the custard:
In the heatproof mixing bowl, add egg yolks, marsala wine, and 3 Tbsp granulated sugar and start whisking with a handheld electric mixer.
Set the bowl over the saucepan of barely simmering water and continue to beat the eggs. Keep your instant thermometer handy as you will be checking the temperature of the egg mixture. To consume Tiramisu safely, heat the egg yolk mixture until it reaches 160ºF (71ºC), about 10 minutes. 160ºF is close enough to turn the eggs into scrambled eggs; therefore, I highly recommend both an electric mixer and an instant-read thermometer for this process (please read my post).
Cook, beating constantly, until the custard is light and thick.
Continue whisking (I use level 3 of 5-speed hand mixer throughout the time).
Once the custard reaches 160ºF (71ºC), immediately remove the bowl from the saucepan and set in a large bowl of ice water. Let it cool down for 1 minute to quickly stop cooking.
Put the mascarpone in another large bowl and soften it with a silicone spatula. Gradually fold the custard into the mascarpone.
Take note: the egg yolk mixture does get cooked a bit on the side of the bowl from the double boiler. Do not scrape off to use it.
Gently fold in until just smooth (the custard will be grainy if over mixed).
In a large bowl (you can reuse the bowl from ice bath, but make sure it's completely dry), beat heavy (whipping) cream until foamy, and gradually add sugar.
Beat until medium peak forms.
Gradually fold in the heavy cream mixture into the mascarpone mixture.
Fold in the mixture until well combined.
To assemble:
Combine the hot water (175ºF/80ºC) and matcha powder and whisk until there is no lumps. Transfer to a flat-bottom container that fits ladyfingers.
One at a time, quickly dip both sides of the ladyfingers in the matcha mixture until soaked but not soggy. Place them on the bottom of an 8""x8"" (20x20 cm) baking dish, arranging 2 rows of 6 ladyfingers each.
Spread half of the mascarpone custard over the ladyfingers. Smooth out the surface.
Dip the remaining ladyfingers in the matcha mixture and place them on top of the custard.
Top with the remaining custard, smooth out the top, and cover with a sheet of plastic wrap to cover the cream. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours, preferably overnight.
Before serving, dust with matcha powder and enjoy!

I shared more detailed info in the post, so please visit the blog post of this recipe.
Prepare Cake Pan
Cut parchment paper for the bottom and side of cake pan. You will need a 9” (23 cm) round paper for the bottom, one 4” x 30” (10 x 76 cm) paper for the side of cake pan, and two 2” x 30” (5 x 76 cm) paper strips which will be used for “transporting”.
Grease the cake pan and parchment paper (for bottom and sides) with butter (15 g). You don't need to use all of it.
Place the 2 “straps” criss-cross on the bottom of the cake pan. Then place the bottom and side parchment paper. The grease side of the 9” (23 cm) paper should face up, and face in on the 4” x 30” (10 x 76 cm) paper.
Preheat the Oven & Gather Ingredients
Preheat the oven to 350ºF (180ºC). You will be baking at 320ºF (160ºC) but when you open the oven to place the cheesecake you’ll lose some heat, so we’ll start off a bit higher.
Please note that it is very important that ingredients are all measured before starting. Separate the 6 eggs into egg yolks and egg whites. Refrigerate the egg whites.
Mix over Double Boiler
Set a medium saucepan filled with 2” (5 cm) water and bring to simmer. Add cream cheese (300 g), unsalted butter (60 g), heavy whipping cream (200 ml), and granulated sugar (60 g) in a large bowl. Put the bowl over the saucepan.
Using a silicone spatula, mash the cream cheese and butter. Once they are melted, use whisk to blend everything together. Remove from the heat.
Mix at the Counter
In the warm cream cheese mixture add 6 egg yolks, one yolk at a time while whisking. Make sure each egg yolk blended well with the mixing before adding the next one.
Using a fine-mesh strainer, sift cake flour (80 g) into the batter. Whisk and blend together.
Then pass the batter through the same fine mesh strainer to a clean large bowl, creating the silky texture for the batter.
Zest half of a lemon into the batter. Make sure you only zest the yellow part, not the bitter white part. Then squeeze half lemon into a small bowl. Measure lemon juice (30 ml) and add to the batter. Whisk well to blend and set aside.
Set Up Bain-Marie
Put the baking sheet inside the oven and pour hot water until half way or 1 inch deep. Close the oven.
Beat Egg Whites
Add cold egg whites into a large clean mixing bowl (of the stand mixer). Make sure there is no oil or water in the bowl. If you have space in your refrigerator, I highly recommend keeping the mixing bowl cold until you’re ready to use it. Start whisking on medium speed (speed 4) until the egg whites become opaque, foamy, and bubbly, about 2 minutes. Then slowly add 100 g granulated sugar, ⅓ portion at a time while the mixer runs.
Once all the sugar has been added, increase the mixer speed to high (speed 8-9) and beat the egg whites until “soft” to “medium” peaks. When lift the whisk, the egg whites shouldn’t fold ribbons (drizzle) anymore. When you turn your whisk upside down, the egg whites should cling to the whisk and hold their shape for a few seconds, but then start to flop over.
Fold in Egg Whites
Using a whisk, mix in ⅓ of egg whites into the cream cheese mixture until incorporated. Then gently fold in another ⅓ into the mixture.
Lastly, pour the mixture back into the mixer bowl (with ⅓ of egg whites still in it) and fold in very gently.
Pour the mixture into the baking pan in all at once, avoiding air pockets while pouring. Tap the cake pan a few times on the kitchen counter to release any air pockets in the batter.
Bake the Cheesecake
Place the cake pan into the baking sheet that’s already in the oven. Reduce the oven temperature to 320ºF (160ºC) and start baking for 70-75 minutes. Then, reduce the oven temperature to 300ºF (150ºC) and bake for another 10 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the skewer inserted comes out clean. For a convection oven, reduce cooking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC).
Let Cool
Turn off the oven and leave the oven door ajar for 15-20 minutes with the cake inside. If you take the cake out immediately, the sudden change of temperature could cause the cake to shrink or collapse. You want the cake to slowly shrink down to half the height, roughly from 4 inches to 2 inches. Remove the pan from the oven. Gently pull out the cake using the 2 parchment paper straps (with another set of hand).
Remove the parchment paper around the cake (leave the bottom one). Combine apricot jam (2 Tbsp) and hot water (2 tsp) in a small bowl. Brush the apricot mixture over the top of the cheesecake. Let cool to room temperature.
To Serve
You can serve the cake at room temperature (fluffiest!) or chill the cake for 1-2 hours before serving.
To Store
You can store the cake in the refrigerator for up to 3-4 days or in the freezer for 3-4 weeks. Defrost the cake overnight in the refrigerator. The cold cheesecake is dense, so leave it at the counter till chilled/room temperature before serving.",en-US,4.68,,Just One Cookbook,170,1 serving(s),,,,,,,,,,,

In a small saucepan, heat soy milk over medium heat until warm to the touch. Keep a close eye on the pot and DO NOT BOIL. Turn off the heat.
In a bowl with matcha green tea powder, add a little bit of soy milk. Now using a whisk or chasen (bamboo whisk), combine the soy milk and matcha together. Tip 1: Matcha dissolves easier when liquid is warm. Tip 2: Gradually add in the soy milk. DO NOT pour too much soy milk at once. Superfine matcha powder can easily turn into lumps and it will be harder to combine.
Add more soy milk as you needed, until the mixture becomes a smooth paste and there are no more lumps of matcha.
Add the matcha paste back into the soy milk in the pot. Whisk it well to combine.
In a new pot, add water and powdered kanten (agar agar).
Whisk together and bring it to a boil on medium-high heat. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook for 2 minutes until the powder is completely dissolved.

Joshinko and Shiratamako on the left and Dangoko on the right. Whichever you decide to use, the instructions below are the same.
Gather ingredients for the sweet soy glaze. Soak the skewers in water. You can start boiling a large pot of water on low heat (See Step 8)
To Make Dango (Rice Dumplings)
Combine Shiratamako and Joshinko in a bowl (or add just Dangoko in a bowl).
Stir in warm water (or cold water for Dangoko) a little bit at a time while mixing with chopsticks. Please note: it is possible that you may need less or more water depending on where you live. I live in a dry climate, so I may use more water than you.
The flours start to stick together and eventually it becomes clumps. Using your hands, combine into one ball.
Knead until the dough becomes smooth. The texture is like squeezing an ""earlobe"" (that’s how we describe the tenderness for this type of mochi in Japanese).
Make the dough into a ball. Divide the dough into 8 equal pieces.
Then divide each piece into 2 balls. You will have 16 equal-sized balls. I always like to measure mine. Each ball should be 20 grams. You may have some extra dough, but that’s okay.
Shape into a nice smooth round ball. If the dough is cracking or has some wrinkle, tap your finger in water and apply the small amount of water on the cracked area to smooth out. I have 16 equal-sized balls.
Once the water in the pot is boiling, gently drop in each dumpling into the pot with a continuous motion. We want to cook them all at once, but also keeping them in good shapes. Stir the balls occasionally so they don’t stick on the bottom of the pot.
Dumplings will stay on the bottom first but once they are cooked, they will float. Then cook an additional 1-2 minute.
Transfer the dumplings into iced water.
Once the dumplings are cooled, drain well and transfer to a tray (if you wet the tray, the dumplings won’t stick).
Skewer three pieces into a bamboo skewer. Continue the rest of the balls and set aside.
To Make Sweet Soy Glaze
Combine all the ingredients in a saucepan without turning on the heat.
Potato starch/cornstarch will become lumps once you add the heat to it, so mix all together first. Then turn on the heat and continue to whisk.
Keep whisking as the mixture can become thick suddenly.
When the sauce becomes thick, remove the saucepan from the heat and transfer the sauce to a container or bowl. If you are making this sauce ahead of time, remove it from the heat earlier while the consistency is still not too thick because the moisture will evaporate and thicken as it cools.
To Serve
[Optional] If you have a kitchen torch, you can give them a little bit of char for taste. You can also grill over the direct heat (If you are going to place on a wire rack, dumplings tend to stick, so grease it). You can use a broiler to give a char or use a non-stick frying pan to pan fry the surface of dango.
Pour the sweet soy glaze on top and serve immediately.

Combine shiratamako and sugar in a medium bowl and whisk all together.
Add water and mix well until combined.
Microwave Method: If you’re using a microwave to cook mochi, cover the bowl with some plastic wrap (do not cover too tight). Put the bowl in the microwave and heat it on high heat (1100w) for 1 minute. Take it out and stir with wet rubber spatula. Cover again and cook for 1 minute. Stir again, cover, and cook for 30 seconds to finish cooking. The color of mochi should change from white to almost translucent.
Steaming Method: If you’re using a steamer, cover the steamer lid with a towel so the condensation won’t drop into the mochi mixture. Put the bowl into a steamer basket and cover to cook for 15 minutes. Halfway cooking, stir with a wet rubber spatula and cover to finish cooking. The color of mochi should change from white to almost translucent.
Cover the work surface with parchment paper and dust it generously with potato starch. Then transfer the cooked mochi on top.
To prevent from sticking, sprinkle more potato starch on top of the mochi. Once it’s cool down a bit, you can spread the mochi into a thin layer with your hands or with a rolling pin. Make sure to apply potato starch on your hands and the rolling pin. I recommend using a rolling pin because it’s easier to evenly spread out.
Transfer the mochi with parchment paper onto a large baking sheet. Refrigerate for 15 minutes until the mochi is set.
Take out the mochi from the refrigerator and cut out 7-8 circles with the 3.5 inch (9 cm) cookie cutter.
Dust off the excess potato starch with a pastry brush. If you find some sticky part, cover the area with potato starch first then dust off. Place a plastic wrap on a plate and then mochi wrapper on top, then lay another layer of plastic wrapper down. Repeat for all wrappers. With leftover mochi dough, roll into a ball and then flatten into a thin layer again and cut out into more circle wrappers (I could make about 12 mochi wrappers).
Now we’re ready to make daifuku mochi. On the work surface, place one sheet of plastic wrap with a mochi layer on top. Using the cookie scoop, scoop out anko on top of the mochi wrapper.
Pinch the four corners of the mochi layer together to wrap the anko. Then pinch the remaining corners together.
Put some potato starch on the sealed area and set aside. Continue making the rest of daifuku mochi. Store in a cool dry place (refrigerator in summer months) and enjoy within two days.",en-US,4.58,,Just One Cookbook,48,12 serving(s),,,,,,,,,,,

Gather all the ingredients. If possible, keep all ingredients chilled in the refrigerator until ready to start.
Cut the butter into small cubes. Crack the egg into a small bowl.
Choice #1 - Pastry Cutter:
In a large bowl, stir together the flour, sugar, and salt.
Add the butter to the flour mixture. Using a pastry cutter or 2 knives, cut the butter into flour mixture until the texture resembles coarse cornmeal, with butter pieces no larger than small peas.
Add the egg and vanilla extract and mix with a fork just until the dough pulls together.
Choice #2 - Food Processor:
Process all-purpose flour, sugar, and salt in a food processor for a few seconds until combined.
Add the butter and pulse until mixture resembles coarse meal, about 15 pulses.
Add the egg and vanilla extract and pulse until the dough forms clumps, about 15 seconds.
Form Dough into a Disk
Transfer the dough clumps to a lightly floured surface (I use this pastry mat) and form into a ball. If sticky, lightly sprinkle flour.
Flatten the ball with your hands to form a thick disk. Wrap with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour (or 30 mins in the freezer). The dough must be completely chilled before being used. To store: If you don’t use the dough right away, you can store in the refrigerator for up to 3 days, or freeze it for up to 2 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator, then let sit at room temperature until easily rollable.
Roll Out the Dough
Take the dough out from the refrigerator and let it sit on the counter for a few minutes to soften slightly for easy rolling. Meanwhile lightly butter a 9-inch (23 cm) fluted tart pan with a removable bottom.
Lightly flour your working surface and place the dough on top. Using a rolling pin, roll out the dough into an 11-inch circle, with 1/8-inch (3 mm) thick. If the dough is too soft, put back into the refrigerator.
Flour the rolling pin and roll the dough loosely around it, then unroll it into the tart pan.
Evenly pat the dough onto the bottom and sides of the greased tart pan. Seal any cracks in the dough.
Trim off excess dough with a sharp knife, or with the rolling pin by rolling over the tart pan. A good tip I learned from a Japanese cookbook (optional): Using your index finger, gently press the dough onto the side so the dough will peak out 2 mm from the pan. The dough tends to shrink while baking, so this helps to keep the height of the crust.
With a fork, gently prick the dough several times. Cover the tart pan with plastic wrap and place in the freezer until firm, about 30 minutes. Freezing the dough before baking prevents it from shrinking.
Blind Bake the Crust
To prevent the crust from becoming soggy, I always like to blind bake the crust. Preheat the oven to 375ºF (190ºC) and place the rack in the center. For a convection oven, reduce cooking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC).
When the oven is ready, tightly line the chilled crust with 2 layers of parchment paper, covering the edges to prevent them from burning. Fill the crust with pie weights (or dried beans, uncooked rice, pennies, etc). Make sure they are evenly distributed over the entire surface.
Bake the crust for 20 minutes, until the foil no longer sticks to the dough. Transfer the crust to a wire rack and remove the pie weights and parchment paper.
To partially bake the crust, continue to bake the crust for 5 minutes longer. Proceed with your tart recipe: add the filling and finish baking. Check your recipe to see if the crust should be used while warm or after it’s been left to cool on a wire rack.
To fully bake the crust, bake for 10 minutes longer or until it is dry and the bottom turns lightly golden. Remove the crust from the oven and place on a wire rack to cool.
To Store the Baked Crust
The baked crust can be stored at room temperature or refrigerator for 2 days or frozen for 2 months. When ready to serve, let it thaw overnight in the refrigerator, then let sit at room temperature before filling and decorating.",en-US,4.44,,Just One Cookbook,50,1 serving(s),,,,,,,,,,,

Make a ""partially baked"" crust by following this step. You can make the tart crust ahead of time.
To Make the Almond Cream Filling (Frangipane)
Gather all the ingredients. Make sure to take out the butter and eggs from the refrigerator and keep at room temperature. If the eggs are too cold when you add to the mixture, they reduce the temperature of the butter, making emulsion more difficult. Adding the eggs all at once also inhibits emulsion, and results in that scrambled egg appearance. You can soak the cold eggs for 5 minutes in warm (not hot!) water, but it's best to take out both butter and eggs out from the fridge earlier.
In a large bowl, cream the softened unsalted butter.
Add confectioners’ sugar and mix well until the mixture resembles a coarse meal.
Add almond flour, all-purpose flour, and salt, and mix well.
Add eggs one at a time and incorporate into the mixture.
Add vanilla extract, almond extract, and rum.
Whisk until homogenized and smooth. The almond cream can be kept refrigerated for up to 3 to 5 days or frozen for weeks.
For the Assembly
Preheat the oven to 375ºF (190ºC). For a convection oven, reduce cooking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC). Melt the apricot jam and 1 Tbsp water in the microwave for 10 seconds until liquefied. Apply the jam on the base of the cooled pastry case to prevent soggy bottom. Reserve the jam for later. Fill the baked tart crust with almond cream, smoothing out to the edges with an offset spatula, and refrigerate for 30 minutes to set.
Meanwhile, peel the pears, cut each in half lengthwise, and scoop out cores.
Cut each half crosswise into ⅛ inch (3 mm) slices. Squeeze the lemon and rub the pears with lemon juice to prevent browning.
Take out the tart crust from the refrigerator. Gently press each pear half to fan out toward the stem/top side. Slide the knife under pears and transfer to the almond filling.
Arrange the top with points facing in and pears fanning out toward the center. Make sure to space pears out so they are not touching, as the filling will puff up and they need room to expand.
Bake the Tart
Bake the tart at 375ºF (190ºC) until golden brown or the bamboo skewer inserted into the center of filling comes out clean, about 40-45 minutes.
Remove the tart from the oven and let cool in the pan on the wire rack. Brush the pears with the leftover apricot jam. Once it’s cool, carefully unmold the tart.
Toast the almond slices in the frying pan (no oil) until golden, about 5 minutes.
Sprinkle confectioners’ sugar and toasted almond slices on top, if desired, and serve slightly warm. Cut into wedges and enjoy!

Wet your hands and roll anko into 6 small balls between hands.
Drain well and put the sweet rice in a large bowl.

In a large bowl, using a handheld mixer or a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter for 30 seconds.
Add ½ cup sugar and 2 Tbsp miso.
Beat everything together on medium-high speed until smooth, light, and fluffy, about 2 minutes.
Crack the egg and whisk in a small bowl. Gradually add the egg to the butter mixture while mixing.
Beat on high speed until combined, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl and beat again as needed to combine in between.
In a small bowl, combine 1 ⅔ cup all-purpose flour and 1 tsp baking powder and mix with a fork (I do this extra step so that baking powder is evenly distributed when sifting).
With a fine-mesh sieve, sift the flour mixture over a medium bowl.
Gradually add the flour mixture into the mixing bowl at low speed.
Once you finish adding all the flour mixture, turn up to high speed and beat until incorporated.
Sprinkle a small amount of flour on the working surface and transfer the dough. If the dough is too soft, chill in the refrigerator for 15 minutes. By chilling, the butter/fat will solidify and it'll be easier to work with.
Roll the dough into a ball and cut in half. Note: This recipe can be used for cut out cookies. Form the dough into a disk, wrap and chill then roll out to ¼-½ inch, cut and bake.
Roll the dough into 2 long logs.
Each log should be 10 inches (25 cm) long with 1 inch (2.5 cm) diameter.
Cut the long logs in half; now you have four 5-inch (12.5 cm) logs.
Prepare a small flat container (or baking sheet) and add white sesame seeds (save the black one for later a time). Moist a sheet of paper towel with water and wrap around a log so the dough is moistened.
Roll the moistened log in the sesame seeds and wrap in parchment paper or plastic.
I've learned the best way to keep the dough from flattening out on the bottom is to place the dough on rice.
Roll the other 2 logs in the black sesame seeds and wrap in parchment paper or plastic.
Chill the cookie dough in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). For a convection oven, reduce cooking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC). Prepare a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
Once the dough is chilled, use a sharp knife to cut dough into 8 slices of even thickness.
Cut the rest of the cookie dough and transfer to the baking sheet lined with parchment paper. If the dough is no longer chilled, you can put the baking sheet in the refrigerator for 15 minutes until the cookies are chilled and firm. Tip: If the cookie dough is chilled, they will not completely lose their shape.
Bake the chilled cookies for 20-22 minutes or until lightly browned on the edges.
Remove from the oven and allow to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.

Gather all the ingredients. You will also need eight 4-oz (120-ml) ramekins.
1: To Make Caramel Sauce:
Prepare boiling water (you will only need 2 Tbsp) and a cold damp towel (for Step 4).
In a small saucepan, combine ⅔ cup (140 g) sugar and 2 Tbsp water over medium heat. Stir a few times and let the sugar dissolved.
Once the mixture comes to a boil, about 4 minutes, lower the heat to simmer. Gently swirl and tilt the pot around the heat (don't stir it) to distribute the color evenly until it becomes amber (like darker honey), about 6 minutes.
Once it reaches the desired amber color, immediately remove the pot from heat to a cold damp towel and add 2 Tbsp boiling water. It will create a huge splash so please be careful. You can shield yourself with a lid or wear oven mitts to protect your hands. Stir the saucepan to mix together. This will slightly thin out the caramel sauce and ensure it doesn’t become too thick in the ramekins.
[Optional] Briefly dip the ramekins in hot water to warm up and shake off excess water. This will prevent the caramel from solidifying.
While caramel is still hot, evenly distribute the caramel among the 8 ramekins. Set aside and let the caramel thicken naturally (which is why the caramel will not mix with the custard mixture later).
2: To Make Custard
In a small heat-resistant bowl, cut 4 gelatin sheets* into thin ½ inch (1.3 cm) strips. Add ¼ cup (60 ml) water to the bowl and set aside for 5-6 minutes until the gelatin “blooms” (expands). Make sure the bowl is larger than the opening of the saucepan you'll be using in Step 3 below.
In a saucepan bring 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water to simmer and place the bowl of gelatin mixture over the saucepan. Steam will immediately warm up the glass bowl and start dissolving the gelatin. Turn off the heat and set aside. If somehow you end up taking a longer time to do the following process and the gelatin has set into a solid, you will need to melt it back into a liquid with double boiler again.
In a large mixing bowl, whisk together 4 egg yolks and ⅓ cup + 1 Tbsp (80 g) sugar until pale and creamy.
In a medium saucepan, heat ⅔ cup (150 ml) milk over medium heat until the milk is warm to the touch. We’ll be using the other half of milk later on.
Slowly add in the warm milk, whisking constantly (tempering the egg mixture).
Pour the mixture back into the saucepan. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture coats a spoon with a thin film, or small bubbles start to form at the edges of the saucepan, or reaches 160ºF (71ºC). Keep an eye on the pot ALL THE TIME; otherwise the mixture will burn on the bottom.
Add in the gelatin mixture (from Step 2 above) and mix well. Remove from the heat.
Strain the mixture through a fine sieve into a clean bowl. Stir in the rest of the milk (⅔ cup, 150 ml).
Add ½ cup (120 ml) heavy whipping cream and 2 tsp vanilla. We’re adding them at the end to help the mixture cool down faster.
Whisk all together. Transfer the mixture into a large cup with a pout (optional).
Divide the custard into the 8 ramekins. Cover with plastic wrap and chill in the fridge overnight or up to 3 days. The caramel on the bottom will become thinner after the moisture from the custard transfers to the caramel.
Day 2 – Making Dorayaki
Gather all the ingredients.
In a large bowl, combine 4 eggs, ⅔ cup (140 g) sugar, and 2 Tbsp honey and whisk well until the mixture becomes fluffy.
Sift 1 ⅓ cup (160 g) all-purpose flour and 1 tsp baking powder into the bowl and mix all together.
Keep in the fridge to rest for 15 minutes.
About 5 minutes before taking out the batter from the fridge, start heating a large non-stick frying pan over low heat. It's best to take your time and heat the pan slowly so there will be no hot spots. I keep the heat setting to the lowest for 5 minutes.
Take out the batter from the refrigerator. The batter should be slightly smoother now. Stir in 2 Tbsp* of water and whisk to combine until the batter reaches the ribbon stage (When you lift the whisk over the mixture, the batter falls slowly forming thick ribbons which hold their shape atop the batter). *Depends on the size of eggs and how accurate your flour measurement is, the water amount may vary, so start adding 1 Tbsp first, then slowly add more if needed.
Dip a paper towel in 1 tsp vegetable oil and coat the bottom of the pan with the oil. Then wipe off the oil completely (that's the key for evenly golden brown dorayaki surface).
With a ladle or a small measuring cup (I use a 4 Tbsp measuring cup), pour 3 Tbsp of the batter from 3"" (8 cm) above the pan to create 3"" (8 cm) diameter pancakes. Set timer for 90 seconds (with my gas stove ""low setting"" and frying pan).
Using an offset spatula, release the edges of the pancake, and then switch to a larger spatula and flip. Cook the other side for 30 seconds and then transfer to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or silicone baking mat. You do not need to oil the pan again. Continue making pancakes; you can make about 12 3-inch (8-cm) pancakes total.
Final Step – Assembly
To serve, run a small sharp knife around the edge of each ramekin to loosen the custard.
Place a pancake on your serving plate and invert the custard onto the center of the pancake. If it doesn’t release right away, gently shake the ramekin a few times or insert a knife/toothpick around the edges to release the custard. Place another pancake on top to sandwich the purin. Enjoy!

Insert chocolate sprinkles into Twinkie or draw hair with black icing on Twinkie to represent Minion’s hair.
Dip the Twinkie into the blue candy melts till the bottom of the bib. Remove the excess candy melts. I find out later that it helps when you draw the minion’s mouth at the end so that you have more place to hold Twinkie when you dip.

Gather all the ingredients.
Option 1: Pressure Cooker
Rinse the azuki beans carefully until water is clear. Discard any damaged beans that are floating. Drain water and transfer the beans to the pressure cooker (I use an Instant Pot).
Add in 4 cups of water. Cover and lock the lid of your pressure cooker. Make sure the steam release handle points at “sealing” and not venting.
Turn on your pressure cooker and select High Pressure for 15 minutes (10 minutes if you prefer to keep the beans slightly firm). If you’re using an Instant Pot, press “Manual” or “Pressure Cooker”, select “high pressure” and adjust the cooking time.
If you are using a stovetop pressure cooker, cook on high heat until high pressure is reached. Then reduce the heat to low to maintain the pressure for 15 minutes.
When it’s done cooking, the Instant Pot will switch automatically to the “Keep Warm” mode. Let the pressure slowly release by itself for 30 minutes (Natural Release). Before opening the lid, turn the steam release handle to “Venting” and release any leftover pressure. If you’re using the stovetop pressure cooker, remove the pot from the heat and let the pressure release naturally.
Add salt and sugar into the pot.
Press the “Saute” button and select “Low” heat. Let the sugar dissolved completely, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes.
After cooking for 5 minutes, the soup will be a bit darker in color, too. Keep warm and start preparing the mochi (please scroll down).
Option 2: Stovetop Method
Rinse the azuki beans carefully until water is clear. Discard any damaged beans that are floating and drain.
Put the azuki beans and water in a pot.
Bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat. Once boiling, put an otoshibuta (drop lid) over the azuki beans. Turn down the heat to medium-low and keep it simmering for the next 1 to 1.5 hours. Tip: Otoshibuta will prevent the beans from dancing around too much. You can make it with aluminum foil.
Water will evaporate so you need to keep adding water so the beans are submerged. After 1 hour, pick one bean and mash it with your fingers. If it is mashed easily, it's done. Otherwise, cook another 15 minutes and check. Add sugar and salt and let the sugar dissolved completely, stirring occasionally. Keep warm and start preparing the mochi (please scroll down).
★ Making Zenzai with Red Bean Paste (Makes 1) ★
In a small saucepan, combine the store-bought red bean paste or homemade red bean paste and water and bring it to a boil. Add a pinch of salt and mix well. Adjust the consistency by adding or evaporating water. Keep warm and start preparing the mochi (see next step).
★ To Prepare Mochi and Serve ★
Cut the kirimochi into halves or quarters and place them in the toaster oven (or the oven). If you're using the fresh homemade mochi, add it in the soup to warm up. If it's frozen, then boil it in a pot till soft.
Toast the mochi until puffed up and nicely brown, about 10-12 minutes.

With a pastry brush, coat the inside souffle ramekins with softened butter.
Put some granulated sugar in the ramekin and cover the opening with your hand and circulate. Once sugar is attached to the ramekin, remove the excess to the next ramekin and continue this process until all ramekins are coated with sugar.
Chop the chocolate into small pieces.
Pour the half-and-half into a saucepan and heat over medium high heat until bubbles begin to form around the edge of the pan.
Remove from the heat and make a ganache by adding the chopped chocolate. Stir well until combined and all of the chocolate has melted.
Make a double-boiler by setting a large mixing bowl over a pot of boiling water. Place the ganache in the mixing bowl.
Add the cocoa powder and water, and mix until very hot. Remove from the heat and set aside.
Place the egg whites in a stand mixer and whip on medium speed until foamy.
Increase the mixer speed to medium-high and make a meringue. Add 1 Tbsp. sugar at a time and whip the whites till stiff but do not over whip the egg whites.
Use a rubber spatula to gently fold about half the meringue into the warm chocolate mixture.
Then fold (not mix) the chocolate mixture into the remaining meringue in a standing mixer bowl. Do not deflate the batter. It’s okay if you still see streaks of meringue in the batter.
Use a large spoon to gently place the souffle mixture in the ramekins. Fill to about 1/4 inch below the rim of the ramekin. Run your thumb around the rim to remove the excess butter and sugar. Place the ramekins in a baking pan (for easy transfer to and from oven).

In a small saucepan, add 2 cups (480 ml) of water and 4 gram kanten powder. Whisk to combine and bring it to a boil.
Once boiling, lower the heat and cook for 2 minutes. Whisk occasionally and make sure kanten powder has completely dissolved. After 2 minutes, remove from the heat.
Add ¼ cup (4 Tbsp) sugar and whisk till sugar is completely dissolved.
Run water in the mold (or nagashikan) and pour the liquid until there is about ⅓ inch (8 mm) in the mold (so that fruits won't touch the bottom). Using a spoon or toothpick, move the bubbles on the liquid to the corner and remove them. Let cool in the refrigerator for just under 10 minutes or at room temperature for a little longer time.
Meanwhile cut fruits for the jelly.
The thickness of the fruits should be about the same.
When the bottom layer is slightly set (not liquid or completely set), place the fruits on top. If the bottom layer set too firm, the top layer will not attach to the bottom layer well and the fruit jelly will separate into the top and bottom layers when you cut. The liquid in the saucepan should not be solidified since the saucepan is still warm and it has more liquid in there. If solidify, then re-heat till it turns to liquid.
Then pour the rest of the mixture and pop/remove the bubbles. Keep in the fridge until the jelly has set completely.

You will also need a 17cm (7"") chiffon cake pan. Make sure you use the correct chiffon cake pan. The best types are the aluminum ones with a removable base (Do not use non-stick bakeware for chiffon cake – it will not work). Do not grease the mold because the cake needs to cling on the sides and center of the pan for support as it rises or it will collapse.
Preheat the oven to 340ºF (170ºC). For a convection oven, reduce cooking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC). Separate 3 eggs to yolks and whites. Egg yolks in a large bowl, and whites in a smaller bowl.
In the bowl with egg yolks, add roughly ⅓ of granulated sugar and whisk until creamy pale yellow color.
Add 3 Tbsp (40 ml) vegetable oil and zest of 1-2 Meyer lemons (I love more zest in the cake so I use 2, but you can use one).
Cut Meyer lemons in half. Juice all of it (4 halves).
If you don’t have 4 Tbsp (¼ cup or 60 ml) of juice, add water.
Add 4 Tbsp (¼ cup or 60 ml) juice to the egg mixture and whisk well.
Sift 75 g (2.6 oz) cake flour and 1 tsp baking powder into the egg mixture. Whisk until totally incorporated and make sure there are no lumps.
Using a stand mixer (make sure there is no trace of water or oil), whip the egg whites on medium low sped (speed 4) till opaque, foamy and bubbly. Add ⅓ of the remaining granulated sugar and continue whipping.
After 30 seconds or so, increase the stand mixer speed to high (speed 10) and add the remaining sugar slowly in small increments.
It takes about 2-3 minutes until stiff peaks form (from the moment you switched to speed 10, but this is just a rough estimate). To check on stiff peaks, pull up your whisk and see if the egg whites go straight up (stiff peak) and just the tip is soft enough that it folds over, like taking a bow.
Using a whisk, fold in ⅓ of the egg whites in the batter until the mixture is homogeneous.
Fold in the rest of egg whites in 2-3 increments and mix gently until the mixture is homogeneous.
Pour the batter into the ungreased 17 cm (7”) chiffon cake pan in same location to prevent from forming more bubbles.
To remove or prevent air pockets before baking, run a skewer (chopstick, knife or spatula) through the batter and then drop the pan gently on the kitchen counter a few times.
Bake at 340ºF (170ºC) for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean and the top of the cake springs back when gently pressed. If the top gets burn too quickly, cover the top loosely with aluminum foil.
As soon as you take out the cake pan from the oven, drop it gently on the kitchen counter to stop shrinking. The cake must be cooled upside down in its pan so that it stretches downward instead of collapsing. Stick the cake pan on a tall heavy bottle or invert the cake pan onto a cooling rack (if you use angel food cake pan). Let it cool completely.
To extract the cake, run a thin sharp knife or thin offset spatula around both the outer and inner edge of the cake.
Remove the cake from the pan and run the knife on the bottom. Move onto a serving plate.

Wash the strawberries well, especially the leaf area, and dry them completely with paper towel.
Cut the chocolate into smaller pieces and put it in a microwave-safe medium glass bowl.
First, microwave 30 seconds. Make sure to adjust the power to 50%/medium. If you don’t know how to change the power, do 15 seconds intervals. When microwave beeps, take it out and stir with a spoon. Remember, your chocolate will NOT look melted until you stir it.
From the second time, microwave (50% power) for 15 seconds till the chocolate melts. Make sure to stir very well after each interval because even though it “looks” the chocolate hasn’t melted, when you stir it is very soft and the chocolate can be very soft already. Also, if you use chocolate chips, microwave in even shorter intervals because it's easily burnt.
As the chocolate softens, microwave in shorter intervals like 5-8 seconds. When the chocolate is almost completely melted, no more microwave. Just stir it vigorously so the remaining heat will melt the chocolate.
After the chocolate has completely melted, hold the bowl in one hand and grab the stem of strawberry gently with the other hand and dip in the chocolate mixture.
Hold for a few seconds to let the excess drip off.
Place on the parchment paper and push the strawberry slightly forward so the excess chocolate won’t be collected in front of the strawberry (won't look good). Keep in the fridge until you are ready to serve.

After 8-12 hours, you can easily remove the beans’ skin with your fingers. Discard the skin.
Add the beans in the pot and pour cold water just enough to cover the beans. To properly cook the beans, you will use just enough water and don’t let the beans move around in the water.
Bring it to a boil on medium heat. Let it boil for 2 minutes while foam starts to appear.
Drain the water into the sieve. Quickly rinse the pot and put the beans back in the pot. Add cold water just enough to cover the beans.
Cover with a lid (slightly ajar and let simmer on low heat until beans become tender, about 1.5 to 2 hours. You can shorten the cooking time by using a pressure cooker (high pressure for 15-20 minutes).
Once in a while check the beans and skim off the foam on the surface. This helps to make the white paste even whiter. Add a bit more water if the water is not covering the beans. Make sure the amount of water is just enough to cover the beans.
When you can easily crush the beans between two fingers, it’s done.
Drain the liquid. You may want to save a little bit of cooking liquid for the next step.
Transfer a small portion of drained beans to your fine-meshed strainer (this tool is also a flour sifter) over a large plate. Press the beans through the strainer using a wooden spatula. You will get a finer and smoother paste built up under the sieve/over the plate. If it’s too dry, put a tiny bit of cooking liquid on the beans before pressing. Alternatively, you can use a food processor to puree the beans. Add a little bit of cooking liquid if necessary.
Put the paste in a clean saucepan. Add the sugar and salt and mix well to combine.
Turn on the heat to medium low heat and let the sugar dissolve. The paste will become liquidy.
Then let the moisture evaporate from the mixture on medium low heat until it becomes a smooth mold-able paste, roughly 15-20 minutes. Keep an eye on the paste all the time to make sure it doesn't burn. When you can draw a line on the bottom of the pan, it’s done.

In a large bowl, whisk egg yolks and add ⅓ of the sugar. Then add oil and water and whisk all together till combined.
Sift cake flour, matcha, and baking powder together and add to the egg yolk mixture in 3 separate times. Whisk until totally incorporated and make sure there are no lumps.
Using a stand mixer, whip the egg whites on medium low speed (speed 4) till opaque and foamy and bubbly.
Add ⅓ of the remaining sugar and continue whipping. After 30 seconds or so, increase the stand mixer speed to high (speed 10) and add the remaining sugar slowly in small increments. It takes about 2 minutes (since you changed the speed to speed 10) until stiff peaks form.
To check on stiff peaks, pull up your whisk and see if the egg whites go straight up (stiff peak) and just the tip is soft enough that it folds over, like taking a bow.
Add ⅓ of the beaten egg whites into the flour mixture using a spatula until the mixture is homogeneous.
Fold in the rest of the egg whites in 2-3 increments and mix gently but quickly until the mixture is homogeneous.
Pour the mixture into the ungreased 17cm (7"") chiffon cake pan. Tap the pan a few times on the kitchen countertop to release the air bubbles.
Bake for 30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean.
The cake must be cooled upside down; stick the pan on a tall heavy bottle, leave until cake is completely cool before removing it from the pan.
Use a thin sharp knife or thin offset spatula and run it around the cake.
Place the serving plate on top and flip over. The cake will pop out easily. Enjoy!

Make sure the butter, eggs, and milk are all at room temperature. It’s important! Center a rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 350ºF (180ºC). For a convection oven, reduce cooking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC).
I use the leftover butter on the butter wrapping paper to grease the pan (8.5 x 4.5 x 2.75 inches). Then place the parchment paper inside the pan (paper will stick to the butter).
Put the softened butter in a large bowl and beat it with medium speed until it is light and fluffy (pale color) and lots of little tails foam around the beaters, about 1-2 minutes. Tip: This process adds air to the mixture, and it is crucial for the light and delicate texture of the pound cake.
Add the sugar to the whipped butter. Crean the butter and sugar thoroughly with medium speed (not high speed), about 5 minutes, until it is light and fluffy. The color is pale and sugar is completely dissolved. Tip: The sharp sugar grains cut through the butter and create the tiny air pockets that aerate the batter and cause leavening. This process is very important for the light and delicate texture of the pound cake.
Crack the eggs in a small bowl and whisk well.
IMPORTANT: To achieve a smooth mixture (not a curdled mixture), add in a very small amount (1 Tbsp) of the whisked egg in the mixture and beat well after each addition. Tip: The eggs contain water and the yolks and the butter are fats. Remember, oil and water will not mix without an emulsifier (in this case, the yolks), which suspends fat molecules in water making a smooth mixture.
If there is a slightly curdled appearance to the batter after adding the eggs, don’t worry. The emulsification is usually complete enough that the batter will become smooth with the addition of flour. The flour helps absorb some of the excess water.
Add the dry ingredients in 3 additions. In a fine-mesh strainer/sifter, add a mixture of 200 g (1 ½ cup) cake flour, 1 tsp baking powder, and ¼ tsp salt and sift a third of it over the egg mixture. Switch to a silicone spatula (or with mixer on the lowest speed), and mix the mixture by hand so you can scrape to the bottom of the bowl to get any little pockets of flour.
Now add another third of the dry ingredients and mix.
Stir in the last third addition. Mix only until the batter is smooth. Tip: Even though we are using a low protein cake flour, excess mixing will develop the gluten and the cake will rise nicely in the oven, then sink as soon as you pull it out. And the sinking cake is what makes a tougher cake and dense, moist, gluey streaks.
Heat 60 ml (¼ cup) milk in a microwave or saucepan until warm (roughly body temperature) and gradually add the milk to 20 g (3 Tbsp) matcha in the bowl, 1 Tbsp of milk at a time. Whisk well till combined. Tip: Warm liquid is easier to blend matcha.
Take ⅓ of the batter and add to the bowl with matcha.
Fold in just until the batter is smooth and homogenous. Do not overmix.
Add 6-8 dollops of matcha batter into the original batter. Then fold the entire batter from the bottom of the bowl THREE (3) times.
Pour the batter into the pan without mixing the batter, keeping the swirl effect. Tap the cake pan on the countertop once to release the trapped air.
Using the offset spatula, smooth out the surface without mixing too much.
Put the cake pan in the oven and lower the oven temperature to 340ºF (170ºC) oven for 50 to 60 minutes.
After 15 minutes, open the oven and quickly score the top of the cake with a sharp knife (Read the blog post why we do this). Continue to bake.
The cake is done when a wooden skewer inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean.
Remove from the oven and allow the cake to rest in the pan for 15 minutes on a wire rack before taking the cake out of the pan to cool completely. Enjoy!

Preheat the oven to 375ºF (190ºC). For a convection oven, reduce cooking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC). Line a 15” x 10” (38 cm x 25 cm) jelly roll pan with parchment paper.
Separate the egg yolks and whites into two bowls. Keep the egg whites in the refrigerator, and the egg yolk at room temperature.
Make the cake batter:
Using a fine mesh sieve, sift the cake flour, baking powder, and matcha powder over a sheet of parchment paper.
Transfer the dry ingredients into the bowl, set the sieve over the parchment paper and sift 2 more times (total 3 times).
In a large bowl, add the egg yolks and break them.
Add half of the sugar (¼ cup, 50 g) and whisk until the egg mixture becomes double in volume. When you lift the whisk into the air with some of the mixture on it, the mixture should fall back into the bowl in ribbons, which slowly disappear back into the mixture
Add the cold egg whites into a large bowl. With an electric hand mixer (or stand mixer), beat the egg whites until foamy.
Gradually add the remaining sugar (¼ cup, 50 g) over three separate times and beat until stiff peaks form and egg whites are glossy.
Gently whisk in ⅓ of the egg whites to the egg yolk mixture until incorporated in the batter.
Then add the mixture back into the egg whites. Gently fold in egg whites with a silicone spatula. Tip: Rotate the bowl counterclockwise while you scoop up and fold in the mixture clockwise.
Add the dry ingredients. Using the silicone spatula, fold in gently until just incorporated. Tip: Adding dry ingredients last prevents from mixing too much (over-mixing the batter will result in dense, not fluffy sponge cake).
Add the warm milk and fold in until incorporated.
Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Spread the batter evenly with silicone pastry scraper.
Bake in the oven:
Tap the jelly roll pan a few times on your working surface to remove the air bubble inside the batter. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until an inserted toothpick comes out clean and top of cake springs back when touched. Make sure not to over bake or the cake will be too dry and break when you roll.
Remove the pan from the oven and drop the pan on your working space once to prevent the cake from shrinkage.
While the pan is still hot, place a sheet of parchment paper and a baking sheet (or a cutting board) on top.
Wearing the oven mitts, flip the baking sheets together (with the cake sandwiched in between). Using a knife or spatula, lift the jelly roll pan to reveal the cake.
Gently remove the parchment paper attached to the cake. This side will be the exterior of the Swiss roll, so be gentle!
Place another “protective” sheet of parchment paper and baking sheet on top.
Hold both baking sheets and flip the cake over so that brown side is facing up. Remove the parchment paper.
Remove the baking sheet and place the cake on the working surface. Diagonally slice off ¼ inch (1 cm) one side of the cake (shorter end). This will help stabilize the Swiss roll when rolled up.
While the cake is still warm, use your hands to slowly roll the cake on the parchment paper. Once the cake is rolled up, transfer to a wire rack.
Cover with kitchen towel and let it cool completely (until it reaches room temperature, about 30 minutes).
To prepare matcha cream filling
When the cake is completely cool, combine the heavy cream, sugar, and matcha powder in a large bowl.
Beat until firm and spreadable, so it won’t ooze out of the cake when you’re rolling it up.
Assemble the Swiss cake:
Transfer the swiss roll to a flat surface and unroll the cake. It’s okay if the ends curl up a bit.
Using an offset spatula, spread the matcha cream mixture evenly over the cake, leaving a ½-inch border on all sides. A little tip: Spread slightly less amount of filling toward the last ⅓ of cake as the cream will pile up toward the end when rolling up.
Carefully but tightly re-roll the cake. The seam side should be on the bottom. Once you roll up the cake, secure the roll by twisting the parchment paper at both ends (like a candy wrapper). Refrigerate for at least 2 hours to firm up the cream.
Remove and unwrap the Swiss roll. Slice off about ½ inch of the cake on both ends (to show off beautiful swirls). Transfer it to your serving dish. Slice and serve.

Preheat the oven to 400ºF (200ºC). For a convection oven, reduce cooking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC). Cut the cold butter into small cubes.
Allow the puff pastry sheet to thaw on a sheet of parchment paper for about 15-20 minutes, then carefully unfold it. When the dough is thawed, use a rolling pin to roll out the dough: it helps make the dough more even and connects the folding creases (if there are any). Once puff pastry sheet has thawed, work quickly while it’s still cold. If the sheet reaches room temperature, return to the fridge to chill (but not refreeze).
With a sharp knife, score a ¾ -inch (2 cm) border around the edge of the puff pastry sheet to create a crust (Do not cut all the way through the dough). Poke the inner square (rectangle) all over with a fork. Transfer the puff pastry sheet with parchment paper to a rimmed baking sheet.
In a small bowl, add 2 Tbsp apricot jam and 1 tsp water. Stir well to combine so it’s easy to spread.
In another small bowl, combine the egg yolk and 1 tsp water. Whisk well together.
In another small bowl, combine 2 Tbsp sugar and ¼ tsp cinnamon powder.
Peel, core, and cut the apples into ⅛ inch (3 mm) thick slices. Try to keep the slices stacked together so you can easily spread and fan out on the puff pastry.
Evenly spread the apricot glaze in the center of the pastry sheet.
Arrange the apple slices on the jam, overlapping slightly and fanning them out as you go. You may end up not using all the apple slices, just eat and enjoy them.
Sprinkle with sugar and cinnamon mixture. Brush around the crust with the egg wash. And then place the butter cubes over the apples.
Bake at 400ºF (200ºC) for about 22 to 25 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown.

Put a glass bowl in the freezer in preparation for whipping the cream.
Whisk the egg whites until they form soft peaks.
Heat the honey in a pan until it starts to bubble. Pour it hot onto the egg whites then whisk for another minute or two.
Whip the cream in the chilled bowl until it’s stiff. Add the nuts and fruit (but keep some aside for the decoration) and fold the mixture gently into the beaten egg whites.

Equipment you will need:12 aluminum/silicone cupcake liners, a cookie dough scoop (smaller than an ice cream scooper), a rolling pin, and a 3.5 inch (9 cm) cookie cutter or a round bowl/glass cup.
Using the cookie scoop, scoop out ice cream into aluminum/silicone cupcake liners. The ice cream will melt quickly so I recommend freezing them immediately for a few hours or until ice cream balls are completely frozen solid.
Once the ice cream balls are frozen solid and ready, you can start making mochi. Combine shiratamako and sugar in a medium bowl and whisk all together.
Add water and mix well until combined.
Microwave Method: If you’re using a microwave to cook mochi, cover the bowl with some plastic wrap (do not cover too tight). Put the bowl in the microwave and heat it on high heat (1000w) for 1 minute. Take it out and stir with a wet rubber spatula. Cover again and cook for 1 minute. Stir again, cover, and cook for 30 seconds to finish cooking. The color of mochi should change from white to almost translucent.
Steaming Method: If you’re using a steamer, cover the steamer lid with a towel so the condensation won’t drop into the mochi mixture. Put the bowl into a steamer basket and cover to cook for 15 minutes. Half way cooking, stir with wet rubber spatula and cover to finish cooking. The color of mochi should change from white to almost translucent.
Cover the work surface with parchment paper and dust it generously with potato starch. Then transfer the cooked mochi on top.
To prevent from sticking, sprinkle more potato starch on top of the mochi. Once it’s cool down a bit, you can spread the mochi into a thin layer with your hands or with a rolling pin. Make sure to apply potato starch on your hands and the rolling pin. I recommend using a rolling pin because it’s easier to evenly spread out.
Transfer the mochi with parchment paper onto a large baking sheet. Refrigerate for 15 minutes until the mochi is set.
Take out the mochi from the refrigerator and cut out 7-8 circles with the cookie cutter.
Dust off the excess potato starch with a pastry brush. If you find some sticky part, cover the area with potato starch first then dust off. Place a plastic wrap on a plate and then mochi wrapper on top, then lay another layer of plastic wrapper down. Repeat for all wrappers. With leftover mochi dough, roll into a ball and then flatten into a thin layer again and cut out into more circle wrappers (I could make about 12 mochi wrappers).
Now we’re ready to form mochi ice cream balls. On the work surface, place one sheet of plastic wrap with a mochi layer on top. Take out one ice cream ball from the freezer and put it on top of the mochi wrapper. Pinch the four corners of the mochi layer together to wrap the ice cream ball.
When mochi gets sticky, put some potato starch on the sticky area and seal the opening. Quickly cover with the plastic wrap and twist to close. Place each mochi ice cream into a cupcake pan to keep the shape. You will need to work on one mochi ice cream at a time in order to keep the ice cream frozen all times. Put mochi ice cream back into the freezer for a few hours.

For an easy transfer, I use aluminum cup liners to hold Ohagi (Botamochi). You can get it in the bento section at a Japanese grocery store.
To Prepare the Rice
Combine the glutinous rice and rice together in a large bowl and rinse the rice a few times.
Use your fingers to gently wash the rice in a circular motion for 10-15 seconds. Repeat this process 1-2 times. Add water and discard the water. Repeat this process 1-2 times. When the water is almost clear, drain well.
Transfer the drained rice to the rice cooker. Add water (600 ml for my 3 rice cooker cups).
Let soak for 20 minutes and press “start” to cook on regular rice cooking mode.
To Prepare the Toppings/Filling
While the rice is being cooked, prepare the toppings/fillings. Grind sesame seeds with a pestle in a Japanese mortar.
Transfer to a medium bowl and add sugar. Mix well together.
In another medium bowl, combine soybean flour and sugar and mix well together.
Using a small cookie scoop, make red bean paste balls. Each scoop/ball should be 2 teaspoons (0.7 oz or 20 g) of red bean paste.
To Pound Cooked Rice
When the rice is almost finished cooking, make saltwater by combining 1 cup water and 1 tsp salt. Mix well together. This is for soaking the wooden rolling pin or pestle before pounding the glutinous rice.
Once the rice is cooked, remove the rice cooker bowl from the cooker. While it’s hot, start pounding with the wooden pestle or rolling pin.
The wooden rolling pin gets sticky from the glutinous rice. Soak it every few poundings. Stop pounding when the glutinous rice is half mashed/pounded (This is up to your liking. The rice should be mostly mashed but you can still see some rice grains).

Moisten your hands with the saltwater and grab a small amount of pounded glutinous rice (1.4 oz or 40 g). Fatten it to make a round shape.
Once it’s about 2 ½ inch diameter, put one Anko ball in the middle.
Carefully gather up the pounded glutinous rice around the Anko to enclose the filling.
Pinch the seam and form the rice ball into a small oval-shaped ball.
Moisten the plate or tray with saltwater and transfer the oval-shaped rice balls.
To make the soybean flour-coated Ohagi (Botamochi), put the rice ball (with Anko filling) in the soybean flour mix. Rotate a few times to coat well with the mixture and transfer to an aluminum foil liner.
To make the sesame-coated Ohagi (Botamochi), put the rice ball (with Anko filling) in the black sesame mix. Rotate a few times to coat well with the mixture and transfer to an aluminum liner.
To make the Anko-coated Ohagi (Botamochi),
Make a small oval-shaped ball with the pounded glutinous rice (1.4 oz or 40 g).
Using a small cookie scoop, spread 2 scoops of Anko (total of 4 teaspoons, 1.4 oz or 40 g) into a round, flat shape on a piece of plastic wrap.
Put the rice ball on top and evenly coat the Anko around the rice ball.
Pull the plastic wrap and spread the Anko evenly and transfer it to an aluminum liner.
To Serve
When you’re ready to serve Ohagi (Botamochi), reapply the black sesame and soybean flour mixture. Serve them with green tea.
To Store
It’s best to keep them in a cool place and enjoy them as soon as possible (half-day to 12 hours). If it’s too warm to keep at room temperature, I recommend storing them in the refrigerator, but cover the container with a thick towel to protect from cold air. Ideally, they should be kept cool. You can also freeze Ohagi for up to 1 month. When you’re ready to eat, defrost overnight in the refrigerator. To bring back the ideal texture, Ohagi should be reheated gently in the microwave to warm or room temperature for you to enjoy.",en-US,5.0,,Just One Cookbook,120,24 serving(s),,,,,,,,,,,

Center a rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 350ºF (180ºC). For a convection oven, reduce cooking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC).
Combine all the dry ingredients in a stand mixer. With your mixer on low medium speed (with the beater attachment), mix all together.
Slowly add oil and mix until a cohesive dough forms.
The dough should be just enough to hold its shape when you try to roll it into a ball. If they look more like crumbs, add 2-3 tsp (10-15 ml) vegetable oil at a time.
Weigh the dough to make 1-inch (2.5 cm) cookie (0.4 oz, 10 g) or 1 ½-inch (3.8 cm) cookie (0.7 oz, 20 g). Roll the dough into a ball with your palms. Place it on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and repeat until all the dough is used up. You can make a 10-gram ball using a teaspoon measuring spoon.
[optional] If you want to put a piece of almond on the cookie, hold the cookie ball on your palm and gently press the almond into the dough.
Beat the egg yolk in a small bowl. Using a pastry brush, lightly glaze the top of the cookie balls with the egg yolk.

To Make the Batter
In a large mixing bowl, mix eggs and sugar.
Add the honey and milk and whisk all together.
Sift the all purpose flour and baking powder together and add to the egg mixture.
Mix well till well combined and rest the batter for at least 15 minutes (to relax the gluten).
Meanwhile, scoop 2 Tbsp (50 g) of red bean paste and make it into a round disk that fits in the center of the pancake.
To Cook Obanyaki
Slowly heat up the pan to 350ºF (175ºC) over low heat. If you use high heat, some parts get hot and the heat is not even. Take your time to heat up the pan.
Dip a small piece of paper towel in vegetable oil and grease the pan. Then use a clean paper towel to wipe off the excess oil (key for even color on imagawayaki).
When the temperature reaches 350ºF (175ºC) over low heat, pour the batter into a liquid measuring cup for easy pouring. The batter makes about 2¼ cups.
Add the batter half way full and cook for 2 minutes.
Add red bean paste and set timer for 3 minutes. After 1 minute passed (on your 3 minute timer), pour the batter into the empty pan third full and cook for the rest of 2 minutes.
[optional] If you like to use custard cream instead of red bean paste, use an ice cream scooper to drop the custard in the middle of batter.
Using a small metal spatula or skewer, pick up two pancakes with the filling and place on top of the pancakes without filling.
[optional] If you use custard cream for filling, you may want to add a few minutes of cooking time as custard cream is probably chilled prior to the use.
Press down gently and cook for 2 minutes. Loosen up the edges of the pancakes and remove them from the pan.
Let cool on wire rack. Repeat this process until you’re done with the batter.

[Optional] Blind Baking – Please read the blog post first
Preheat the oven to 400ºF (200ºC). For a convection oven, reduce cooking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC). Take out the pie crust from the freezer and thaw for 10 minutes.
When the pie crust has softened a little bit, prick both bottom and sides of the pie crust with a fork, make sure not to poke through. This allows steam to escape and prevents bubbles from forming from the bottom of the crust. Alternatively, you can use pie weights. Bake the pie crust for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from the oven, let it cool until room temperature.
Kabocha Pie
Put 1 cup of water into the pan (I use a wok) and place the steamer basket on top.
With a very firm chef’s knife, cut kabocha in half and scoop out seeds. Cut kabocha into 1 ½ inch (4 cm) cubes.
Place kabocha cubes in a steamer basket and cover with lid. Turn heat to high and steam for 15 minutes.
After 15 min, check if kabocha ready by inserting the skewer into a thick kabocha cube. If it goes through smoothly, then they’re done. Otherwise, keep steaming and check back in 1 minute. Remove the steamer basket from the pan. When the kabocha is cool enough for you to touch, remove the skin with a knife.
Transfer the kabocha to a food processor or blender. Puree kabocha until smooth. Since the kabocha was steamed and contains a good amount of moisture, you don’t need to add any liquid. However, if the kabocha has been sitting out too long and seems dehydrated, add 1 Tbsp water at a time to help it puree. My kabocha yields about 3 cups (675 g). For this recipe, you will need 2 cups (450 g) of pureed kabocha.
If you don’t have a food processor or blender, transfer kabocha to a large bowl and mash with a fine mesh strainer like this to pass through kabocha for finer texture. You can also use a potato masher but it won’t be as refined.
Preheat the oven to 400ºF (200ºC). For a convection oven, reduce cooking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC). Take out the pie crust from the freezer and thaw for 10 minutes.
In a large bowl, combine 2 Tbsp (30 g) unsalted butter and 2 Tbsp (30 g) granulated sugar. Whisk until it’s a creamy consistency.
Add 1 egg yolk and 2 eggs, one at a time and whisk well to combine before adding next one.
Add 2 cups (450 g) pureed kabocha and mix well to combine.
Add ⅓ cup (72 g) brown sugar, 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice, and ½ tsp kosher salt into the bowl and mix all together.
Add 1 Tbsp rum and ¾ cup + 2 Tbsp (200 ml) heavy whipping cream and whisk well.
Pour the filling into the pie crust. Tap the crust on the counter a few times to make sure there is no air gap in the fillings.
Bake at 400ºF (200ºC) for 15 minutes and then reduce oven temperature to 350ºF (180ºC) and bake for 50 minutes, or until the skewer inserted near the center comes out clean. If you pre-baked the pie crust, you might need to shield the edges with foil to avoid the crust becoming too brown and overdone.
Cool on a wire rack for 2 hours before serving.
To Serve
Serve the pie with a big dollop of fresh whipped cream (recipe follows).
To Make Whipped Cream
Place a metal mixing bowl and metal whisk into the freezer for 10 to 15 minutes (If you don’t use an electric mixer, this step helps you to make whipped cream faster). Add 1 cup (240 ml) heavy whipping cream and 2 Tbsp sugar into the mixing bowl. Whisk just until the cream reaches stiff peaks.
Store any unused portion in an airtight container for up to 24 hours. When ready to use, re-whisk for 10 to 15 seconds.

Divide anko into 6 same size balls. Anko gets sticky on your hands, so wash your hands and dry completely each time you make a ball.
Wrap the strawberries with anko. Leave the tip of the strawberry uncovered. Wash your hands and dry completely each time you wrap a strawberry with anko.
In a medium microwave-safe glass bowl, mix shiratamako and sugar with a whisk.
Using a silicone spatula, slowly add water in 3 parts and stir until the mixture has reached a thick consistency. Cover loosely with plastic wrap.
First, microwave 1 minute (for 1000W microwave). Mix well with a wet silicone spatula. The mixture is still whitish and floury.
For the second time, microwave 1 minute again, and mix well with the wet silicone spatula. Now it starts to resemble mochi, but there are still some floury parts.

You will also need 8 4-oz ramekins (4 oz is ½ cup or 120 ml).
Caramel Sauce
Prepare boiling water (you will only need 2 Tbsp) and a cold damp towel (for Step 4).
Combine sugar and water in a saucepan over medium heat. Gently shake the saucepan to evenly distribute sugar and do not touch until the mixture starts to turn golden brown. Gently swirl and tilt the pan again to distribute the mixture to have even color until it becomes amber color (like darker honey color), about 6 minutes.
Immediately remove from heat to a cold damp towel and add 2 Tbsp boiling water. It will create a huge splash so please be careful. You can shield with a lid or wear oven mitts to protect your hands. Stir the saucepan to mix together. This will slightly thin out the caramel sauce and ensure that it doesn’t become too thick in the ramekins.
Briefly dip the ramekins in hot water to warm up. This will prevent the caramel from solidifying (just shake off excess water and no need to dry).
While caramel is still hot, evenly distribute the caramel among the 8 ramekins. Set aside and let the caramel thicken naturally (which is why the caramel will not mix with the custard mixture later).
Custard
In a small bowl, cut 4 gelatin sheets into thin ½ inch (1.3 cm) strips. Add ¼ cup (60 ml) cold water and set aside for 5-6 minutes until the gelatin “blooms” (expands).
If you’re using powder gelatin, combine 3 tsp (10 g) gelatin powder and ¼ cup (60 ml) water and let stand for 1 minute. Then microwave on high for 30-40 seconds and stir. It’s ready to use.
Once gelatin sheets are bloomed, bring 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water to simmer and place the bowl of gelatin mixture over the saucepan (double boiler). Make sure to use a heat resistant bowl, which is larger than the opening of the saucepan. Steam will immediately warm up the glass bowl and start dissolving the gelatin. Turn off the heat and set it aside. If somehow you end up taking a long time to do the following process and the gelatin has set into a solid, you will need to melt it back into a liquid with a double boiler again.
In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and sugar until pale and creamy.
In a medium saucepan, heat 200 ml (roughly 1 cup) milk (keep the rest for later) over medium heat until the milk is warm to the touch.
Slowly add the warm milk, whisking constantly (tempering the egg mixture).
Pour the mixture back into the saucepan. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly (keep an eye on the pot ALL THE TIME; otherwise the mixture will burn on the bottom), until the mixture coats a spoon with a thin film or small bubbles start to form at the edges of the pan, or reaches 160ºF (71ºC).
Add in the gelatin mixture and mix well. Remove from the heat.
Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh strainer into a clean bowl.
Add the rest of the milk (200 ml), heavy whipping cream, and vanilla and whisk all together. We’re adding them at the end to help the mixture cool down.
Divide the custard into the 8 ramekins. Cover with plastic wrap and chill in the fridge overnight or up to 3 days. The caramel on the bottom will become thinner after the moisture from the custard transfers to the caramel.
To serve, run a small sharp knife or toothpick around the edge of each ramekin to loosen the custard. Quickly invert each custard onto a plate. If it doesn’t release right away, gently shake the ramekin a few times to help it out.

Prepare the Fillings
In a small bowl, combine 100 g white bean paste (Shiroan) with 2 g matcha (green tea powder).
Using a small spatula or spoon, blend the paste and matcha until the mixture is homogeneous.
Cover the bowl of matcha paste and the other bowl of 100 g white bean paste with plastic wrap. Freeze the bowls of paste for 30 minutes (or refrigerate for 60 minutes) to firm up the texture.
After 30-60 minutes, take out the bowls.
We'll start with the white bean paste first by dividing it into thirds. Wet your hands with water.
Take ⅓ of the paste into your hands and roll into a ball. Continue with the rest.
Transfer to a plate. Don’t worry if they are not perfectly round.
Now we'll work on the matcha paste by dividing into thirds. Wet your hands with water and take ⅓ of the paste into your hands.
Roll each third into a ball. Refrigerate until ready to use.
Make Mochi and Assemble
First, we make white mochi with matcha filling. In a bowl, combine 50 g Shiratamako and 25 g sugar and whisk well.
Add 90 g water and whisk well until there is no lump.
Cover the bowl with a paper towel and microwave for 1 minute (my microwave is 1200W). If you do not have a microwave, you can steam the mixture. Please see the Daifuku recipe and video for the tutorial.
Wet your silicone spatula with water.
Mix the mochi dough so that it will be cooked evenly.
Cover and microwave for an additional 30 seconds (or more/less depends on your microwave strength). The cooked mochi dough will look opaque.
Spread the potato starch or corn starch well on a baking sheet. Remember, mochi dough will stick if the surface is not covered with starch. Transfer the mochi dough on top of the starch.
Sprinkle potato starch on top of the mochi dough and on your hands. Your hands must be well coated; otherwise, they will be very sticky.
Use a dough scraper, divide the mochi dough into equal thirds.
If one is bigger than the other, cut off the edge and add to the center of the smaller dough. Flatten the dough into a circle shape.
Place the matcha paste ball in the center of the dough. Bring all four corners of the dough over the ball.
Bring the rest of the edges to the top.
Pinch the seam line by pulling the mochi dough.
If the dough is too sticky, tap the seam line with potato starch. If the dough is covered with too much potato starch, dust it off and pull the dough at the seam so the sticky surface appears and you can seal the seam.
Once the seam is tightly closed, flip the mochi so the seam line is on the bottom. Twist the mochi a few times on your palm to reshape until even thickness.
Repeat the same for the next 2 mochi dough.
Now, we make the green tea mochi with white bean filling. In a bowl, combine 50 g Shiratamako and 25 g sugar and whisk well.
Add 2 g matcha into the mixture and whisk well.
Add 90 g water and whisk well until there is no lump.

Wet your silicone spatula with water. Mix the mochi dough so that it will be cooked evenly.
Cover and microwave for an additional 30 seconds (or more/less depends on your microwave strength). The cooked mochi dough will look opaque.
Spread the potato starch or cornstarch generously on a baking sheet. Remember, mochi dough will stick if the surface is not covered by the potato starch. Transfer the mochi dough on top of the starch. Sprinkle more starch on top of the mochi dough and on your hands. Your hands must be well coated; otherwise, they will be very sticky.
Use a dough scraper, divide the mochi dough into equal thirds. If one is bigger than the other, cut off the edge and add to the center of the smaller dough.
Flatten the dough into a circle shape.
Place the white bean paste ball in the center of the dough. Bring all four corners of the dough over the ball.
Then bring the rest of the edges to the top and pinch the seam line by pulling the mochi dough. If the dough is too sticky, tap the seam line with potato starch.

To Make Soy Sauce Caramel
You can double the recipe but do not increase beyond that because it’s not easy to melt the sugar properly. In a small saucepan, heat ½ cup sugar over medium heat, stirring constantly with a whisk, silicone spatula, or wooden spoon.
Sugar will form clumps and eventually melt into a thick brown, amber-colored liquid as you continue to stir. Careful not to burn from the splatter.
Once sugar is completely melted, immediately add 3 Tbsp butter. The caramel will bubble rapidly so take extra cautions not to burn yourself from the splatter.
Stir the butter into the caramel until it is completely melted. If you notice the butter separating or if the sugar clumped up, remove from heat and vigorously whisk to combine. Keep whisking until it comes back together, even if it takes 3-4 minutes. It will eventually get there. Just keep whisking. Return to heat when it’s combined again.
Very slowly drizzle in ¼ cup of heavy cream while stirring. Since the heavy cream is colder than the caramel, the mixture will rapidly bubble when added. It will rise in the pan as it boils.
Turn off and remove from the heat and stir in 2 Tbsp soy sauce.
Allow it to cool down slightly before use. Caramel thickens as it cools.
After the caramel cools down, pour it into a glass jar or container. Refrigerate for up to 1 month and freezer for up to 3 months. The caramel solidifies as it cools, but you can reheat in the microwave or on the stove so it becomes liquid again. For the frozen caramel, thaw in the refrigerator or at room temperature, then warm up before using.
To Make Vanilla Ice Cream Mixture
Cut the gelatin sheet into 1-inch (2.5 cm) pieces and add ¼ cup water to let the gelatin bloom for 10 minutes.
In a medium saucepan, add 2 cups heavy (whipping) cream and 1 cup whole milk.
Whisk together and bring it to almost simmering over medium-low heat until small bubbles appear along the edges (but don’t let it boil), about 8-10 minutes. If you have a cooking thermometer, it should be 181 °F or 83 °C.
In a large bowl, combine sugar and egg yolks (if you are using gelatin powder, add now).
Whisk together till combine.
Add a quarter of the milk mixture from the pot into the bowl, while constantly whisking (to prevent the eggs from cooking).
Then repeat with another quarter of the mixture, while stirring with the plastic spatula.
Finally, pour everything in the bowl and whisk together. Then pour back the mixture into the pot.
Drain the water from the gelatin sheet and add it to the mixture.
Return the pot to the stove and heat on medium-low, stirring constantly to prevent the mixture from sticking to the bottom of the pot.
Without allowing it to boil, heat for 8-10 minutes, or until the mixture thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon. The cooking thermometer should reach 160 ºF or 71 °C to pasteurize the eggs. Turn heat off and pour the mixture through a fine-mesh strainer into a 4 cup measuring cup or a medium bowl.
Add the vanilla and stir to combine.
Prepare a large bowl with ice cubes, and set the measuring cup (or the medium bowl) inside. Stir the mixture occasionally to help cool faster. Once cool (should take about 30 minutes), cover with plastic wrap and place in refrigerator overnight or at least 4 hours.
To Churn Ice Cream
On the following day (or after 4 hours), set up your ice cream maker according to the instructions. My Cuisinart ice cream maker just broke so I borrowed my friend’s fancy ice cream maker that does not require freezing the bowl in advance. However, many home ice cream freezers have bowls that need to be frozen ahead of time. Don’t skimp on this step! A bowl that isn’t completely frozen will take longer to freeze your ice cream and impact the finished product. If you make homemade ice cream on a regular basis, store your bowl in the freezer once it is clean. It will always be ready for your next batch of ice cream.
Pour the mixture into the ice cream machine. Make sure not to fill it more than about ⅔ of the way up.
Start churning. Churning ice cream incorporates air into the finished product while it freezes, so you will need some extra room in your freezer bowl.
The mixture has been thicker and creamier, about 25-30 minutes.
Lift up the paddle and remove the ice cream with a (mini) silicone spatula into the ice cream maker bowl.
Transfer half the ice cream into an airtight glass container (ideally a square or rectangular shape) and flatten the top with the silicone spatula.
Drizzle generous amount of soy sauce caramel on top.
Add the rest of the ice cream and flatten it with the silicone spatula.
Drizzle more caramel sauce on top. Save some for drizzling when serving.
Cover the lid and put it in the freezer. Set freezer temperature to the coldest setting, so the ice cream freezes faster. Optional: Lay plastic wrap directly on top of ice cream and press down gently to prevent ice crystals from forming on top of the ice cream.
To Serve
Take the ice cream out of the freezer 5-10 minutes before serving, so it becomes soft enough to scoop. Drizzle extra Soy Sauce Caramel on top if you like.",en-US,5.0,,Just One Cookbook,1595,1 serving(s),,,,,,,,,,,

See the notes below))"", '⅔ cup water', '1 slice kabocha (squash/pumpkin) ((you will need 2 tsp mashed kabocha))']","Gather all the ingredients. Kabocha is very hard to cut. If you have trouble, see my tutorial on How to Cut Kabocha Squash. Bring a big pot of water to boil dango on low heat.
To Prepare Kabocha Squash
Steam a thin slice of Kabocha squash for 13-15 minutes (depending on thickness, cooking time varies).
When a skewer can go through, it’s done. Transfer to a plate or tray. With a spoon, scrape off the flesh. You will need 2 tsp mashed kabocha and set aside.
To Make Dango
Add dangoko in a bowl. Stir in water a little bit a time while mixing with chopsticks. Please note: it is possible that you may need less or more water depending on where you live. I live in a dry climate, so I may use more water than you. The dangoko starts to stick together and eventually it becomes clumps.
Using your hand, combine into one ball. Knead until the dough becomes smooth. The texture is like squeezing an ""earlobe"" (that’s how we describe the tenderness for this type of mochi in Japanese).
Make the dough into a ball. Divide the dough into 8 equal pieces. Then divide each piece into 2 balls. Each ball should be 20 grams. You may have some extra dough, but that’s okay.
To make 2 yellow balls, prepare 30 gram of dough and mix in 2 tsp mashed kabocha.
Combine the kabocha and dough really well. Depending on kabocha, it may contain more moisture. If the dough gets too wet, mix in more Dangoko so the dough will be firmer and easy to make into a ball. If the yellow color is not strong, you can add more mashed kabocha, but you also need to add in more flour to firm up.
You will need 40 grams of yellow dough, and divide into two 20 gram yellow balls, just like the rest of white balls.
Shape into a nice smooth round ball. If the dough is cracking or has some wrinkle, tap your finger in water and apply the small amount of water on the cracked area to smooth out. I have 15 white balls and 2 yellow balls.
Once the water in the pot is boiling, gently drop in each ball into the pot with a continuous motion. We want to cook them all at once, but also keeping them in good shapes. Stir the balls occasionally so they don’t stick on the bottom of the pot.
Dango will stay on the bottom first but once they are cooked, they will float. Then cook an additional 1-2 minute. Transfer them into iced water.
Once the dango is cooled, drain well and transfer to a tray (if you wet the tray, the dumplings won’t stick).
In the boiling water, add the yellow balls. Once floating, transfer to iced water to let cool. Drain and transfer to the tray.
To Arrange Tsukimi Dango
Place 15 dango into a pyramid shape on a plate or tray. From bottom to top, you put 9, 4, and 2 balls.
To Eat Tsukimi Dango
After displaying Tsukimi Dango for hours or a day, the dumplings may have become hard to eat. Then you can cut and toast it in the oven toaster or frying pan. Then coat the dango with sweet soy glaze (mitarashi sauce) following this recipe.",en-US,4.25,,Just One Cookbook,60,15 serving(s),,,,,,,,,,,

Before we start
Make sure the eggs and butter are at room temperature. Sift the cake flour at least twice.
Place the cake pan on top of parchment paper, trace around the pan and cut out the circle. Grease one side of the parchment paper and also both the bottom and sides of the cake pan with butter. Then fit the parchment paper in the cake pan. (I avoid parchment paper on the side because sometimes it pulls the batter and affects the final result of the cake).
Preheat oven to 350ºF (180ºC). For a convection oven, reduce cooking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC). It’s always better to preheat longer, preferably 15-20 minutes extra. Tip: You preheat the oven so that all the surfaces inside your oven (walls, floor, door, racks) are the desired cooking temperature, which makes for more even temperatures throughout the oven and you won’t lose as much heat when you open the door for a few seconds. Depending on your oven, regular preheating might take 10 to 20 minutes.
Prepare a double boiler. If you have never done this before, please see Notes section below. Turn on the stove’s heat to high and bring the water in the saucepan (Pot A) to a rapid boil. When boiling, reduce heat to maintain a steady simmer. Put the 40g (3 Tbsp) of butter in the small bowl (Bowl #1) and set over the saucepan. Let the butter melt gently.
Once the butter is melted, remove the bowl from the saucepan. Then add 30 ml (2 Tbsp) whole milk and whisk to combine. Set aside to keep it around 104ºF (40ºC).
For the sponge cake
In the stand mixer bowl (Bowl #2), add 4 eggs and break the egg yolks and whites.
Add 120 g (½ cup + 2 Tbsp) sugar and whisk to combine.
In the large pot (Pot B), bring about 2 inches of water to 140ºF or 60ºC and maintain the temperature. Then set the stand mixer bowl (Bowl #2) directly in the pot and whisk constantly so the eggs don’t become scrambled eggs. This method is called bain marie (or water bath), where the bowl of food is set directly in a larger container of hot or simmering water. You can also use the double boiler method, where you set the egg mixture bowl (Bowl #2) over the Pot B. The bowl doesn’t touch the simmering water of the pot. In both cases, the water tempers the heat to permit gentle, even cooking.
Whisk until the temperature of the egg mixture reaches 104ºF (40ºC). Remove Bowl #2 from Pot B and set it up on the stand mixer with the whisk attachment.
Whisk on high speed (level 10) until the mixture is fluffy, for about 2 minutes. The batter should be loose yet thick and glossy.
When the batter is pale and fluffy and tripled in volume, slow down to low speed (level 4) for several seconds. Stop and lift up some of the mixture and fold it in, and if the batter stays on top of the mixture, that’s “ribbon stage” (see Notes). Remove from the stand mixer.
Add half of the flour. Using the whisk, fold gently but thoroughly. Do this by rotating your bowl slowly, and simultaneously moving your whisk in a downward-then-over motion.
Add the rest of the flour and fold gently to make sure all the flour is incorporated quickly so your mixture doesn’t deflate.
Take out 1 (spatula) scoop of the batter from the bowl and add to the butter & milk mixture.
Mix very well. We incorporate butter into batter first because fat in butter will deflate the batter if we add the butter directly.
Add the mixture back to the batter by pouring over the silicon spatula. This prevents the mixture from deflating the batter and helps disperse the mixture. Gently fold in. When you lift the spatula, the batter should fold down like ribbon.
Pour the batter into the center of the cake pan, from right above the cake pan. You want to avoid introducing extra air into the batter at this point. Collect the leftover batter in the bowl and pour around the edges of the cake pan, not the center.
Drop the cake pan on the counter to release air bubbles in the batter.
In the preheated oven, bake at 350ºF (180ºC) for 20-25 minutes. Check if the sponge cake is done by inserting a skewer in the middle and comes out clean. Meanwhile, move on to the cake assemble prepping stage.
As soon as you take out the cake pan from the oven, drop it on the counter to give shock to the cake (so it stops shrinking). Separate the cake from the pan by running a sharp knife or offset spatula around the pan.
Take the cake out of the pan by placing the wire rack on top and flipping it over.
Immediately remove the parchment paper.
Place another wire rack on top and flip it back. The top of the cake is now facing up.
Cover the cake with a damp towel until cooled (to keep moisture in the cake). Make sure the towel is thin (not heavy) and squeeze the water out VERY tightly so that it’s damp, not wet. I use IKEA’s thin dish towel. If you keep the sponge cake for later use, wrap with plastic wrap and keep it in the fridge (See Notes).
Preparation for cake assembly (while the cake is baking)
Divide the strawberries into 2 groups, for decoration and for filling. Keep the beautiful, same-sized strawberries for the decoration. Remove the husk and clean the strawberries with damp paper towel (do not wash, as we don’t want strawberries to have moisture and become moldy). Slice off the core for all the strawberries.
For the strawberries that we use for topping, cut in half. For the strawberries that we use for filling, slice them into ¼ inch (5 mm) slices.
To make syrup, in a small bowl (Bowl #3), combine 30 ml (2 Tbsp) water, 38 g (3 Tbsp) sugar, 1 Tbsp. liquor, and microwave for 1 minute to dissolve the sugar.
For whipping cream (while cake is cooling)
Prepare ice bath by placing ice cubes and water in a large bowl (Bowl #4). Place a clean and dry mixing bowl (Bowl #2) over and add 473 ml (1 Pint) heavy cream and 38 g (3 Tbsp) sugar to keep cool.
Once cooled, transfer the mixing bowl to the stand mixer and whisk on high speed. The cream will become thicker and smooth. When you lift the whisk out of the cream while it’s still liquid, but holds it shape as it drops, then it’s ready. Remove the bowl from the stand mixer and put it back in the ice bath.
The cake assembly
With a serrated knife, slice the middle of the cake horizontally into half. Now you have 2 layers (top and bottom).
Place the bottom of the cake on the cake circle. Brush the syrup on top and the sides of the bottom layer. This will keep the sponge cake stay moist.
Start to whisk the cream at one location by the edge of the bowl instead of whisking the entire cream. We will be making the whipped cream as we need. With this approach, we can also control the hardness of the cream.
When the cream reaches “soft peaks”, take out the cream and transfer to the bottom of the cake. Soft peaks means when you lift the whisk, the cream will hold its line but the top peaks will be soft and after a second or two will fall back on itself.
Spread the whipped cream evenly. If the whipped cream is not enough, whip more and add onto the cake.
Place the strawberries on top of the whipped cream as you see in the pictures. Keep the center area open by not covering with strawberries. This will be easier to cut the cake into slices.
Whip the cream again at the edge of the bowl.
Transfer the whipped cream to the top of the strawberry layer. Spread just enough cream to cover the strawberries, do not put too much.
Place the top layer of the sponge cake. Brush the syrup on the top and sides of the sponge cake.
Whip more cream and place on the top.
Place the tip of the offset spatula in the center at 30 degree angle, turn cake turntable toward you to create a smooth top. Lightly cover the sides of the cake with thin layer of the cream.
Now add more cream to the side little by little. Place the offset spatula at 90 degree angle and push the turning table away from you.
Remove the excess cream from the cake and put back into the bowl.
For cake decoration
For a basic decoration, I use Wilton 2A decoration tip. Put the tip in the piping bag and cut off the tip so the metal will show from the bag. Fold the top half of the bag outward as you see in the picture (over the hands).
Whip the cream to “stiff peaks”. When you lift the whisk, the peaks will hold firm. Put the cream into the piping bag. Once you fill out the bag half way, lift the bag and push the cream down to the tip.
Squeeze the pipe to test to make sure the cream comes out smoothly. When you’re ready, hold the piping bag at 90 degree angle and squeeze about 1 inch diameter of whipped cream around the edge of the cake. This will be the base for the strawberries.
Decorate and place the strawberries sideways on top of the whipped cream. Then squeeze more whipped cream in between strawberries, dropping small whipped cream all around. Place blueberries between the whipped cream dollops. Place the small mint leaves in some area to add colors.

In a large bowl, combine 1 large egg and ⅓ cup black sugar, and whisk together until sugar has dissolved.
Add 1 tsp oil and whisk together.
Sift 1 cup cake flour, 1 tsp baking powder, and ⅛ tsp kosher salt over the egg and sugar mixture.
Using a silicone spatula, start to combine the dry and wet ingredients. If the dough is too wet, you can add extra flour. Moisture in the air effects, so you have to decide how your dough is like. If you feel that it’s too soft and wet, add more flour 1 Tbsp at a time. The consistency is similar to cookie dough, but slightly softer. Let the dough rest for an hour.
Bring the oil in the deep fryer to 300-320ºF (150-160ºC) over medium-low heat. In order to cook inside the dough, we deep fry at low temperature. For a medium saucepan, you will need about 3 cups of oil. You can use less oil, but you will need to rotate the balls often as they won’t be covered by oil.
Prepare some oil (for rolling the dough) in a small bowl and rub it on your palms which will prevent the dough from sticking to your hands.
When the oil in the deep fryer reaches 300-320ºF (150-160ºC), scoop the dough with a cookie scooper and roll into a ball. To achieve the same portion size for whatever you're making, a cookie scooper is a great tool to have. The size should be slightly bigger than 1 inch (should be around 3 cm). We say the size should be Ping-Pong ball size (if that helps).
As soon as you are done with rolling, start putting the dough balls into the oil. They will expand so do not put too many.
Once the dough balls are cooked through, they start to float. They rotate themselves, but you can help them rotate to achieve even coloring.
When golden brown, about 7-8 minutes of deep frying, pick them up and drain excess oil on a paper towel or wire rack. Let cool for 5 minutes and enjoy!

Sift 1 ½ Tbsp green tea powder into a medium bowl. If you have a Chasen (bamboo tea whisk), you can whisk the sieve so there will be no green tea powder left inside. Set aside.
If you are using gelatin sheets, cut 2 gelatin sheets into thin ½ inch (1.3 cm) strips in a medium bowl. Please make sure to use a heat resistant bowl as we will need to melt the gelatin with a double boiler (Step 2). If you are using gelatin powder, put 5 g gelatin powder in a medium bowl. Once the gelatin sheet/powder is in the bowl, pour 2 Tbsp hot water and mix.
In a small saucepan, bring roughly ½ cup of water to simmer and place the bowl of gelatin mixture over the saucepan. The steam will immediately warm up the glass bowl and start dissolving the gelatin. Once dissolved, remove from the heat and set aside.
Pour 1 ¼ cup (300 ml) whole milk in a small saucepan and bring it to almost boil. When you see the small bubbles around the edge of the saucepan, turn off the heat.
Add ¼ cup (4 Tbsp, 50 g) granulated sugar and whisk well to dissolve the sugar.
Add 3 Tbsp of milk mixture into the green tea powder. Whisk with Chasen (or small whisk) until the mixture is silky smooth and you don’t see any lumps of dry green tea powder left (very important!).
Pour the green tea mixture into the milk mixture and whisk all together. If you dissolved all the powder at previous step, this step should be very easy and matcha powder should blend very well and easily.
Add the gelatin liquid into the green tea mixture and whisk well.
Put 3 Tbsp (40 g) anko (red bean paste) in a medium bowl and pour some of green tea mixture into red bean paste. Combine well. The green tea mixture will loosen up the red bean paste. Divide the red bean & green tea mixture into each serving cup.

Finely chop ⅓-½ cup (40-60 g) raw walnuts and set aside.
Place the almonds in a single layer on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Almonds should be over an area measuring about 10"" x 7"" (25 x 18 cm). Optionally you could bake the almonds in the preheated oven at 300ºF (150ºC) for 10-15 minutes to bring out more flavors.
In a heavy 2-quart saucepan, add 1 cup (227 g) unsalted butter, 1 cup (200 g) granulated sugar, ¼ tsp kosher salt, and ½ tsp vanilla extract.
Cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally while with a clean, dry wooden spoon until butter is melted.
Once the butter is melted, set the timer for 5 minutes and continue cooking and stirring constantly until the toffee is the color of whole raw almonds. Depends on your heat, you will be stirring from 5 to 7 minutes (workout time!). If you use lower heat, it could take up to 10 minutes (hence I recommend a long wooden spoon so you can use stronger heat).
When the candy is color of raw almonds, turn off the heat.
Immediately pour the toffee over almonds, covering all nuts and smoothing into an even layer. Do not scrape the pan. Keep the pot for delicious hot caramel milk.
Melt 1 cup (170 g) semi-sweet or bittersweet chocolate chips over a double boiler until the chocolate is soft enough to stir smoothly. Alternatively, you can melt the chocolate in the microwave for about 1 to 1.5 minute to start with. Remove from the microwave and stir. Repeat heating at shorter intervals, 15 to 20 seconds, stirring in between, until the chocolate is completely melted and has a smooth consistency.
Spread the chocolate over cooled toffee.
Sprinkle with walnuts and let cool until chocolate is firm, about 2 hours (or once the toffee is cool down, refrigerate for 20 minutes to speed up the process).

I've used a kitchen scale to measure my flours. Prepare 24 sheets of 4” x 4” (10 x 10 cm) parchment paper.
Melt the butter in the microwave or in a saucepan over the stove and let cool slightly. Crack 2 eggs in a bowl and beat them with a whisk. Set aside.
In the bowl of a stand mixer (or a large mixing bowl), combine whole milk (110ºF or 43ºC - slightly warmer than body temperature) and instant yeast, and then add ½ tsp sugar from the 50 g (¼ cup) sugar you prepared. Whisk the mixture well. Set aside for 5-10 minutes. NOTE: If you wonder why I hydrated instant yeast (even though it’s not Active Dry Yeast), please read the post.
Prepare a large mixing bowl and sift the tapioca flour and all-purpose flour through a fine-mesh sieve. Whisk to combine.
Set the stand mixer with a flat beater attachment. Add the rest of the sugar and beaten egg to the milk mixture.
Add the melted butter and vanilla.
Beat on low speed for 1 minute until combined (Or, stir with a wooden spoon).
Add roughly 2 cups flour mixture and beat on low speed until well combined.
With the stand mixer running on low speed, add the remaining flour mixture one scoop at a time and salt. Set aside the mixing bowl that flours were in for the next step. The dough mixture has thickened.
Now change to medium-high speed (Speed 6) and beat for 3-4 minutes, or until smooth and elastic. Note that this is a sticky dough, so do not add additional flours. Tip: Kneading develops the structure of the dough by folding and stretching strands of gluten. Hand Kneading: Because of the nature of this dough, it’s hard to knead the dough by hand. You can add 1-2 tablespoons of flour if it’s too wet to handle, but do not add any more flour than that. Hand-knead for 5-6 minutes.
Now bring back the large mixing bowl (that had flours in it earlier). Add a little bit of oil and grease it with a paper towel.
When you remove the flat beater from the stand mixer, you can see the stretchy, sticky dough.
Using the pastry card, transfer the dough into the greased bowl. Try to scrape down the dough from the sides, collect the dough into one big mass, then gently scrape it down to the greased bowl. The key here is to make sure the surface of the dough is mostly smooth (so that it will rise nicely). Loosely cover the bowl with plastic wrap (or a shower cap) and place it in a warm environment to rise until doubled, about 70-80 minutes. I use my “Proof” oven setting at 100ºF (38ºC). I put warm/hot water (away from the dough) to keep the inside of the oven moist. Tip: Make sure the proof temperature is not too high. If the dough gets too warm, it will ferment too quickly (or over ferment) and impair the flavor.
After 70-80 minutes, pour the oil into the Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot (See Notes for the amount of oil). If you have a thermometer, set up. I used Thermowork’s ChefAlarm. A probe clip attaches the probe right to the side of the dutch oven holding it securely in place, keeping it from flopping it around. Set your alarm thermometer to 325ºF (168ºC) as the lowest and 350ºF (177ºC) as the highest.
In a medium bowl, combine all the glaze ingredients except for matcha powder. Whisk really well to make sure there are no lumps of confectioners’ sugar. Keep the matcha powder on the side for now.
The picture below shows the dough doubled in size, after 75 minutes of proofing.
Prepare 1-2 Tbsp of all-purpose flour and put it at the corner of your work surface. Lightly flour the work surface and your hands.
Using the pastry card, remove the dough from the bowl and transfer to the lightly floured surface. Sprinkle some flour on top of the dough and press the dough down with your hands to release any air bubbles.
With the pastry card, shape the dough into a rough log shape and cut it in half.
Shape the half into a ball and cover with plastic wrap. Cut the other half into 4 pieces, and roll them into 4 balls. Keep 3 dough balls under the plastic wrap.
Each dough balls will make roughly 3 Pon de Ring donuts. Using the pastry card, cut the dough into small balls. Each ball size should be ½ - ¾ inches (1.5 cm) in length and width. Or if you have a digital kitchen scale, each ball should be 5 grams.
Roll the ball between your hands, but try not to spend too much time. Over-kneaded dough often ends up with hard crust and a dense, dry interior. Since the dough is very sticky, this pastry card is very helpful.
Use the pastry card to transfer each ball to a 4” x 4” parchment paper. You will need 8 balls to make a Pon de Ring shape.
The total weight of Pon de Ring should be roughly 40 grams (5 g each ball).
Continue with the rest of the dough.
To make sure the balls won’t separate in the hot oil, use a pastry brush to dab water on the dough where balls attach to neighboring ones. Cover the donuts with a damp paper towel or light cloth (make sure it’s not heavy) and allow to rest for 15-20 minutes. Continue with the rest of the dough. If you are taking a very long time, it’s very helpful to work with a partner so the dough won’t be over-proofed.
When you’re finishing up with the last batch of dough, start heating the oil in the Dutch oven to 350ºF (177ºC). Prepare the first baking sheet lined with a paper towel and a second baking sheet lined with parchment paper and put a wire rack on top.
Using your hands or fine-mesh skimmer (a kind that has a flat mesh), submerge the donut into the oil.
Let go of the donut and set the timer for 1 minute 15 seconds for the first side. Tip: Only add enough donuts for a 5-10 degree drop in temperature (I only add 2 donuts per batch). If the oil cools down too much, the donuts won’t fry properly.
When the 1 minute 15 seconds timer beeps, flip the donuts quickly using chopsticks or tongs. Fry the second side for 45 seconds.
When the 45-second timer beeps, scoop up the donut and drain well. Then transfer to the paper towel to drain excess oil. Repeat with remaining donuts, then turn off the heat.
While the donuts are still hot, dip each donut into the glaze, making sure to coat well.
Place it onto the prepared rack to allow excess glaze to drip down. The glaze will set and harden on the donuts after 30 minutes.
After making 12 glazed donuts, you can add the matcha to the leftover glaze. Whisk really well to combine.
Dip each donut into the matcha glaze, making sure to coat well. Place it onto the rack to allow excess glaze to drip down. The glaze will set and harden on the donuts after 30 minutes
Just like any other deep-fried foods, it’s best to eat the donuts when they are warm. Enjoy!

Preheat the oven to 375ºF (190ºC). For a convection oven, reduce cooking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC).
Wash the sweet potatoes carefully (the skin is edible and very nutritious) under running water. Pat dry with paper towel.
Wrap each sweet potato with a sheet of aluminum foil. Poke a few holes with a skewer (for steam to escape).
Put the sweet potatoes in the oven and bake for 50-60 minutes, or until the inserted skewer goes through all the way.
Carefully open the aluminum foil and cut the sweet potato in half lengthwise. Make sure not to tear the skin.
While it’s hot, using a spoon, scoop out the flesh leaving a 5 mm (¼ inch) wall around the edges to create a shell. We use the shells to stuff the sweet potato puree later on, so be careful not to break the wall. You will only use 5 best-looking shells out of 6.
Transfer the sweet potato flesh onto the fine-mesh sieve and strain the flesh by pressing it with a wooden spatula. Alternatively, you can put the flesh in a food processor and make a puree (you may need to add a tiny bit of water if the sweet potato flesh is too dense).
Continue with the rest of the sweet potatoes. Collect the strained pureed sweet potato in a bowl.
In a medium saucepan, heat 2 Tbsp unsalted butter over medium-low heat. Once the butter is completely melted, add the pureed sweet potato.
Add 5 Tbsp sugar and mix well together.
Then add egg yolks one at a time and quickly incorporate into the sweet potato mixture so the egg doesn’t become scrambled egg. Keep stirring.
Gradually add ⅓ cup heavy cream, stirring continuously, and combine well with the mixture.
Add ½ tsp vanilla extract and mix until the mixture is smooth and creamy. If the mixture turns into a big lump and not the silky texture, you can add more melted butter and/or heavy cream to loosen up. Turn off the heat.
Scoop the mixture into the sweet potato shells. I use a cookie dough scooper to make the job easier (this is great for portion control, too!).
Using a offset spatula (or a silicone spatula), smooth out the surface of the filling, creating a gentle slope in the center of the sweet potatoes.
Place the sweet potato shells on a baking sheet lined with a sheet of parchment paper.
In a small bowl, whisk 1 egg yolk and brush the egg wash on the sweet potato mixture.
Sprinkle black sesame seeds on the center of each sweet potato.
Position the rack in the middle of the oven. Broil medium (500ºF/250ºC) for 3-4 minutes, or until the top starts to brown a little bit.

Preheat the oven to 340ºF (170ºC). For a convection oven, reduce cooking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC0. You will also need a 17cm (7"") chiffon cake pan. If you have a different size chiffon cake pan, please read this post. Make sure you use the correct chiffon cake pan. The best types are the aluminum ones with a removable base (Do not use non-stick bakeware for chiffon cake – it will not work). Do not grease the mold because the cake needs to cling on the sides and center of the pan for support as it rises or it will collapse.
Put 2 tsp Earl Grey loose tea leaves in a food processor (I used a Nutribullet here) and grind them to fine powder. Alternatively, you can use a mortar and pestle to grind tea leaves, or put tea leaves in a bag and crush them.
Put 1 Tbsp. Earl Grey loose tea leaves in a fine sieve over a bowl and pour 6 Tbsp (90 ml) of hot water to seep a strong tea. After cooling down, remove the tea leaves and use ONLY 4 Tbsp (60 ml) Earl Grey tea and set aside.
Separate 3 eggs to whites and yolks. Keep the egg whites in the refrigerator (or freezer) until you're ready to use.
In a large bowl, whisk 3 egg yolks and roughly ⅓ of 85 g sugar.
Add 3 Tbsp vegetable oil, 4 Tbsp tea, and whisk all together until combined.
Add the powdered Earl Grey tea in the egg mixture and mix well.
Sift 75 g cake flour and 1 tsp baking powder into the egg mixture in 3 increments. Whisk until totally incorporated and make sure there are no lumps.
Using a stand mixer (make sure there is no trace of water or oil), whip the chilled egg whites on medium-low sped (speed 4) till opaque, foamy and bubbly. If you put the egg whites in the freezer, the surface and edges may be frozen already, but that's okay. You can add half-frozen egg whites into the bowl. Add ⅓ of the remaining sugar and continue whipping. After 30 seconds or so, increase the stand mixer speed to high (speed 10) and add the remaining sugar slowly in small increments. It takes about 2-3 minutes until stiff peaks form (from the moment you switched to speed 10, but this is just a rough guide and it will vary based on stand mixers.). To check on stiff peaks, pull up your whisk and see if the egg whites go straight up (stiff peak) and just the tip is soft enough that it folds over, like taking a bow.
Using a spatula, fold in ⅓ of the egg whites to the batter until the mixture is homogeneous.
Fold in the rest of egg whites in 2-3 increments and mix gently until the mixture is homogeneous.
Pour the batter into the ungreased 17 cm (7”) chiffon cake pan in same location to prevent from foaming more bubbles. To remove or prevent air pockets before baking, run a skewer (chopstick, knife or spatula) through the batter and then drop gently a few times.
Bake in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean and the top of the cake springs back when gently pressed. If the top gets burn too quickly, cover the top loosely with aluminum foil.
The cake must be cooled upside down in its pan so that it stretch down instead of collapsing. Stick the cake pan on a tall heavy bottle or invert the cake pan onto a cooling rack (if you use angel food cake pan). Let it cool completely. To extract the cake, run a thin sharp knife or thin offset spatula around both the outer and inner edge of the cake and then tap the cake out onto a serving plate.

Steam Kabocha in Instant Pot
Quickly rinse the kabocha under water and remove the seeds with a spoon.
Cut kabocha into wedges and then 2 inch pieces.
Fill the Instant Pot with 1 cup water and set a steamer basket inside.
Put the kabocha in a single layer.
Close the lid and set HIGH pressure for 2 minutes.
Make sure the steam release handle points at “sealing” and not “venting”. The float valve goes up when pressurized.
Make Caramel Sauce
While you’re waiting for Kabocha to finish (Keep in mind that after pressure cooking, you only let the pressure release naturally for 10 minutes), we can make the caramel sauce. Boil water in a kettle or saucepan and set aside (you will only need 2 Tbsp hot water). Put 4 Tbsp sugar and 1 Tbsp water in a small saucepan.
Gently shake the saucepan to evenly distribute sugar and do not touch until the mixture starts to turn golden brown. Gently shake the pan again to distribute the mixture to have even color.
When the caramel reaches amber color (I like a slightly darker color – which has a milder bitter), turn off the heat and quickly add 2 Tbsp hot water to loosen it. The caramel will splash, so use a lid to protect yourself from getting caramel splatter.
Swirl the saucepan to make even mixture and pour the caramel into 4 ramekins. Allow the caramel sauce to cool.
Make Kabocha Puree
When it’s finished cooking, the Instant Pot will switch automatically to the “Keep Warm” mode. Let the pressure release naturally for 10 minutes and then proceed with quick release (DO NOT EXCEED. I recommend to set a timer.) by turning the steam release handle to the “venting” position to let steam out until the float valve drops down. Hold a kitchen towel and do not place your hand or face over steam release valve. The steam should be left only a little bit after 10 minutes of natural release.
Open the lid and remove the steam rack from the Instant Pot.
Use a knife or spoon to remove the flesh. Discard the kabocha skin (but it’s edible!).
Use a flour sifter or fine mesh sieve (Uragoshiki in Japanese) or a food processor. Set the fine mesh sieve over a sheet of parchment paper and press the steamed kabocha into the mesh with a wooden spatula. Once it’s all done, flip the mesh sieve and take out the pureed kabocha onto the parchment paper. If you’re using a food processor, process the kabocha into a puree.
Measure ½ cup (120 g) kabocha puree from the pile. With almost 1 lb kabocha, you will have enough to make 4 ramekins, but you may not have enough puree for another batch. It’s hard to predict the real weight of kabocha with seeds included, so please adjust accordingly. You can also save the puree for up to 3 days in the fridge. I sometimes make Kabocha Soup with the leftover puree.
Make Custard Mixture
In a large bowl, combine 3 eggs and 3 Tbsp sugar and whisk well.
Add ½ cup milk, ½ cup heavy cream, and 1 tsp vanilla extract, and whisk to combine.
Add the kabocha puree and mix until thoroughly combined.
For the best texture, set a fine-mesh sieve over a large bowl (I use a 4-cup liquid measuring cup) and pass the custard mixture through the sieve. If you have a smaller fine mesh strainer, you can directly pour over the ramekins.
Divide the custard mixture into 4 ramekins.
Cover each ramekin tightly with a sheet of aluminum foil.
Pressure Cook
Add 1 cup water into the Instant Pot and place the steam rack inside.
Put the 4 ramekins on the rack and make sure they are not tilted.
Close the lid and set HIGH pressure for 6 minutes. Make sure the steam release handle points at “sealing” and not “venting”.
When it’s finished cooking, the Instant Pot will switch automatically to the “Keep Warm” mode. Let the pressure release naturally for 10 minutes and then proceed with quick release (DO NOT EXCEED. I recommend to set a timer.) by turning the steam release handle to the “venting” position to let steam out until the float valve drops down. Hold a kitchen towel and do not place your hand or face over steam release valve. The steam should be left only a little bit after 10 minutes of natural release.
Take out one ramekin and remove aluminum foil. Insert a skewer in the center of the flan to see if the custard is set and no liquid comes out. If it’s not cooked through, repeat the pressure cooking process (the cooking time varies depending on your result).
Let cool on the counter until the flan is room temperature. Then put the ramekins on a tray, cover with paper towel (to absorb condensation/moisture) and plastic, and transfer to the refrigerator to chill for at least 2 hours, or preferably overnight.
To Serve
Run a knife around the ramekins.
Hold the ramekin and plate together and shake vigorously a few times to invert onto a plate. Enjoy!

At this point, pour in the brandy and allow to sizzle vigorously for a couple of seconds before setting it alight with a lighter or match. Allow to burn out, shaking the pan every few seconds.
Melt the remaining 30g of butter for the purses either in a pan or placing in the microwave on high power for a few seconds. Cut the filo pastry sheets in half width-ways, so you get 6 pieces. Layer them on top of each other, brushing the top of each bottom sheet with butter before placing a new sheet on top. Once all three sheets are in place, brush the top again with butter.
Preheat your oven to 220 degrees Celsius and meanwhile place half of the cooked pear mixture into the centre of the pastry sheets. Bring the corners together and press gently at the top to form a small pouch or bag shape. Brush liberally again with butter and place onto a lightly greased baking sheet.

Add water till 1-2 inches above azuki beans.
Bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat. Once boiling, put an otoshibuta (drop lid) over the azuki beans (Otoshibuta will prevent the beans from dancing around too much). Turn down the heat to medium-low and keep it simmering for the next 1 to 1.5 hours.
Water will evaporate so you need to keep adding water so the beans are submerged. After 1 hour, pick one bean and mash it with your fingers. If it is mashed easily, it's done.
To Make Tsubuan (Chunky Red Bean Paste)
Drain the azuki beans over a sieve.
Put the beans in the same pot. Turn the heat to medium-low heat and add half of the sugar.
Mix well with the azuki beans. Once sugar is dissolved, add the rest of the sugar.
Mix, stirring constantly and add the salt.
If you plan to use red bean for Zenzai (Oshiruko), you can use it right away. If you prefer a thicker version, reduce the soup.
Let the moisture evaporate. When you can draw a line on the bottom of the pot, turn off the heat. Don't worry if it's still loose; Anko will continue to thicken as it cools. Transfer to a flat baking sheet to let cool completely. Tsubuan is ready to use. Scroll down to see how to store it.
To Make Koshian (Fine Red Bean Paste)
Drain the azuki beans over a sieve, reserving some cooking liquid.

For the ramekins: Brush the ramekins with butter, using upward strokes. Put 1 tsp. sugar in each ramekin and rotate the ramekin to dust the insides with sugar. Remove excess sugar from the ramekin and chill in refrigerator to set (This gives the souffles something to grip on to as the batter climbs up the sides of the ramekins during baking.).
For the custard: In a large bowl, beat the egg yolks and sugar together.
Sift the flour into the egg mixture and mix well.
Heat the milk and heavy cream in a small saucepan until almost boiling.
Add a splash of hot milk mixture into the egg mixture and whisk well until the mixture is smooth.
Then gradually whisk in the rest of the milk mixture.
Pour the mixture back into the saucepan. Whisk the mixture ALL TIMES over a medium-low heat for 3-4 minutes until thickened and smooth. KEEP WHISKING during this process otherwise your custard will overcook and become clumpy.
When the custard has thickened, immediately transfer to a bowl (otherwise remaining heat from the saucepan will “overcook” the mixture). Cover with plastic wrap and cool to room temperature for about 30 minutes (or you can put in the fridge to make this process faster).
Once the custard has cool down, sift matcha green tea powder into the custard.
For the meringue: Whisk the egg whites in a clean bowl till bubbles start to form (Kitchen Aid mixer Level 3 for 2 minutes).
Start adding sugar gradually a spoonful at a time. Once you add all the sugar, increase the speed to Level 8 and whisk to make a firm, glossy meringue, about 3-4 minutes.

To Preheat the Oven
Preheat the convection oven (with fan) to 450ºF (230ºC). If you don’t have an oven with fan, preheat the conventional oven to 475ºF (245ºC). If your oven doesn’t get hot very well, you can preheat to the hottest oven temperature (mine is 550ºF (290ºC)) for 30-60 minutes. As for the oven rack, I used the middle rack for the convection oven (the fan circulates the air, so the middle rack is ideal). If you use the conventional oven, move the rack slightly higher as heat rises and the top of the oven is higher temperature. However, keep in mind that a 3-inch deep cake pan needs extra space for rising.
To Prepare the Cake Pan
Line a 6-inch (15-cm) round cake pan with 2 large sheets of parchment paper. When you cut 2 sheets of parchment papers, leave at least 2 inches (5 cm) of overhang around all edges. Fold the parchment paper twice to find the center of the paper.
Overlap 2 sheets of parchment paper so the cross/center matches and place them over in the middle of the pan. Make sure the longer side is against each other. Place the removable bottom on top.
Press down the removable bottom and the parchment paper, creasing against the bottom of the cake pan to fit snugly in the pan. Press the paper around the cake pan too.
Gently take out the removable bottom and the parchment-paper “mold”. Place the removable bottom back into the cake pan (as it should be). Then place the parchment-paper “mold” into the cake pan. Press the paper down to fit perfectly.
To Make the Batter
Make sure the cream cheese is at room temperature. If not, microwave the cold cream cheese at half power (50%) for 45 seconds, or microwave at 15 seconds incremental.
Press down the cream cheese and make it soft. Then add sugar.
Combine cream cheese with sugar by rubbing the mixture with the spatula against the bowl. The cream cheese will become fluffy and smooth as the sugar granules disappear. Scrape both bowl and spatula often to ensure that nothing sticks to them and that there are no lumps.
Out of the 3 eggs, you will only need 2 whole eggs and 1 egg yolk. Whisk them well in a bowl.
Slowly and gradually add the beaten egg 2-3 separate times. Don’t add more egg until the batter is smooth and no lumps, blending COMPLETELY and THOROUGHLY.
Frequently scrape off the batter from the bowl and spatula and make sure there are no lumps in the batter.
Add the rest of the eggs and blend well.
Take out a small portion of the batter to a clean bowl. I transferred about 2 scoops of batter.
Sift the matcha a little bit at a time as you stir and blend together. Then sift more and continue as you finish sifting and blending in all the matcha.
Mix all together and if it’s too thick, add more batter.
Blend again until smooth (no lumps). I added another scoop of batter.
Now transfer the matcha batter back into the main batter.
Blend the two batters very well until it has a smooth consistency.
Next, sift the cake flour and cornstarch into the batter as you stir and blend together. Then sift more and continue as you finish sifting and blending in all the flour. Take your time to do this. You don’t want any lumps.
Gradually add heavy cream while you stir. Mix until it’s all combined. Add salt and blend together.
Pour the cake batter into the prepared pan in one go (avoid stop-and-go) so the air pockets don’t go in.
Tap the cake pan on the countertop a few times. With a bamboo skewer or toothpick, pop the air bubbles if there are any, and then run the batter with it to remove any bubbles.
To Bake
As a prevention, you can bake the cheesecake on a baking sheet, just in case it overflows. Mine never did, but I use it as it’s easier to transfer the cake pan from and to the oven. Transfer the cake pan to the oven and bake at 450ºF (230ºC) (or 475ºF (245ºC) if conventional oven) until the top is dark amber/brown and the center is still very jiggly, about 30 minutes (please keep an eye on your cheesecake because every oven is different). My top doesn’t start becoming dark until close to a 30-minute mark. If you love the “gooey/ oozy” texture and bake for a less amount of time than I provided, then you must chill before serving. NEVER overcook the cake by extending the bake time, even though the top doesn't turn dark. You can't fix it when the texture of the filling curdles from overcooking. You probably need to adjust the oven temperature (or oven rack or preheating time) next time you make it.
To Cool
Take out the cake when the surface is dark, burnt color. The cake should wobble when you gently shake the pan. Let the cheesecake cool in the pan on a wire rack until it reaches room temperature, about 2-3 hours. Don’t put it on the countertop directly and make sure the air can go through under the cake pan. You can place it on top of the stovetop, if it's is not in use.
To Chill
You can skip chilling and serve at room temperature (which we like, too). If you prefer to serve chilled cheesecake or a firmer cheesecake, place the cheesecake, covered in cloth (don’t use plastic, as condensation may drop onto the cake), in the refrigerator for 4 hours.
To Serve
Remove the cheesecake from the cake pan and carefully peel back the parchment paper. If you have chilled the cake, let stand at room temperature for at least 30 minutes or up to 2 hours before serving.
To Store
You can store the cheesecake in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.",en-US,4.63,,Just One Cookbook,300,1 serving(s),2216 kcal,128 g,42 g,173 g,99 g,1107 mg,1103 mg,108 g,1 serving,1 g,1 g

If you use regular size aluminum foil, make sure to seal the two sheets of foil very tightly by folding two edges and make one big foil.
In the bowl of the electric mixer, beat blueberry cream cheese and sugar on medium-high speed until smooth.
Add the softened butter and mix until thoroughly incorporated.
Add the beaten egg yolk and heavy cream and mix well.
Add lemon juice and rum and mix until the batter is very smooth.
Add the flour all at once and mix well.
Transfer the batter to a large bowl. Wash the mixer bowl and dry completely. Make sure there is no oil or water in the bowl (IMPORTANT).
To make meringue, beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form. In the bowl of electric mixer, whip the egg whites on medium low speed (speed 4) till opaque and foamy and bubbly. Then add 1/4 of the sugar at a time as the mixer runs. Once all of the sugar has been added, increase the mixer speed to high (speed 10) and whip for approximately 4 minutes, until the meringue has doubled in volume and is thick and glossy.
To test for stiff peaks, the peaks should stand straight up when you lift up the beaters. The whites should not slide around. If the meringue has not reached the desired consistency, continue whipping at high speed for another 30 seconds, then stop and test again. Once the egg whites are over beaten, they can't be used for the recipe.
Add 1/3 of the meringue to the batter and mix well.
Then add the rest of the meringue all at once and fold it in (not mix this time).
Pour the batter in the cake pan and then drop the pan from 2-3"" (5-7 cm) high a few times onto the countertop to remove any air bubbles. Smooth out the surface.
Place the cake pan in a large roasting pan and pour 1"" (2.5 cm) of boiling water in the roasting pan. Place the baking pan in the middle rack of the oven. (The reason why we put hot water in the pan is that steam will help making cake soft and moist and hot water around the cake will gradually cook inside the cake while baking in the oven.)
Bake at 320F (160C) for 60 minutes or until light golden brown. Then reduce temperature to 300F (150C) and bake for another 30 minutes.
When a wooden skewer inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean without wet batter, turn off the oven. Let the cake sit in the oven with the door slightly ajar for 15 minutes. Remove from the oven, take out the cake pan from the roasting pan, and then let cool to room temperature on a wire rack. Refrigerate at least 4 hours or overnight.
For blueberry topping, bring blueberries and water to a boil in a medium saucepan, stirring occasionally. In a small bowl, whisk together 1 Tbsp. water and 1 Tbsp. corn starch until combined. Add the mixture into the blueberries and cook until thickened. Remove from the heat and serve over cheesecake before serving.

Put Yomogi in a bowl and add hot water. Use a fork to combine yomogi and water well.
Set aside for 5 minutes. Then strain the yomogi using a fine mesh strainer. Discard the liquid.
Combine joshinko, shiratamako, and sugar in a large bowl and mix all together.
Add hot water in small increments to combine (NEVER pour water at once). Mix well before you add more water. When the texture of the dough is similar to an earlobe texture, it’s good to go. It’s a funny comparison but that’s the traditional way to check the consistency. If you put too much water and your dough is too soft, add more joshinko.
Divide the dough into thirds. Add the red food coloring to one third, the yomogi to another third, and keep the last one as it is.
Knead each dough until the color is even and well combined.
Roll the dough into 8 even-sized balls for each color. I used a #60 cookie scooper that holds 2 tsp. I have to say it’s a bit bigger than the actual dango, so you can probably use 1 to 1.5 tsp. would be the ideal size. You might be able to get 12 dango total.
Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook the white dango in boiling water until they start floating, about 8 minutes. Stir in the beginning so the dango won't stick at the bottom. Once floating, cook for another 1 minute.
Remove the white dango from the water and immediately let them cool in iced water for 1 minute. Then transfer to a plate.
Next, work on the pink dango, and repeat the same process. Then finish with the green dango. As you see, the boiling water changes color, so I recommend starting from light to dark color so the white dango doesn’t get stained.
Put one of each color dango onto a skewer, in the order of green, white, and pink. Serve at room temperature.
To Store
Put dango in an airtight container and keep at room temperature for up to 2 days. If you live in a hot climate, find a cool place to store, but not in the refrigerator as dango will become too tough. Enjoy in 2 days.",en-US,4.47,,Just One Cookbook,90,8 serving(s),,,,,,,,,,,

Please use cake flour only! It’s important not to use flour with a high gluten content such as bread flour or all-purpose/plain flour for this recipe. Otherwise, you will end up with a rubbery cake.
To make crepe batter
Add the milk and sugar in a small sauce pan and combine well. Heat on medium heat until the milk is warm to touch.
Beat the eggs in a large bowl. Then slowly add a small amount of warm milk while whisking. While whisking, slowly add the melted butter to the mixture.
Set up a fine-mesh sieve over the bowl and add cake flour, matcha powder, and baking powder. Sift half of the dry ingredients into the batter and whisk to combine the dry and wet ingredients together.
Sift the rest of dry ingredients and mix until there is no lump in the batter. IMPORTANT: Do not overmix; mixing and stirring increases gluten formation in the batter, which causes a rubbery texture.
Set the fine-mesh sieve over a large bowl and pour the batter. This will remove any lumps and get a smooth texture. Cover with plastic wrap to refrigerate for at least 1 hour (DO NOT SKIP!). Tip: If you overmix the batter, you may want to rest the batter for longer hours. Resting the batter is important because it allows the gluten to relax. If you don't rest long enough the crepes will be more rubbery due to gluten development.
To cook the crepes
Set a 12-inch non-stick frying pan on low heat. Once the pan is hot, brush the oil and remove excess oil with a paper towel (don’t worry, oil is applied thinly). Gently stir the batter right before scooping with a ladle (otherwise, the batter will be too thick toward the end). Pour the batter just enough to cover the bottom of the frying pan, about 1/3 cup for my pan. After trying the first crepe and if you want to make a thinner crepe, gradually add milk to adjust the batter.
Cook for 2 minutes without touching. By now you’d see the outside edge of the crepe gets a tiny bit crispier. Using a chopstick, spatula, or hand, flip the crepe.
Cook the other side for 30 seconds and transfer to a working surface lined with parchment paper.
Set a 10-inch non-stick frying pan on low heat. Once the pan is hot*, brush the oil and remove excess oil with a paper towel. Pour the batter just enough to cover the bottom of the frying pan, about ¼ cup (60 ml) for my pan. *The hot pan helps the water in eggs and milk turn into steam and the crepe will puff up and become softer. But it can't be too hot, which ends up cooking the crepe too fast and you can't swirl the batter into a thin layer.
Cook for 2 minutes without touching. By now you’d see the outside edge of the crepe gets a tiny bit crispier. Using a chopstick, spatula, or hand, flip the crepe.
Cook the other side for 30 seconds and transfer to a working surface lined with parchment paper.
Continue this process until all the batter is used. Make sure to stir the batter EVERY TIME before you make a new batch (otherwise, the batter will be too thick toward the end). With this batter, I could make 1 large one that goes on top, and 13 crepes.
To make whipped cream
Prepare an ice bath by adding ice cubes and water to a larger bowl and set a smaller bowl on top. Add the heavy whipping cream and start whisking at the lower speed. Once you see bubbles, slowly add granulated sugar.
Whip the cream until stiff, not hard stiff (like 90%).
To assemble the mille crepe cake
Prepare two long parchment paper strips on a working surface or a rotating cake stand (I used IKEA's lazy susan). These strips will go under the first layer of crepe (this is for easy transportation).
First place the larger crepe. This will be the top layer when we flip. Put the freshly whipped cream in the middle and spread evenly, leaving the outer 2"" (5 cm).
Place another crepe on top and spread whip cream evenly, leaving outer ½ inch.
Continue this process until the last crepe is placed on top.
Prepare a round curved shallow dish (mine is from IKEA) and place a large piece of plastic wrap on top. Make sure to remove any air pockets and smooth them out. Transfer the mille crepe to the shallow dish by holding the strips you made. Once you place nicely in the middle of the bowl, remove the strips.
Wrap the mille crepe with plastic wrap from one corner to clockwise. This will make the final cake evenly round, instead of wrap randomly. Secure the end with a clip (I use one from IKEA). Refrigerate for at least 2 hours until the cake is set.
To serve
Once chilled, remove the plastic wrap and flip onto the serving platter.
Dust more matcha powder over the cake. Make the fresh whipped cream if you plan to serve with the cake. Serve and enjoy within a few days as we are using fresh cream.",en-US,4.57,,Just One Cookbook,240,1 serving(s),,,,,,,,,,,

Place the cream, milk, and matcha into a medium saucepan over medium heat. Scald the mixture, stirring often, until it’s very hot to the touch but not boiled. Remove from the heat and let it cool. In the meantime, start a kettle of water on the stove.
In a medium bowl, whisk together 1/2 cup sugar and the egg yolks, until well blended and the mixture becomes pale yellow.
Temper the egg and sugar mixture with the milk and cream, adding 1/2 cup at a time, whisking vigorously. You don't want to cook the egg by pouring the milk and cream too fast.
Place a sieve over a large bowl and strain the mixture through the sieve.
Divide the liquid between 6 medium ramekins. Place the ramekins into a large deep baking or roasting pan.
Carefully pour boiling water into the pan to come halfway up the sides of the ramekins.

Cover the glutinous rice with 2” (5cm) cold water and soak it for a minimum of 3 hours, preferably overnight.
1st steam
Once soaked, drain off the water and rinse the rice a few times.
Prepare your steamer by bringing the water to a boil.
Add the soaked rice into a heat-proof bowl and place it on the steamer rack. Steam, covered, for 30 minutes for overnight-soaked rice, or for 45 minutes for 3-hour-soaked rice. Once done, the rice should be edible, but still quite tough.
Assemble
While steaming the rice, arrange the rice toppings in the base of a wide heat-proof bowl. (*Footnote 2)
Once the rice is steamed, add the coconut oil and sugar. Stir thoroughly until the sugar melts and the rice is evenly coated with oil.
Press the seasoned rice into the bowl with the toppings. Be careful not to disturb the pattern you’ve created. Fill two thirds of the bowl with rice while creating a dent in the middle for the red bean paste.
Add the red bean paste in the middle and use the back of a spoon to flatten it into a thin layer.
Add the rest of the rice and use a spoon to flatten it.
At this stage, you can store the rice, covered with plastic wrap, in the fridge for 1 to 2 days. Follow the rest of the instructions prior to serving.
2nd steam
Place the assembled rice back to the steamer and steam it for an additional 30 minutes.
Syrup
Prepare the syrup while steaming the assembled rice. Combine the water, sugar, and chrysanthemum buds in a small saucepan and heat it over medium heat until boiling. Turn to medium-low heat. Simmer for 10 minutes.
Mix the cornstarch with 1 teaspoon of water until the cornstarch has dissolved completely.
When the chrysanthemum mixture is cooked, pour in the cornstarch slurry. Keep cooking and stirring constantly, until the syrup slightly thickens. Pour the syrup over a strainer into a bowl and discard the chrysanthemum buds.
Serving

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (177 C). Line 12 cupcake tins with paper liners.
Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl. Stir to mix well.
Prepare an electric mixer and set it aside. Create a double boiler by choosing a medium and a small pot, so you can stack the small one into the medium pot. Add water to the medium pot to the height that covers the bottom of the small pot. Bring water to a simmer. Add white chocolate, butter, lemon juice, and milk to the small pot. Dip the bottom of the small pot into the simmering water. Whisk and cook until the ingredients are melted and combined. Remove the small pot from the water and place it on a working surface. Immediately add the granulated sugar into the small pot, and whisk at low speed with an electric mixer until the sugar is fully incorporated.
Add the eggs, one at a time. Whisk to mix well.
Add the vanilla extract. Whisk to mix well.
Gradually add the dry mixture, mix until just incorporated.
Fill the lined cupcake tins with the batter until almost full. Bake for 17 to 20 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
Transfer to a cooling rack to cool down completely. You can make the cupcakes a day ahead and store them in a container at room temperature.
Cream frosting
Add chocolate and 1/2 cup heavy cream into a medium-sized bowl.

Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 C). Bring a kettle of water to a boil, keep covered and sit on lowest heat to keep warm. Place eight 2.7-oz. (80ml) or four 6-oz (177-ml) ramekins (or heatproof jars) into a deep baking tray.
Add milk, cream, and ginger into a small saucepan. Cook over medium heat until almost simmering. Immediately remove the pan from the stove. Let steep for 15 minutes to allow the ginger to infuse. Remove ginger using a slotted spoon and discard. Cook the mixture again until it almost reaches a simmer.
While heating the cream mixture (after you've done infused the ginger), combine egg yolks and sugar in a medium-sized mixing bowl. Mix until the sugar is just incorporated.
Slowly pour about 1/2 cup of the heated cream mixture into the egg yolks and whisk until fully mixed. This step will bring the egg yolk toward the temperature of the hot liquid, so it won’t be cooked into solid egg when you add the rest of the cream.
Add the rest of the cream mixture while whisking, until everything is fully mixed. Pour the mixture over a strainer into a milk pan to remove any extra bits of ginger. Use a spoon to remove the foam from the surface and discard.
Pour the custard mixture into the ramekins until each of them is 80% filled.
Place the baking tray into the preheated oven. Then pour the hot water into the baking tray, until it fills half way up the height of the ramekins.
Bake until the mixture is just set, about 25 to 30 minutes. (*Footnote 1)
Remove the ramekins from the water bath using a spatula and transfer them onto a cooling rack. Let cool to room temperature, for about 1 hour. Then seal the ramekins with plastic wrap (or cover the jars with lids) and store them in the fridge for at least 1 hour, up to overnight, before serving. The custard will stay good for 3 to 4 days in the fridge, but freshly made ones taste the best.
Sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon over each chilled custard. Shake the ramekin gently so the surface is evenly covered. Light up your kitchen torch, then cook the sugar by positioning the torch at a 45-degree angle, about 6 inches (15-cm) from the sugar. Move your torch back and forth slowly so it heats up the sugar evenly and does not create any burned spots. When the sugar starts bubbling and melting and some spots turn light brown, stop the torch. The sugar will continue to cook a bit more and then set, forming a uniform golden brown crust.

Soak for a minimum of 6 hours or up to overnight. Gently rinse the nest with your fingers during the soaking and change the water once. If you see small feathers attached to the bird nest, carefully remove them with tweezers and discard them.
Once the nest is soaked, gently tear it into smaller long pieces along the threads.
Braised bird's nest in Asian pear
Cut each Asian pear into two pieces by cutting through the core about 1/3 of the way from the top. Use the larger piece as a bowl and the smaller piece as the lid. Use a spoon or melon scoop to scoop out the inner part of the bigger piece and make the pear into a small bowl. You can cut a zig-zag pattern if you like. It won’t affect the cooking.
Divide up the bird nest and fill 2/3 of each pear with the nest. Add filtered water to cover, a few pieces of goji berries, and 1 piece rock sugar. Cover the pear with the lid you cut off earlier.
Place the pear in a small bowl and transfer the bowl into a big skillet. Add water until it reaches halfway up the bowl.
Cover the skillet and cook over medium high heat, until water reaches a boil and steam comes from the skillet. Turn to medium heat and let braise for 40 minutes.
Once the bird nests are cooked, transfer the small bowls onto the kitchen counter with your oven mitts on. Let cool until it can be handled by hand.
You can further sweeten it with syrup or honey, if needed. Serve the bird nest warm or at room temperature as a dessert.

Combine red beans and 3 cups of water in pressure cooker. Lock the lid and heat over medium high heat until rated pressure has been reached. Turn to lowest heat and cook at high pressure for 20 minutes. Turn off heat and allow the pressure release naturally.
Remove the lid and stir the beans several times. Add rock sugar and turn back to medium high heat. Stir the beans constantly with a spatula and boil until the mixture has thickened. When you draw a line in the mixture with a spatula and can see the bottom of the pot for 1 or 2 seconds, the beans are finished. Remove from heat and transfer to a large bowl. The red bean “soup” is, at this point, still a thick liquid and not quite as thick as a paste. It will thicken quickly after cooking down, and transform into a paste after it has been chilled.
The paste will last about a week in an airtight container in the fridge, or about a month in the freezer.
To Cook without pressure cooker
Rinse azuki beans and pre-soak them in room temperature water overnight.
Discard the soaking water. Combine beans and 4 cups water in a large pot. Bring the water to a boil, then turn to lowest heat. Simmer, covered, for about 1 hour, until beans are soft and can be easily mashed with a spatula. Throughout the simmering, check the water level and make sure the water still covers the beans, so they won’t be burnt on the bottom. Add water in small amounts, if necessary.

Cut butter into 1/2-inch (1-cm) cubes, transfer to a bowl and place in the freezer for 5 minutes while preparing the dry ingredients. I always do this step to make sure the butter is very cold.
Combine 1 1/2 cups of the flour, salt, and sugar in a food processor. Pulse 2 to 3 times to mix well.
Add the butter cubes. Mix until the butter is chopped to small pieces and well coated with flour, about 15 seconds.
Scrape the bowl and add the remaining 1 cup flour. Pulse 4 to 5 times until the mixture looks crumbly. Transfer everything into a large bowl.
Add ice cubes into 1 cup of water to make ice water. Swirl 6 to 12 tablespoons of the cold water into the flour mixture, 2 to 3 tablespoons at a time, and stir with a fork until the water is fully absorbed. Use your hand to feel the dough often. The dough should hold together when you pinch the flour. If not, continue adding 1 tablespoon of water at a time, until the dough starts to come together. (*Footnote 1)
Start to use your hand to press the flakes and bring the dough together. It is OK if there are some crumbles around.
Transfer the dough and all the crumbles onto a well-floured working surface. Press the dough until it just forms a ball. Divide the dough into two pieces (*Footnote 2).
Wrap and seal the dough with plastic wrap, shape it into a round ball with your hands. Roll the ball into a 1-inch thick disk with a rolling pin.
Transfer the dough into the fridge and chill for at least 1 hour, up to 2 days. To store the dough for a longer time, place it into a ziplock bag, squeeze out the air, and seal. Freeze for up to 3 months and thaw in the fridge overnight before using.
Roll the pie dough for pie crust
Remove one piece of dough from the fridge, unwrap it, and place it on a well-floured working surface for 5 to 10 minutes.
Sprinkle flour on the top of the dough and onto your rolling pin. Try to roll the dough gently. If the dough starts to crack, let it rest for another one or two minutes, until it becomes more pliable.
Roll the dough using a rolling pin and swirl the dough frequently to prevent it from sticking. Roll out the dough into a round sheet that is about 1/8-inch (3-mm) thick, and 1-inch larger than the rim of your pie pan. Rotate the dough frequently so it won’t stick to the surface. Dust with more flour if needed.
Roll the dough over your rolling pin and unroll it over the baking dish (*Footnote 3). Gently arrange the dough to fit the pan. Trim off the excess dough with scissors, leaving about 1/2 inch (1-cm) from the rim of the baking pan.
Tuck the edge of the dough underneath so it creates a thick border that rests on the rim of the baking dish. Crimp the edges by pressing the edge with your finger while holding the two sides with the knuckles of your other hand.
Cover the dough with plastic wrap and transfer to the fridge. Let rest for 30 minutes to 1 hour, until it’s completely cooled and turns solid.
(Optional) make pie decorations (*Footnote 3)
Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper.
Beat the egg with 1 tablespoon water in a small bowl to make an egg wash.
Take out the smaller piece of dough and roll it out according to the pie crust instructions above. I prefer to leave the dough slightly thicker, somewhere between 1/8-inch and 1/4-inch thick (3 to 4-mm), so it’s easier to work with. For the pie decorations, dust extra flour onto the bottom of the dough, so it won’t stick when you cut the dough.
Dust a cookie cutter or decoration mold with flour to cut the dough. If you use the mold like I did, move the cutter around so the piece is completely cut off. Then gently push the lever 3 to 4 few times to make the leaf impression. Do not push it too hard, which will cause the dough to stick to the mold.
Hold the mold on top of the parchment paper and eject the dough. The pie decoration should come off quite easily, in the perfect shape.
Work on the rest of the dough sheet using the same method. Transfer the cookie sheet into the freezer to chill for 5 to 10 minutes, until completely cooled and solid.
Transfer the dough onto your working surface again. Brush the pattern side of the dough with a thin layer of egg wash. Sprinkle with turbinado sugar (*Footnote 4).
Bake
Adjust oven racks so that one is in the middle and one is on the bottom. Place a pizza stone on the bottom rack (Optional). Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 C).
Beat the egg with 1 tablespoon water in a small bowl to make an egg wash.
When the pie is well chilled, transfer it to the kitchen counter. Crumple a piece of parchment paper and flatten it, cover the bottom of the pie and arrange it so it fits the shape. Add pie weights, beans, or rice onto the parchment paper. Transfer the pie onto the pizza stone. Turn the oven to 400 F (200 C). Bake for 30 minutes, or until the edges turn golden.
Place the cookie sheet with pie garnish on the middle rack and bake until the surface turns golden, 15 to 17 minutes.
Once the pie crust is ready, transfer it to the kitchen counter and remove the pie weights. Brush the entire pie crust surface with a thin layer of egg wash. Return it to the bottom of the oven and bake for another 5 to 7 minutes, until the egg wash has dried completely and the bottom of the pie crust turns solid. If you plan to make the pie in advance, you can pre-bake the pie crust one day in advance.
Let the pie crust cool completely. Turn the oven to 350 F (176 C).
Now you can fill the pie with any filling you like, such as this light and fluffy kabocha pumpkin filling. If you are making a double-crust pie, cover the pie with the other piece of dough.
Now continue baking the pie until the filling is cooked, and the top crust turns golden (if using).

Add glutinous rice into a big bowl and water to cover. Let soak overnight.
If using dried bamboo leaves
Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add bamboo leaves and boil for 5 to 8 minutes, until the leaves turn soft but are still green in color. Transfer the bamboo leaves to a plate.
If using fresh bamboo leaves
Heat a large pot of water to just under boiling. Turn off heat. Dip bamboo leaves in the hot water and let them soak for 1 to 2 minutes, until soft.
To wrap zongzi
Place the bamboo leaves, cotton twine, red bean paste, glutinous rice (do not discard the water), and two spoons on the working surface.
If the bamboo leaves are less than 8 cm (3 inches) wide, use two at a time. Otherwise, you can use one leaf. Overlap the leaves by 50% to 60% if using more than one. Fold the leaves with both hands to shape them like a funnel, without leaving an opening at the bottom.
Hold the funnel with one hand. Start adding glutinous rice into it with a spoon with the other hand, until halfway filled. You should add water with the rice, so the rice fills the leaf nicely while the water drips away from the bottom. Scoop about 1 tablespoon of red bean paste (or more if the zongzi size is bigger) and place it on the rice. Continue to fill the funnel with rice, until almost level with the edge. Pat the rice a bit so the top is flat. You don’t need to compress the rice too hard, otherwise the rice will be squeezed into the red bean paste.
Continue to hold the funnel with the same hand. Use the other hand to fold the longer side of the leaf as a lid to cover the rice. Continue to fold the longer side of the leaf, until it wraps the funnel. Hold the zongzi with one hand and use the other hand to tie it up with the cotton twine. The finished zongzi should have edges that are 8 to 10 centimeters (3 to 4 inches) long. Work on the rest of zongzi using the same method. (refer to the video for how to tie zongzi)
Place the zongzi in a large pot and add water until it almost covers the zongzi. Place a heavy plate on top to keep the zongzi in the water while cooking. Cover the pot and bring to a boil over high heat. Turn to low (or lowest) heat and let the water continue boiling. Keep covered and simmer for 3 hours.
Transfer one zongzi to a plate to cool off until you can handle it. Untie and slice it in half to make sure it’s cooked through (if the zongzi is very large, it might require more cooking time, up to 4 hours). Transfer all the zongzi to a plate to cool off.
Untie the zongzi right before serving and discard the leaves. Serve warm or cold with honey or sugar. Dip the zongzi in honey or sugar while eating.
To store zongzi, place in a plastic bags after cooling off and seal the bag. Store in fridge up to 3 days or in freezer up to 2 months.
To serve leftover zongzi. Let thaw completely (if frozen). Steam or gently boil in a pot of water until warm. Or you can place the zongzi on the kitchen counter until they return to room temperature, then serve cold. I personally prefer warm zongzi, because they have a better texture than the cold one.",en-US,5.0,,Omnivore's Cookbook,210,10 serving(s),156 kcal,34.3 g,3.2 g,0.2 g,,,6 mg,4.7 g,36 g,1.1 g,

Mince apples into 3 to 4 millimeters (0.1 inch) cubes. The 2 apples should generate about 4 cups of minced apple (about 500 grams / 1 pound).
Place apple and orange peel in a small saucepan and heat over medium heat. Stir and cook until the juice starts to come out, about 5 minutes. Add sugar and cook for another 5 minutes. Add cinnamon powder, cloves and salt and cook over medium heat until the sauce thickens. Begin adding apple juice, 4 tablespoons at a time. Continue cooking over medium heat, until the color of the apple turns amber and the sauce can hold its shape. The amount of apple juice you need will depend on the type of apple. I used 150 milliliters apple juice and 15 minutes for cooking two very crisp and sweet fuji apples.
Transfer the apple sauce to a small bowl to let it cool. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the fridge.
To make cookies
When the apple sauce has cooled off completely, add flour into a large glass bowl and set aside.
Add butter, vegetable oil, water, sugar and salt to a medium-size sauce pan. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally.
The butter will start to bubble and rise. The bubbles should be tiny and have a pale yellow color. When the bubbles subside, the color darkens, and the tiny bubbles nearly disappear, turn off heat immediately and add the hot butter mixture to the flour. Stir immediately with a silicone spatula until dough forms.
Wait until the dough cools off a bit and can be handled by hand, about 3 minutes. Knead the dough by hand a few times. Break off a piece of dough by hand. The dough should be very soft and easy to to spread without feeling crumbly. If the dough is too dry, blend in 1 to 2 teaspoons water and try again. Work on the dough while it’s warm.
To assemble cookies
Preheat oven to 210 degrees C (410 F). Line a baking tray with parchment.
Divide the dough into 4 approximately even sized pieces, then further divide each piece to 5 small doughs. Work on the small doughs one by one.
Use both hands to shape the dough into a round ball. Flatten the ball to a round disc, about palm-sized. Place about 1 teaspoon of applesauce in the middle of the dough.
Use right hand to wrap the dough toward the center, while using left hand to push the filling inside, until it shapes a ball. Shape the dough with both hands until round and place on parchment, at least a finger’s width apart. Work on the cookies one by one in this way.
Use a fork to prick the top of each cookie.
Bake at 210 degrees C (410 F) until the top of the cookies turns golden brown, about 15 minutes. Transfer the cookies to a wooden board to cool off completely.

Soak the glutinous rice for 4 hours at room temperature or overnight in the fridge.
Cook
Add the sesame seeds to a large skillet. Shake the pan so the seeds are spread out in a thin layer. Toast over medium heat until you can smell the fragrance, 2 to 3 minutes. (*Footnote 3)
Drain the soaked glutinous rice and transfer it to a blender, along with the toasted sesame seeds and 2 cups of water. Blend until it forms a very smooth soup, 1 minute in a Vitamix, or up to 3 minutes in a blender.
Transfer the mixture to a medium-sized saucepan. Add 3 cups of water. Heat over medium heat until boiling. Stir constantly during the whole process to prevent the bottom from sticking (*Footnote 4).

Drain the water to remove the excess starch. Repeat once, then add water to cover. Soak the sticky rice for a minimum of 1 hour, up to 5 hours. Rinse again and drain the water.
Transfer the rice to a heatproof bowl, add about 2 inches of water to your steamer (not into the rice), place the heatproof rice bowl on the steaming rack in the steamer, and cover the steamer. Turn to medium-high heat to bring the water to a boil. When the steam starts to come out of the pot, turn to medium heat. Steam for 20 to 25 minutes, until the rice is cooked through, with no hard raw bits in the middle. Remove the pot from the stove. Let sit, covered, while you prepare the sauce.
Add the coconut milk, sugar, and salt to a saucepan. Cook over medium heat until the mixture is hot and the sugar is melted. Do not bring the coconut sauce to a boil.
Combine the cornstarch and 4 tablespoons water in a small bowl. Stir to completely dissolve the cornstarch. Add half of the slurry to the sauce. Stir immediately to thicken the sauce. You can adjust the thickness of the sauce by slowly adding a bit more water or cornstarch slurry, if needed. The sauce shouldn’t be too thick, but should coat the back of a spoon.
Carefully remove the sticky rice bowl from the steamer with your oven mitts on. Pour half of the sauce into the bowl. Stir to mix well.
The mango sticky rice is ready to serve when the rice mixture and the sauce cool to room temperature. You can serve it or store the extra sauce and the sauce-rice mixture separately in the fridge until ready to serve, up to 3 days. The sauce will further thicken when cooled. Stir in more coconut milk to dilute the sauce if it gets too thick.
To serve, transfer the coconut rice into serving bowls or plates. Place the sliced mango on the side. Pour a few spoonful of the extra coconut sauce on top of the rice. Garnish with toasted sesame seeds, if using.
If you use refrigerated sticky rice, you can gently heat it in the microwave to bring it to room temperature before serving, for a better texture. However, it’s highly recommended to serve the rice when it’s fresh, for best results.

When the water start to boil, turn to low heat. Simmer, covered, until the beans turn tender and start to fall apart, about 1 hour. Remove from heat.
(Optional) If you like a creamy soup, use an immersion blender to blend the beans until it reaches your desired consistency. Normally, the soup is quite coarse and still contains bits of red beans. Or you can blend the soup until smooth if you prefer.
Add the salt. Add the sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, and stir to mix well. Taste the soup until it reaches the desired sweetness. I usually use 2 tablespoons for a mild sweet taste for a regular dessert or afternoon snack. But I would ramp up the sugar to 4 tablespoons if I’m planning serve the dish at a dinner party.

Spread peanuts in a pan and heat over medium heat on stove. When the pan turns warm, turn to medium low heat. Shake the pan occasionally for even cooking. Toast until the peanuts turn golden but not darkly browned. Alternatively, you can roast the peanuts in 350 F oven for 8 to 15 minutes, or until the surface turns golden. Shake the pan occasionally during baking.
Ground the peanuts in batches by using a coffee grinder, in a mini food processor, or by using a mortar and pestle until finely grounded, but not into powder. You can leave the pieces a bit larger if you want a chewy texture. Transfer to a bowl. Add peanut butter, sugar and coconut oil. Stir to mix well. Transfer to fridge to harden for about 30 minutes or longer, until it’s possible to scoop out the filling and shape it. If you leave the filling in the fridge for a longer time, it will harden even more and might be a bit difficult to shape. If this is the case, place the filling in room temperature for 5 minutes to let it soften a bit before shaping.
Use a small spoon to scoop about 1 teaspoon to 1 and 1/2 teaspoon of filling. Shape it quickly into a ball, and place on a small tray or in a container.
Transfer the peanut butter balls into the freezer while making the dough.
Dough
Add glutinous rice flour in a big bowl. Slowly add warm water and whisk with a pair of chopsticks (or a spatula). When the water is fully absorbed, use your hands to press and work it into a dough. If the dough is too sticky, add more glutinous rice flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, and keep kneading the dough. Unlike wheat flour dough, rice flour dough does not require a lot of kneading, so it is done once the dough is shaped. Transfer the dough to a big bowl and cover with plastic wrap or a clean wet towel, to prevent it from drying out.
Wrap
Divide the dough into 4 equal pieces. Shape each piece into a round ball. Work on one dough ball at a time and return the three dough balls back into the large bowl, then cover with plastic wrap.
Roll the dough ball into a long even strip. Cut to 8 pieces. Roll into small balls.
Work on the dough balls one by one. Flatten the dough into a round disk that has a dent in the center. Place the filling in the center of the dough. Seal the filling carefully by wrapping and spreading the dough. When you cannot see the filling anymore, roll the dough into a round ball by using both hands.
If you find the dumpling is too difficult to seal, knead the rest dough balls back together into one big dough ball again, cut into 5 pieces to 6 pieces and try again. It is very important to wrap and seal the dough tightly, so the dumplings won’t fall apart during cooking.
The filling will become soft if placed in room temperature for too long and become very difficult to wrap, especially if you’re using coconut oil. I suggest you to take out a few filling balls at a time to work with, and store the rest in the freezer.
Work on the rest of the dough balls using the same method.
Now you can cook the rice balls or freeze them for later.
Cook
Bring a pot of water to a boil. Carefully add the number of rice balls you plan to serve. Cook and stir occasionally until the rice balls float on top and the skins look translucent.
Immediately transfer the rice balls to small serving bowls with just enough boiling water to cover them. We usually eat the rice balls with some boiling water. If it’s not sweet enough for you, add a few drops of honey or osmanthus syrup into the boiling water to sweeten it.
Store
Place leftover filling in a ziplock bag, squeeze out as much as air as possible, and seal. Store in the fridge for 1 week or in the freezer for up to 3 months.
To store the raw tang yuan, place them on a tray, 1 finger apart, and cover with a plastic wrap. Freeze until completely frozen. Transfer to a ziplock bag or airtight container, store in the freezer for 2 to 3 months.

Measure out 1 cup of water (You will use slightly less than a cup). Slowly add water into the flour in 4 to 5 pours, and stir with a fork until the water is fully incorporated with the flour. There should be no dry flour left, and the flour should start to have the texture of dough - soft but not runny. If the dough gets too soft and becomes difficult to shape, add more rice flour, a tablespoon at a time. Use your hand to press and knead the dough a few times, until the texture becomes consistent (* see footnote). The dough should be soft and easy to shape. When you lift the dough from the bowl, it should slightly stick to the bottom of the bowl.
Dust a working surface with rice flour and transfer the dough onto it. Divide the dough in half. Roll the dough with both hands to shape it into a long, even rod. Divide the dough equally into 6 pieces. Shape each piece into a round ball and set aside.
To make the cake, place one rice dough ball in your palm and use the other hand to gently press it into a round, flat piece (it’s very easy to shape, so you won’t need a rolling pin), about 6 centimeters (2.5 inches) in diameter, 6 millimeters (1/4 inch) in thickness.
Scoop about 2 tablespoons of red bean paste and shape the paste into a ball. Place the ball of bean paste in the center of the round dough. Pinch the edges of the dough together to completely enclose the bean paste. When the cake is shaped like a ball, gently use your palm to press it, until it is shaped like a pancake, about 6 centimeters (2.5 inches) in diameter and 1.2 centimeters (1/2 inches) in thickness. Spread 1 tablespoon of sesame seeds onto the working surface, place the cake on top of them, and gently press. Shake off the extra sesame seeds, flip the cake, and press the other side onto the seeds. Craft the rest of the cakes in the same manner.
Heat 1 teaspoon of vegetable oil a non-stick skillet over medium heat. When the oil is hot, turn to medium low heat and place 4 cakes into the skillet. Cook until the bottom of the cake turns golden brown, after 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook the other side. Transfer the cakes to a large plate to cool. Cook the rest of the cakes in the same manner.

Mix the cornstarch, all-purpose flour, and half of the sugar together in a small bowl.
Place the egg yolks in a large bowl. Stir a few times to mix the yolks.
Add the milk and the remaining half of the sugar into a small saucepan. Heat over medium heat. Stir occasionally to dissolve the sugar completely. Cook until it reaches about 120 F/ 49 C (no more than 150 F / 65 C). You might see a few bubbles here and there. If the milk starts foaming, it’s too hot.
While the milk starts to get warm, add the dry ingredients (from step 1) into the bowl with the egg yolks. Whisk until it forms an even paste. Do not add the dry ingredients too early, because the sugar will change the texture of the eggs.
Add the warm milk into the egg yolk mixture, about 1/4 cup at a time. Whisk constantly until the milk is fully incorporated into the paste. Continue to add more milk a 1/4 cup at a time and keep stirring, until it forms a thin, smooth mixture and all the milk is added.
Return the mixture back into the pot (the one you used to heat the milk). Heat over medium heat and stir constantly, until the mixture thickens, 5 minutes or so. Keep cooking and stirring, until you can draw a line on the bottom of the pot using a spatula. (Note, the custard will start to thicken suddenly, like a switch was flipped. So you should keep a close eye on it.)
Remove the pot from the stove immediately. Add the butter and vanilla extract. Stir to mix well.
Line a large deep plate with plastic wrap. Place a large mesh strainer on top.
Pour the custard into the lined plate over the strainer to smooth out the texture. Use a spatula to press the strainer if any lumps remain.
Cover the custard with plastic wrap. Press the wrap against the custard, so it won’t form a skin once it’s chilled.
Chill the custard in the fridge until it’s cooled completely, 2 hours or so. Or in the freezer for 30 mins.
Prepare the mooncake dough
Prepare a large bowl that can fit into your steamer. Place a large strainer on top.
In another medium-sized bowl, add the glutinous rice flour, rice flour, and cornstarch. Mix well with a fork.
Line a large mesh strainer over the bowl and sift the confectioner's sugar through it. Use your fingers or a spoon to press the sugar through if any lumps exist.
Add the milk, oil, and vanilla extract into a small bowl. Stir to mix well.
Use your fork to form a hole in the middle of the flour. Add 2 to 3 tablespoons of the milk mixture at a time. Stir until the liquid is incorporated into the flour completely. Repeat the process until it forms a very runny batter.
Pour the mixture into the large bowl (you prepared in step 1) over the strainer. Press the lumps using a spoon. Once strained, the mixture will thicken a little bit.
Prepare a steamer by pouring 1 inch (2.5 cof water into the steamer pot. Cover and heat over medium-high heat until boiling. Place the bowl with the batter into the steamer rack. Place the rack over the boiling pot. Cover and steam until the batter is cooked completely, 15 to 20 minutes. After 15 minutes, examine the dough by inserting a spoon into the middle. The spoon should come out clean, and the dough should feel very stiff.
Once done, remove the lid, and transfer the steaming rack with the bowl onto your kitchen counter to cool off for a few minutes.
Fold a kitchen towel a few times and place it on your working surface. Remove the bowl with the dough wearing oven mitts, and transfer the bowl onto the towel.
Scrape the dough from the bowl and knead it using a spoon, until it forms a dough ball, 5 minutes or so.
Transfer the dough onto a clean surface. Note, do not add any flour onto the surface or dust your hands with it. Knead the dough using your hands until it’s smooth, 5 minutes or so. The dough will soften once done.
Wrap the dough with plastic wrap and chill it in the fridge for 30 minutes.
Ingredient storage
You can keep the dough and the custard filling refrigerated for a couple of hours, up to overnight, until ready to assemble. The dough will become a bit stiff if you chill it overnight. If you want the freshest taste, you should assemble the mooncakes the same day you make the dough and filling.
Assemble the mooncakes
Form the custard into balls - Measure 25 grams of filling (about 1 round tablespooand use your hands to press and roll, until it forms a ball. You can wear rubber gloves to help with this process.
Transfer the filling balls into a container and cover it with the lid. Chill for another 30 minutes.
Form the dough into balls - Measure 25 grams of dough (about 1 round tablespooand use your hands to roll it into a ball. Place the dough balls into a container and cover. Chill in the fridge until the custard is ready to use.
Place the dough ball on a clean working surface. Use a rolling pin to roll it into an even, thin, round disc that is about 4” (9 to 10 cin diameter. Carefully remove it from the surface onto your palm.
Place a custard ball in the center of the wrapper. Use your other hand to gather the wrapper onto the top of the custard filling. The dough sheet will start to form pleats and create a thicker layer. Try to pinch the extra dough together using your fingers, and pinch off the dough. The process will keep the mooncake skin even and thin, to create a better mouthfeel. Once done, place the mooncake onto a plate, pleated-side-down. Loosely cover it with plastic wrap to prevent them from drying out. Repeat the process to wrap the rest of the mooncakes.
To mold the mooncakes
Install the pattern plate into the mooncake mold, with the pattern side facing downward. If you’re using the round shape, you can twist the lever of the mold so the pattern plate will snap onto the lever. It’s not required but it makes the process a bit easier.
Dust the mooncake with a very thin layer of cornstarch. (*Footnote 1)
Carefully place the wrapped mooncake balls into the mold, smooth surface against the pattern plate.
Place the mold onto a clean, flat surface. Gently press the lever until the dough is against your table surface. Hold it for at least 30 seconds. It will help the pattern to form. Once done, push the lever to release the mooncake. Repeat the process to mold all the mooncakes.
The mooncakes are ready to eat!
Storage
Transfer the mooncakes into an airtight container. Store them in the fridge for 3 to 4 days. To enjoy the mooncakes with a better texture, transfer them to your kitchen counter and wait for them to return to room temperature. You can eat the chilled mooncakes, but the skin will be a bit stiff.
Note, do not freeze the mooncakes. This will change the texture of the custard and make it very grainy.",en-US,4.84,,Omnivore's Cookbook,330,25 serving(s),137 kcal,25.1 g,2.4 g,3 g,1.6 g,48 mg,25 mg,10.3 g,1 mooncake (45 grams),0.5 g,

Microwave the kabocha squash for 2 to 3 minutes, so it’ll be much easier to cut. Halve the kabocha by tilting your knife to a 45-degree angle and slicing it down from the bottom of the squash (the softer part). Then cut to 1-inch thick slices.
Prepare a steamer with 2 inches of water in it. Top with steaming rack, and place the pumpkin on the rack. Cook covered over medium high heat until it reaches a boil and steam comes out from the lid. Steam until the squash turns tender throughout, about 15 minutes.
Transfer the kabocha to a plate and let cool for 15 minutes, until it can be handled by hand. Peel off the skin with a knife and discard. Measure 3 heaping cups (400 grams) of kabocha and transfer to a blender (I used Vitamix).
Add the butter, heavy cream, milk, brown sugar, eggs, butter, ginger, cinnamon, and salt into the blender. Turn on low spead and gradually increase to high. Blend until it forms a silky puree, 15 to 20 seconds. The puree should have a consistency thick enough to coat a spoon. You can add more milk if the texture is too thick, or add more squash if it’s too runny.
Layer a few dish towels on your kitchen counter. Drop the blender bowl from a 2-inch height onto the dish towels a few times, to release the bubbles that have formed in the puree. Transfer into a big bowl. The puree can be made a day earlier and stored in an airtight container in the fridge.
Bake
Sprinkle a thin layer of flour onto a clean working surface and place the pie dough on top. Let rest for 5 to 10 minutes, until it’s soft enough to roll out without cracking.
Dust the top of the pie dough and your rolling pin with flour. Roll out the dough into a round sheet that is about 1/8-inch (3-mm) thick, and 1-inch larger than the rim of your pie pan. Rotate the dough frequently so it won’t stick to the surface. Dust with more flour if needed.
Roll the dough over your rolling pin and unroll it over the baking dish. Gently arrange the dough to fit the pan. Trim off the excess dough with scissors, leaving about 1/2 inch (1-cm) from the rim of the baking pan.
Tuck the edge of the dough underneath so it creates a thick border that rests on the rim of the baking dish. Crimp the edges by pressing the edge with your finger while holding the two sides with the knuckles of your other hand.
Cover the dough with plastic wrap and transfer to the fridge. Let rest for 30 minutes to 1 hour, until it’s completely cooled and turns solid.
Adjust oven racks, so one is in the middle and one is on the bottom. Place a pizza stone on the bottom rack (Optional). Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 C).
Beat the egg with 1 tablespoon water in a small bowl to make an egg wash.
When the pie is well chilled, transfer to the kitchen counter. Crumple a piece of parchment paper and flatten it, cover the bottom of the pie and arrange it so it fits the shape. Add pie weights, beans, or rice onto the parchment paper. Transfer the pie onto the pizza stone. Turn the oven to 400 F (200 C). Bake for 30 minutes, or until the edges turn golden.
(Optional) If you made the pie garnish, you can now place them on the middle rack and bake until the surface turns golden, 15 to 17 minutes.
Transfer the pie crust to the kitchen counter and remove the pie weights. Brush the entire pie crust surface with a thin layer of egg wash. Return it to the bottom of the oven and bake for another 5 to 7 minutes, until the egg wash has dried completely and the bottom of the pie crust turns solid. If you plan to make the pie in advance, you can pre-bake the pie crust one day in advance.
Let the pie crust cool completely. Turn the oven to 350 F (176 C).
Fill the pie with the kabocha squash puree, up to 3/4 of the crust. Bake on the middle rack until the filling sets and the center jiggles slightly, about 40 minutes. Transfer the pie to a cooling rack and let cool completely before serving.

Combine the minced ginger and hot water in a small bowl. Stir to mix well and set aside.
Prepare the dough
In a large tall plate or a big bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, cornstarch, instant yeast and sugar. Stir to mix well.
Slowly pour in the warm water, a few tablespoons at a time, and mix with a pair of chopsticks (or a fork). Once all the water has been added, keep mixing and scrape off the dry flour on the side of the bowl, until it forms many small dough flakes.
Pour in the vegetable oil. Keep mixing with the chopsticks until the oil is absorbed.
Start kneading by hand while further incorporating the dry flour, until there’s no dry flour left in the bowl.
Transfer the dough onto a working surface. Knead for 15 to 20 minutes, until the dough is quite smooth and elastic and there’s no dry flour left in the bowl. It’s OK if there’s some unevenness in the dough, which will smooth out after resting. The dough should be quite tough and not sticky to the touch. Cover and seal the bowl with plastic wrap. Let rest until it doubles in size, 1 hour or so.
Prepare the filling
Add the ginger water, light and dark soy sauce, Shaoxing wine, salt, sugar, and white pepper to the ground pork in a large bowl. Beat with a pair of chopsticks or a wooden spatula in a circular motion, until all the liquid is absorbed and the meat is sticky. This process might take a few minutes. (*Footnote 4)
Add the green onions and sesame oil. Mix until they are incorporated. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Store in the fridge until ready to use.
Assemble the buns
When the dough has rested, transfer to a work surface and punch it down. Knead for 1 minute to deflate the air out completely, then form it back into a ball.
Cut the dough in half. Wrap half of the dough in plastic wrap and store in the fridge while working on the other half.
Poke a hole in the center of the dough you’re working with. Stretch the dough into a large oval by running your fingers along the inside of the hole in a circular motion. Once the diameter of the dough is about 1” (2.5 cm), tear apart the ring so it creates a long, thin strip.
Cut the dough strip into 12 even pieces by cutting it in half, then further cut each half into 6 pieces. Gently use a circular motion to round up each dough piece then flatten it with your palm. Cover them with plastic wrap to prevent drying out.
Work on one piece of dough at a time - take one dough piece and place in front of you. Roll it with a rolling pin in one hand, using the other hand to rotate the dough while rolling, until the diameter reaches 5” (13 cm). You should keep the edges thinner than the center, so the wrapper of the bun will be even once you make the pleats.
Place the rolled dough in your palm and add 1 tablespoon of filling in the center.
Start wrapping the bun by folding and pinching the edge over itself, in one direction, until it is almost sealed. Then rotate and pinch the top of the pleats to fully seal the bun. (View my video for more details)
Repeat with the remaining dough pieces to wrap all the buns. Keep the wrapped buns under a piece of plastic wrap to prevent drying out. Once done wrapping, let rest for 10 minutes. Once rested, you should cook the buns immediately. You can store the wrapped buns in a sealed container in the fridge for up to 1 hour before cooking.
Repeat the wrapping steps to wrap the other half of the dough.
To cook the buns:
Add 2 tablespoons of oil and carefully place 12 wrapped buns into a 9” or 10” skillet. Heat over medium-high heat until hot. Turn to medium heat. Cook, uncovered, for 3 minutes, until the bottoms are lightly browned.
Pour about 1/4 cup hot water into the pan, just enough to cover the buns halfway up. Cover the pan and cook over medium heat for about 8 minutes, until the water is completely evaporated.
Turn the heat to medium-low and cook for another 2 to 3 minutes. Turn the heat off and remove the pan from the stove. Let the buns rest with the lid on for an additional 2 minutes. Remove the lid and transfer to a plate. Repeat the steps to cook the rest of the buns.

Soak the red beans in water for 2 to 3 hours, then rinse off and drain.
Add the soaked red beans, 3 ¾ cups water, and baking soda to a medium pot. Cover and bring to a boil, then immediately reduce the heat to a simmer until the beans are softened and opened-up (about 30 minutes). Stir periodically to avoid burning.
If you see a lot of liquid remaining even after the beans are softened and have opened up, turn up the heat, remove the lid, and let the liquid cook off. While you’re doing this, watch the beans closely and stir occasionally to avoid burning. Remove from the heat and let the beans cool for a bit before pureeing the cooked beans in a food processor. You can also use an immersion blender, but a food processor will result in a more even puree.
Put the red bean puree in a thick-bottomed pan set over medium-high heat, and cook off the liquid, stirring constantly. This process will take about 25 to 30 minutes. Add the sugar (about 1/2 cup or to taste) early in the cooking process so it has a chance to fully dissolve.
Towards the end of the cooking time, add the ¼ cup of vegetable oil in two batches. The oil will prevent the puree from sticking to the pan too much. The paste is done once it “stays” in place rather than oozing across the pan. Transfer the paste to a dish, and let it cool before storing it in the refrigerator, covered.
The Night Before: Soak the Rice and Bamboo Leaves:
Rinse the sweet rice a couple of times until the water runs clear rather than cloudy. Next, transfer the rice to a large bowl with enough water so that the water line is ½-inch above the rice. Stir in 1½ tablespoons of lye water and ½ tablespoon vegetable oil. Once the lye water hits the fresh water, both the rice and water will turn a light yellow color––that’s normal. Soak the rice, covered, in the refrigerator overnight.
In a large basin (or your kitchen sink), soak the bamboo leaves overnight. Weigh the leaves down with something heavy to make sure all of the leaves are submerged.
The Next Day: Making and Cooking the Zongzi:
Clean each bamboo leaf, front and back, with a clean kitchen towel, shaking off any excess water and trimming off about a half inch of the bamboo leaf at the base (this part is too tough and rigid to handle). Set aside.
Take the soaked rice out of the refrigerator, and drain off all of the liquid. Set it aside.
Take out the red bean paste, and divide it into 15 equal-sized balls.
Now you’re ready to assemble the zongzi! Take two bamboo leaves and follow the steps shown in the photos, tying them off with kitchen string. Each rice dumpling takes about 2 tablespoons of soaked rice and one portion of red bean paste. Just remember not to tie the string too snugly, as the rice will need room to expand during the cooking process. After unwrapping a zongzi, it shouldn’t look like it has been wearing a pair of pants that’s two sizes too small. :)
In a large pot, arrange the zongzi neatly, and fill the pot with water--about 1-inch above the top of the zongzi. Add 1 ½ teaspoon of lye water to the pot, and place a heat-proof bowl or plate on top of everything to weigh down the zongzi. Bring the water to a boil, and then turn the heat to medium to slow cook the zongzi for 2½ hours. Check the water levels periodically, replenishing the pot with boiling water when the waterline falls below the top of zongzi.
After 2 ½ hours, turn off the heat, and take out the zongzi to let them cool. Serve the zongzi at room temperature with sugar or the syrup of your choice!",en-US,5.0,,The Woks of Life,360,15 serving(s),229 kcal,42 g,5 g,4 g,3 g,,43 mg,7 g,1 serving,3 g,

Stir to dissolve the sugar. Once it’s boiled, add the lemon juice, stir, and immediately turn the heat down to low. Keep the lid off, and let the syrup simmer for about 60 to 70 minutes until the sugary liquid turns a light amber color. Do not stir during this time frame! By now, the liquid might look too watery, but it will thicken once it’s cooled. Try not to overcook it, because it will become thick like caramel (it should be the consistency of honey). Just in case you do overcook the syrup, and it’s too thick, add a few drops of hot water to thin it out. Keep adding the hot water until you get the right consistency. Now pour the sugary liquid into a heatproof container, and let it cool completely before storing it in the refrigerator.
Making the Lotus Paste: Using a butter knife, gently split the lotus seeds in half through the top opening. Remove and discard the green center. Wash and soak them overnight. The next day, wash and drain the lotus seeds. In a pot, add the lotus seeds and 4 cups of water (the water level should be above the lotus seeds). Bring the mixture to a boil over high heat. Once the water reaches a boil, turn the heat to low, and let the seeds simmer for 30 minutes. It’s done once the lotus seeds are softened but have maintained their shape. Turn off the heat, let cool, and then drain the liquid. In a food processor, puree the cooked lotus seeds (it’s best to do this in two batches). Transfer the lotus puree to a non-stick pan (or a cast-iron pan, or a pan with a thick bottom to avoid sticking and burning). Turn the heat to medium low, and stir/flip/turn the puree using a rubber spatula non-stop for about 30 minutes (nice to have the TV or an audiobook on as you're doing this). In between, add in the powdered sugar and oil in 3 alternating batches. With each batch, make sure the sugar and oil is well incorporated before adding more. The lotus filling is done once the lotus paste is slightly firmer/can hold its shape. Let it cool completely before storing in the refrigerator in an airtight container. You can make this one day ahead of time, and I found that it’s easier to work with when the filling has been chilled.
Making the salted duck egg yolks: There are a couple of ways to go about preparing the salted duck egg yolk: The ones I bought are already cooked, so they were ready to use, and you can buy the same. But I did find them to be slightly drier than I would normally like. You can also buy whole cooked salted duck eggs, and extract the whole yolk. You can buy raw salted duck eggs, crack the eggs open, and take out the yolks. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Dip each yolk in baijiu (白酒, a clear Chinese liquor made from grain), just briefly to coat it, then put the egg yolks on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake for 8 minutes, let them cool completely, and they are ready to use. You can also prepare this ahead of time...just make sure to store them in an airtight container and in the fridge.
Making the dough: First mix the sugar syrup, oil, and lye water together. Then add the mixture to the flour, and use a rubber spatula to fold and combine everything into a soft dough. Do not overwork the dough--this step should only take about a minute or two. Cover the dough in an airtight container or wrap in plastic wrap. Let it rest in the refrigerator for an hour. Chilled dough is much easier to work with. (Side note: you may also leave the dough in the refrigerator overnight if you'd like to make it ahead of time.)
Assembling the mooncakes: While the dough is resting, let’s start assembling the filling. My mooncake mold was marked 100 grams, which means each mooncake should weigh about 100 grams after assembly. This recipe makes 18 mooncakes total: 12 mooncakes with salted duck egg yolks and 6 mooncakes without. Separately weigh out twelve 58-gram scoops of lotus filling and six 70-gram scoops of lotus filling. Shape each portion of filling into balls. Next, take one of the 58 gram lotus balls, make a deep well in the middle, and insert one salted duck egg yolk into the middle. Then close the top and re-shape it into a ball. Repeat for the remaining 11 pieces. It’s good to separate the “with” and the “without.” It’s also a good idea to put them back into the refrigerator, covered, until you are ready to assemble the rest of the mooncakes. Once the dough has finished resting, it’s time to prepare the mooncake mold. My mooncake mold came with four pattern plates––one plate should be attached to the mold itself. Wrap another one with clear plastic, because we will use it to press the mooncake from the bottom;, Now dust the inside of the mold with plenty of flour and shake off the excess. You’ll need to repeat this process before pressing every mooncake to avoid sticking. Divide and weigh the dough into eighteen 25-gram pieces, plus 1 smaller dough ball for scraps/mending, which I will get to. Shape each piece into a ball. Lightly dust the dough balls with flour. Take one dough ball and roll it out on a lightly floured surface into a 4-inch round. Put one piece of filling in the center. Carefully lift it up and turn it upside down, and gently press out the air bubbles around the lotus ball, without breaking the dough. Now turn the opening facing up, and slowly press the dough together to close the opening, keeping the distribution of the dough as even as possible. The dough feels like Play-doh, so it’s easy to break, but it’s also easy to squish back together. These instructions might sound confusing, but follow along with the pictures and keep in mind that the chief goal here is to close the dough around the filling without capturing air inside. Now lightly dust the assembled ball with additional flour. Place it inside the mooncake mold with the mold opening facing up. Now press in the bottom piece (with the clear plastic-wrapped plate that you prepared). With some pressure, gently press it inward. Quickly sit the mold down, and press the mooncake out with the top pressure bar. The bottom piece will come out no problem, but use your other hand to VERY GENTLY guide the mooncake out of the mold. When and if a small piece of dough gets stuck and does not come out, get a small piece of the “scrap”/“mending” dough to patch up the area. Then clean the mold and dust it well with flour again. Then gently flatten all sides of the mooncake to make it smaller, so it can go back in the mooncake mold for re-shaping. Use slightly more flour for dusting if this becomes a persistent issue. Place the mooncakes on a baking sheet as you make them.
Baking the mooncakes: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees when you are almost finished assembling the mooncakes. Once the oven is preheated, gently mist the mooncakes with a food-grade spray bottle (if you have one) filled with water. But since I didn’t have one, I just used my fingers, and it worked fine! Dip your fingers into a bowl of water, and fling the water on your fingers onto the mooncakes a couple of times. This prevents the dough from cracking. Then, immediately put the mooncakes in the oven and bake for 5 minutes. (Remember to set the timer!) Now prepare the egg wash by whisking the egg yolk and water together. After the mooncakes have been baking for 5 minutes, take them out of the oven and immediately lower the oven temperature to 300 degrees. Now lightly brush each mooncake with egg wash, and put them back in the oven. Bake them for another 15 minutes and remember to set the timer. When the time has elapsed, take them out and let them cool completely.
When the mooncakes first come out of the oven, the dough looks dry like bread, and not oily like what you are used to when opening packaged mooncakes. This is normal. Store the cooled mooncakes in an airtight container for a day or two, and the outside will get that nice shiny sheen that you recognize and love.
After this last step, any uneaten mooncakes can be kept in the refrigerator for a week or two.",en-US,4.85,,The Woks of Life,840,18 serving(s),308 kcal,51 g,6 g,9 g,2 g,141 mg,16 mg,29 g,1 serving,1 g,

Drain the soaked beans and transfer the red beans and mung beans to two separate pots. Add 3 cups of fresh water to each.
Bring both pots to a boil. For the red adzuki bean mixture, reduce the heat and simmer for 1 hour. It depends a little bit on the soaking time and the age of the beans. For the green mung bean soup, simmer for 20-30 minutes, until the beans are tender and breaking open.
When the beans look soft and broken down, use an immersion blender to blend just ½ cup of each bean soup into a puree. Then add the puree back to the pots. Cool completely before using. I made mine one day ahead of time and let it chill overnight. If you do this, you may need to loosen the red bean mixture with some water the next day, as the adzuki beans can be quite starchy.
Prepare Ice for Shaving
Freeze ice in molds that came with your ice shaving machine.
Prepare Toppings
Cook the tapioca pearls in separate small pots per package instructions. For the dried white tapioca pearls, use these instructions. The white tapioca pearls can be slightly tricky to cook, but the black tapioca pearls (the ones in the packages that say, “Ready in 5 Minutes”) cook quickly, so feel free to only use those if you prefer.
Prepare the glutinous rice balls per our recipe. We had some set aside in the freezer, so all we had to do was boil them and cool them under running water.
Next, prepare the milk mixture by mixing the 3 milks together. You can opt to use all coconut milk, or all dairy milk if you prefer one over the other. As for the condensed milk, this is where most of the sweetness comes from, and the thicker the milk mixture, the better it’ll be over the ice.
Assemble the Shaved Ice
Shave the ice and heap it into a big tower in a shallow bowl. You may need to shave the ice into a smaller bowl than what you’ll serve it in. If you need to move ice around, just be sure to move quickly!
Using a spoon, drip the red bean and mung bean mixtures down the sides of the ice tower in alternating columns. Then, place the boba, tapioca, and glutinous rice balls around the base of the ice tower. Finally, pour the milk mixture over the top, letting it soak into the ice and flow down the sides.
One serving of this shaved ice takes about 1 cup of shaved ice, as much of the bean mixtures and toppings as you want, and ½-⅔ cup milk. Go by your own preferences and build them how you like!",en-US,5.0,,The Woks of Life,810,4 serving(s),,,,,,,,,,,

Then you can make the dough. While the filling cools, sift together the sweet rice flour, cornstarch, and caster sugar in a mixing bowl.

To make dough:
In a large mixing bowl, combine the powdered sugar, milk, and oil. Sift in 50g glutinous (sweet) rice flour, 35g rice flour, and 35g wheat starch. Stir and mix well until there are no lumps.
Pour the dough mixture into a heat-proof bowl that will fit in your steamer. Cover it with clear plastic wrap, and let it rest on the counter for 30 minutes.
Prepare a steamer by filling it with enough water to steam on high heat for 25 minutes. Place the rested dough (still in the heatproof bowl) into your steamer while the water in the steamer is still cold. Keep the plastic wrap on the dough as it steams to protect it from condensation. Do keep the plastic wrap away from the hot sides of the steamer.
Place the steamer over high heat, cover, and steam for 25 minutes. The dough is cooked once it has turned from fully opaque to fully translucent. A little oil floating to the top is normal. If the dough is not completely cooked through, just put the plastic wrap back on and steam for another 5 minutes over high heat.
Once the dough is done cooking, carefully stir it to gradually cool it down. Once cool enough to handle, put on your food prep gloves, and knead the dough for a few minutes to ensure the oil is well absorbed and the dough is smooth. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap, and chill in the refrigerator for 1-2 hours.
Cook the remaining 25g glutinous (sweet) rice flour in a clean, dry pan over medium low heat for 6-7 minutes, until it turns very lightly brown. Stir often to avoid burning, and set aside to cool completely. You’ll use this flour for dusting.
To assemble:
You should have about 400g of dough. The ideal dough to filling ratio is about 1:1. For a 50g mooncake mold, you’ll need 25g dough and 25g filling. Put on your food prep gloves, and weigh/divide the filling into portions that correspond to the size of your mooncake mold. Roll each portion of filling into a ball. Repeat the same step with the dough after chilling. A plastic dough cutter works well (it doesn’t stick to the dough), or you can just rip the dough apart with your gloved hands. The dough should be pliable and very easy to work with.
Lay a piece of clear plastic wrap on your work surface to prevent sticking. Take each dough ball, and press it into a round disc with your palm. For a 50g mooncake, the circle should be no bigger than 3 inches (7.5 cm) in diameter. For a 100g mooncake, the skin should be no bigger than 4 inches (10 cm) in diameter. If you’d like to use a rolling pin, the dough must be between two layers of plastic wrap to avoid sticking.
Place a ball of filling in the center of the dough circle, and carefully lift the whole thing up and turn it upside down. Gently press out the air bubbles around the filling ball.
Turn the opening face up, and slowly press the dough together to close the opening, keeping the dough as even as possible all around.
Dust the inside of the mooncake mold VERY well by brushing all the nooks and crannies with the cooked glutinous rice flour (AKA sweet rice flour). Mooncake molds have intricate designs where dough can get stuck, so it pays to make sure it’s well-floured. Shake off any excess flour, and carefully place the ball inside the mold. Do not force it in. If necessary, re-shape the mooncake ball so it can easily fit into the mold.
Flip the mooncake mold so the open side is facing down on the plastic wrap work surface. With slight pressure, gently press down the spring bar on the mold until you feel resistance. Lift the mold, gently press the spring bar (to push the mooncake out of the mold), and carefully guide (and catch) the mooncake out of the mold with your other hand.

When it’s completely thawed, use your hands to gently squeeze the water from it. Chop the leaves into small pieces. Set aside.
Prepare, the silken tofu by cutting it into ½-inch cubes. Set aside. It can be tricky to keep them in a cube shape since the silken tofu is delicate, so don’t worry if they aren’t perfect.
Heat the chicken stock in a medium pot or wok. Add the salt, sesame oil, and ground white pepper. Let everything come to a slow simmer.
Stir up your cornstarch and water mixture since the cornstarch settles at the bottom of the bowl when left standing. Turn the heat down, and use your metal hoak or soup ladle to stir the soup in a circular motion so the soup is moving and swirling. Slowly drizzle all of the cornstarch slurry into the soup while stirring. The trick to thickening the soup with cornstarch is to turn the heat down slightly and keep the soup moving so the cornstarch does not form clumps.
As you continue stirring, turn the heat back up to get the soup to a very low simmer. Check the soup for seasoning and add more salt if needed. Don’t worry if the soup tastes a little saltier than you’d like at this stage, because the Shepherd’s purse and the silken tofu are both unseasoned.
Simmer the soup for a minute, and add the chopped shepherd’s purse. Stir it gently until the leaves are well distributed.
Next, gently add the silken tofu cubes into the soup, and stir, taking care not to break up the tofu. You want to ensure that the tofu and shepherd’s purse are uniformly distributed in the soup and that both are heated evenly. The soup should start to simmer in about 2 to 4 minutes. At this point, you can add a bit more cornstarch slurry if you like a thicker soup, but keep in mind that the soup will thicken more as it cools.
Beat the egg whites briskly for about 10 seconds until the white is broken up and just starts to bubble.
Next, take your ladle or hoak and move it in a wide, steady swirling motion around the perimeter of the pot or wok until the soup is moving. Slowly drizzle the egg white into the soup.
At this point, adjust the heat so the soup is simmering. Taste the soup again, and season to taste with salt, white pepper, and sesame oil if needed. (Sesame oil and especially white pepper enhances the taste of the Shepherd’s purse, so you can add more or simply put these condiments on the table so they can be added as needed.)

We used lotus paste.
Make sesame ball dough. Place 1/2 cup (60g) glutinous rice flour and sugar in a bowl. Pour ¼ cup (60g) of boiling water into the flour and sugar. Mix with a rubber spatula until smooth. Let sit for 5 minutes. Add ¼ cup + 1 tablespoon (70g) room temperature water and the rest of the glutinous flour (1 cup, 120g). Mix with a spatula until it forms a dough, and all the flour has been incorporated. Cover with an overturned plate or put it in a reusable silicone bag. Set aside to rest for 30 minutes.
Prepare your sesame seeds by pouring them in a fine-meshed strainer and rinsing them until they're completely soaked. Let the excess water drain and place the sesame seeds on a plate. Spread them out evenly with enough space for rolling the sesame balls. You can use a paper towel if the sesame seeds are very wet. They should be moist, but not dripping wet.
Your filling should be half the weight of your dough ball. Use your kitchen scale to measure out 8 pieces of lotus or red bean paste that weigh 24g each. Roll them into balls and set aside.
Weigh the dough ball on a digital kitchen scale – it should weigh about 370 to 380 grams. Whatever your weight is, divide it by 8 to get the weight for each dough ball (in our case, we got 47g). Using the kitchen scale, separate the dough into 8 equal pieces, and roll them into balls. Set them aside on a plate, and cover them so they don’t dry out.
To assemble, flatten the dough ball until it is 3 inches in diameter – the middle should be slightly thicker. Place 1 ball of filling in the center of the dough, wrapping the dough around the ball. Pinch the dough together so it covers all the filling, making the thickness of the dough as even as possible. You can pinch excess dough from the point where the sesame ball is sealed to fill empty spots or reinforce areas that look thin.
After the filling is completely covered, gently press it all together to form a ball, rolling it between the palms of your hands until the seams disappear, and you form a uniform round ball.
Roll the ball in the moistened sesame seeds until the entire ball is thoroughly covered. Roll the ball again in your hands to press the sesame seeds into the dough and place on parchment paper until they are ready to deep-fry.
Heat 4 cups of peanut or canola oil in a medium deep pot to a stable 320°F/160°C. (Use a thermometer for accuracy, as achieving the right oil temperature is extremely important.) The oil should fill the pot about halfway.
Add 4 sesame balls into the oil, and immediately use a slotted spoon to gently move them in a circular motion so they do not stick to the pot. This is a necessary step throughout the entire process to ensure even frying. Don’t leave them unattended. Adding the sesame balls will lower the oil temperature down below 300°F/150°C, but shouldn’t take it below 290°F/143°C. Adjust the heat slightly higher or lower to maintain the oil temperature at 300°F/150°C.
After 10 minutes, your sesame balls will begin to float to the top of the oil. Now, your technique changes to keep them rolling in the oil so all sides get the same frying time. You can also occasionally press all four sesame balls down using a slotted spoon or small spider to keep them submerged in the oil. Do this for 2-3 minutes.
At this stage, increase the heat to bring the oil temperature gradually up to 350°F. Fry them for another 5 minutes, for a total of 17-18 minutes, or until they turn a light golden brown. This last stage of frying at a higher temperature browns them. The sesame balls will expand and grow slightly at this higher oil temperature. The outer crust is now strong enough such that they should not burst, as long as you don’t have any weak or thin spots in the dough.
Transfer the finished sesame balls to a strainer, cooling rack or plate lined with paper towels for the oil to drain. Repeat with the second batch. Cool for 10 minutes and serve.",en-US,4.92,,The Woks of Life,120,8 serving(s),283 kcal,49 g,4 g,8 g,1 g,,1 mg,20 g,1 serving,2 g,

Add 2 cups of water and the ginger to a medium-sized pot, bring it a boil, then let it simmer for 10 minutes over low to medium heat with the lid covered. Turn off the heat, and stir in the brown sugar and allspice until the sugar is dissolved completely. Remove the ginger slices. Now add 1 1/2 cups of cold water to cool down the mixture so its warm, not hot.
In a large mixing bowl, mix the two kinds of flours together and then slowly add in the sugar water mixture. Stir thoroughly until the batter is smooth (without any lumps). Now stir in the vanilla extract, molasses, orange zest, and 2 teaspoons of vegetable oil until thoroughly combined. The resulting batter should have a consistency similar to condensed milk. If the batter is too thick, add a bit more water a couple tablespoons at a time until the desired consistency is reached.
Pour the batter evenly into two foil pans. Gently tap the pans against your countertop to get rid of air bubbles. Top each pan with three decorative dates in the center, if using. Put both pans in a double-decker bamboo steamer and steam for about 1 hour on high heat (the water should be boiling, but should NOT be bubbling high enough to touch the foil pans). You might need to add water into the steamer midway to avoid having the water dry up and burn your bamboo steamers.
After 1 hour, poke a toothpick into the rice cake. It’s done if the toothpick comes out clean--just like a regular cake! Regarding steaming techniques, for this recipe and in general, it doesn’t matter what type of vessel you use. The core goal here is to use steam to cook the food, which means it's important that the steam doesn't escape.
For example, if you use bamboo steamer, you will also need a pot that fits the bamboo steamer perfectly so there is no visible steam escaping. If you don’t have a pot that fits the bamboo steamer, you will need to put the bamboo steamer inside a much larger pot with a lid and set the bamboo steamer on a rack above the water.

Grease and flour a 9-inch round springform pan. You can also use an 8-inch square pan, but the pan should not have a dark non-stick coating, or it’s likely it will burn.
Add the room temperature butter, sugar, and vanilla extract to the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Beat on medium speed until light and fluffy, 1 minute. If your coconut oil is solid, add it at the same time as the butter. If it’s liquid, add it after the butter and sugar have had a chance to cream together.
The mixture may be a little separated if you are using liquid rather than solid coconut oil. That’s okay. Scrape the sides of the bowl, and then add the eggs one at a time, beating well with each addition. It should be golden in color and thickly emulsified. Mix in the osmanthus syrup. Give the bowl another scrape to make sure everything is mixed evenly.
In a separate bowl, whisk together the almond flour, self-rising flour, and salt. Turn the mixer speed to low, and gradually add the dry ingredients in three batches.

Grease a 9-inch springform pan and wrap the bottom in foil. You’re going to be putting the cheesecake in a water bath, and you don’t want the water to seep into the pan from the bottom.
Break up the graham crackers into smaller pieces and put them in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse until they’ve turned into crumbs. Add the melted butter and process again until the mixture resembles wet sand. Press evenly into the bottom of the springform pan, packing the graham cracker crumbs down as tightly as you can.
In the bowl of a mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, add the cream cheese and mix on low speed until creamy. Add the sugar and mix on low speed until smooth. Blend in the milk on low speed as well. Add in the eggs one at a time, mixing just until incorporated. Then mix in the sour cream, vanilla, lemon zest, and flour. You don't want to over-mix or allow too much air into the mixture.
Pour the filling into the prepared crust. Tap the pan against the counter a few times to get rid of any air bubbles, and place it in a rimmed baking sheet filled with 1 cm of water.
Transfer the entire apparatus to the oven and bake for 30 minutes. Do not open the oven door! After 30 minutes has elapsed, turn the oven off, and let the cheesecake cool in oven with the door closed for 3 hours to prevent cracking. Chill in the refrigerator.
Meanwhile, make the strawberry sauce. In a small saucepan, add the jam, water, and sugar. Bring to a simmer, stirring frequently. Simmer for 3 minutes, until the sugar is completely dissolved. (If you want your sauce really red, you can add in a couple drops of red food coloring.)
Dissolve the cornstarch into the lemon juice, and pour it into the pot, whisking constantly. Simmer until the syrup is bubbly, but no longer foamy. Remove the syrup from the heat, and allow to cool. Stir in the strawberries.

Turn the mixer on to the lowest setting to bring the dough together. Knead on low speed for 15 minutes. If needed, turn off the mixer to bring the dough together with a rubber spatula.
The dough should not stick to the sides of the mixer, but it may look a little bit sticky (sticking to the bottom of the mixer is ok). If you’re in a humid climate, and the dough is sticking to the sides of the mixing bowl, add more flour 1 tablespoon at a time until it comes together. Alternatively, you can stir all the dough ingredients together with a wooden spoon in a large mixing bowl, and then knead by hand for 20 minutes.
Shape the dough into a ball, and cover the bowl with an overturned plate or damp towel. Place in a warm spot to proof for 75-90 minutes, or until the dough doubles in size. (A good proofing environment is a closed microwave, with a mug of hot boiled water next to the bowl.)
While that's happening, mix the filling. In a medium bowl, combine the coconut, milk powder, sugar, salt, melted butter, egg yolks, and milk. Set aside.
After the first proof, knead for another 5 minutes to punch the air out of it. Then dump the dough on a lightly floured surface, shape it into a ball, and cut it in half. Cut each half of dough into 6 pieces, so you get 12 equal pieces of dough.
To shape the buns, knead and roll piece of dough into an even ball, and flatten. Roll into a 5x10 inch rectangle. Spread a layer of filling onto the rectangle, pressing the filling into the dough and leaving about a half inch of margin all around.
Roll the dough lengthwise into a cigar. Cut the cigar in half lengthwise, leaving it attached at the top end, so it looks like a long pair of pants. Twist the two pieces together, and then roll into a round spiral/snail shape, tucking the ends underneath the bun. Place onto a parchment-lined baking sheet. You’ll need two baking sheets, with 6 buns on each.
Cover with a damp towel, and proof the buns for 1 hour. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 degrees, and position a rack in the middle of the oven.

Melt the butter in a large non-stick skillet over medium low heat. While we’re not a huge fan of non-stick cookware, it makes this recipe (and clean-up) much easier.
Add the marshmallows, and stir until melted (about 3 to 4 minutes).Once the marshmallows and butter are melted together, turn down the heat to low and immediately stir in the vanilla extract, toasted nuts, pistachios (or pumpkin seeds) and cranberries.
Add the crackers, breaking any larger pieces as you stir them. Use a folding motion to mix and stir the entire mixture until everything is uniformly coated. Do not compress the mixture together when stirring.

Add the caster sugar and use a spatula to mix together in the food processor a bit. Then add the butter and pulse for 10 seconds at a time until the mixture is well combined. Scoop everything out into a bowl and put in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. The purpose of this cooling process is to harden the mixture slightly for easy handling later.
While the filling is cooling, make the dough. Put the sweet rice flour into a mixing bowl. Slowly add in the warm water, while stirring to form a dough. The dough can’t be too wet, or it will not hold its shape. Cover with a damp towel.
Now boil some water in a small pot, take out a small piece of the dough, about 1” in diameter. Add it to the boiling water and cook the piece of dough until it floats. Scoop it out and add it to the rest of the dough. Mix the two parts together until the dough is soft and smooth. Divide the dough into 12 equal pieces (about 18 grams each, if you want to be really exacting), and roll them into balls. Keep the dough and dough balls covered with a damp paper towel while assembling.
Take out the filling after it’s cooled for 30 minutes. It should be slightly hard, but still workable. Roll the filling into small marble-sized balls, about 4 to 5 grams each. Then take each dough ball and flatten into a circle about 2 inches in diameter. Add the filling to the center, and close the dough over the filling. Roll the ball around in your hands until it's smooth and round. Repeat until all the sesame balls are made. Cover the remaining filling and return to the refrigerator for later!
While you are assembling, bring a medium pot of water to a boil. Add the sesame balls and stir immediately to prevent them from sticking. Adding the sesame balls will cool down the water temperature significantly, so once the water comes back up to a boil, add a 1/2 cup of water to the pot. Repeat this step two more times.

Heat the sugar and water in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir to dissolve the sugar. Once it’s boiling, add the lemon juice, stir, and immediately turn the heat down to low.
Keep the lid off, and let the syrup simmer for about 60 to 70 minutes until the sugary liquid turns a light amber color. Do not stir during this timeframe! By now, the liquid might look too watery, but it will thicken once it’s cooled. Try not to overcook it, because it will become thick like caramel. (Just in case you do overcook the syrup, and it’s too thick, add a few drops of hot water to thin it out. Keep adding the hot water until you get the right consistency.)
Now, pour the syrup into a heatproof container, and cool completely before storing it in the refrigerator.
PART II: The dough
First, mix the inverted sugar syrup, oil, and lye water together. Then add the flour to the mixture, using a rubber spatula to fold and combine everything into a soft dough.
Do not overwork the dough. This step should only take about a minute or two. Cover the dough in an airtight container or wrap it in plastic wrap. Let it rest in the refrigerator for at least an hour to make it easier to work with. You can also refrigerate the dough overnight if you’d like to make it ahead of time.
PART III: The ham and nut filling
Steam the ham in a heatproof bowl for 15 minutes. You will end up with some liquid in the bowl after it’s done steaming. Save this liquid and set it aside. Finely chop the ham.
If you’re using pre-toasted nuts, you can save some time. If not, toast the raw nuts in a preheated oven at 325 degrees F for 5-10 minutes with each batch. Roast the walnuts, cashews, and pecans together, and roast the pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and sesame seeds in a separate batch. My tip is that once you smell a nutty aroma after 3-4 minutes, stand in front of the oven until the nuts are toasted to your liking. Don’t walk away from the oven, because the nuts can burn quickly! Once cool enough to handle, chop the walnuts, cashews, and pecans, and add them to a large mixing bowl along with the toasted pumpkin, sunflower, and sesame seeds.
In a clean, dry wok, toast the sweet rice flour for 15 to 20 minutes over medium low heat until it turns a light brown color. Stir often, and adjust the heat accordingly to prevent burning.
In a small pot, heat up the oil until it’s lightly smoking. Turn off the heat, and let it cool. Believe it or not, cooking the oil this way adds fragrance and flavor to the mooncakes!
To your mixing bowl full of chopped nuts and seeds, add the chopped ham, currants, sugar, salt, and five spice powder. Mix well. Now add in the liquids: the water from steaming the ham, the bai jiu, the “cooked” peanut oil, and the water. Stir everything to combine.
Lastly, slowly add in the toasted sweet rice flour to bind all the ingredients together. The final mixture should be somewhat dry and slightly crumbly, but you should be able to squeeze everything together tightly and form a ball. If you need to, add a little bit more peanut oil to moisten the mixture.
Weigh and divide the mixture into 18 equal pieces. Form each piece into a ball, and set aside for assembling the mooncakes.
Part IV: Assembling the mooncakes
After the dough is done resting, divide it into 18 equal pieces. My mooncake mold holds 100 grams, which means that each mooncake should weigh about 100 grams after assembly. You should be able to use these guidelines when assembling the mooncakes:
Each dough ball is around 25 to 30 grams. Set aside a smaller dough ball for scraps and mending, which I will get to. Shape each piece into a ball.
Each ball of filling should be around 65 to 70 grams.
Let’s start assembling the mooncakes by preparing the mooncake mold. My mooncake mold came with four pattern plates––one plate should be attached to the mold itself. Wrap another one with clear plastic, because you’ll use it to press the mooncake from the bottom. Now, dust the inside of the mold with plenty of flour, and shake off the excess. You’ll need to repeat this process before pressing every mooncake to avoid sticking.
Dust the balls of dough with flour. Take one ball of dough, and roll it out on a floured surface into a 4-inch round. Put one piece of filling in the center. Carefully lift it up (I use a dough cutter to scrape it up from my work surface), and gently press out the air bubbles without breaking the dough. Next, make sure the opening is facing up, and slowly pinch the dough closed around the filling, keeping the distribution of the dough as even as possible.
The dough feels like Play-doh, so it’s easy to break, but it’s also easy to squish back together. These instructions might sound confusing, but follow along with the pictures, and keep in mind that the chief goal here is to close the dough around the filling without any air pockets. Now dust the assembled ball with additional flour.
Place the ball of dough and filling inside the mooncake mold with the mold opening facing up. Next, press in the bottom piece (with the clear plastic-wrapped plate that you prepared). With some pressure, gently press it inward.
Quickly put the mold down, and press the mooncake out with the top pressure bar. The bottom piece will come out no problem, but use your other hand to VERY GENTLY guide the mooncake out of the mold. When/if a small piece of dough gets stuck and does not come out, get a small piece of your scrap dough to patch up the area. Then clean the mold, and dust it well with flour again. Next, gently flatten all sides of the mooncake to make it smaller, so it can go back in the mooncake mold for re-shaping. Use slightly more flour for dusting if this becomes a persistent issue. Place the mooncakes on a baking sheet as you make them.
PART V: Baking the mooncakes
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F, and put the baking rack in the middle of the oven when you’re almost finished assembling the mooncakes. Once the oven is preheated, gently mist the mooncakes with a food-grade spray bottle (if you have one) filled with water. If you don’t have one, you can just use your hands. Dip your fingers into a bowl of water, and fling the water on your fingers onto the mooncakes a couple of times. This prevents the dough from cracking in the hot oven.
Then, immediately put the mooncakes in the oven, and bake for 5 minutes. (Remember to set the timer!) Now, prepare the egg wash by whisking together an egg yolk with 3 tablespoons of water.
After the mooncakes have been baking for 5 minutes, take them out of the oven and immediately lower the oven temperature to 300 degrees. Using a natural-bristle pastry brush, lightly brush each mooncake with egg wash, and put them back in the oven.
Bake them for another 15 minutes (set a timer!). When the time has elapsed, take them out, and let them cool completely. When the mooncakes first come out of the oven, the dough will look dry like bread, and not oily like what you are used to when opening packaged mooncakes. This is normal.
Store the completely cooled mooncakes in an airtight container for a day or two, and the outside will get that sheen that you recognize and love.",en-US,5.0,,The Woks of Life,3000,18 serving(s),450 kcal,52 g,9 g,25 g,3 g,14 mg,182 mg,29 g,1 serving,3 g,

Using the dough hook attachment, turn the mixer on at the lowest setting. Let the dough come together for 15 minutes, occasionally pausing the mixer to push the dough together with a rubber spatula. If you're in a humid climate, and the dough is too sticky, feel free to add a little more flour 1 tablespoon at a time until it comes together. If you don't have a mixer and would like to knead by hand, extend the kneading time by at least 5-10 minutes.
After 15 minutes of mixing, the dough is ready for proofing. Cover the bowl with a damp towel and place in a warm spot for 1 hour. I proofed the dough in my oven (I had the oven on rapid proof for 5 minutes, turned the oven off, and then closed the oven door). The dough will grow to 1½ times its original size. (Just so you know, in some cases, readers have reported that their proofing takes slightly longer than 1 hour.)
In the meantime, prepare 16 4” x 4” pieces of parchment paper and a large baking sheet.
After the dough finishes proofing, put the dough back in the mixer, and stir for another 5 minutes to get rid of any air bubbles.
Dump the dough onto a lightly floured surface, and cut into 16 equal pieces. To assemble the buns, follow the photos. Roll each piece of dough out into a rough rectangle, and spread each piece with a tablespoon of nutella. Partially slice the rectangle into ½ inch strips, keeping them all connected at one end. Then roll them over diagonally, and curl the resulting cigar-shape into a snail-shape.
Once shaped, lay each bun on a prepared piece of parchment paper and arrange them on the baking sheet with at least 2 inches of space between them. Let the buns proof for another hour.

Next, fold the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients. Then fold in the vegetable oil until thoroughly combined.
Prepare a standard 9” loaf pan by lining it with parchment paper, then greasing the parchment paper with your choice of shortening or cooking spray. Pour the batter into the loaf pan, and tap it on your counter to get rid of any air bubbles.

Start by washing and rinsing the red beans prior to soaking. Soak the red beans overnight. When you're ready to start cooking the paste, pour the red beans and water into a medium-sized pot. Ensure that the water level is about ¼"" above the red beans. Bring to a boil, then turn down the heat to simmer. Cook the beans until completely softened. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.
Since we are making a paste, you don't want a lot of liquid in the beans. Most of the water should be cooked off and the beans should be very thick before you move forward. Be careful, because as more water cooks off, burning the beans is very easy to do. This whole process will take a few hours.
When the beans have a thick consistency, transfer to a food processor. Depending on the size of yours, you may need to process the bean mixture in batches. Process until the mixture is totally smooth. If you like your red bean paste chunky, skip this step or process to desired consistency. Transfer the paste back to the pot.
Heat the paste over medium-low heat. Add the sugar and stir to dissolve. Then add the butter. More butter means a richer paste. You can also use vegetable oil at this step, but butter adds a more pleasant flavor. Cook for an additional 15-20 minutes to cook off even more moisture from the paste.
Quick disclaimer here: It won't look like the packaged red bean paste you get at the store because those pastes have enormous amounts of sugar and oil added to make them sticky and dark. We're going for a more natural Chinese bakery red bean paste here. If you like the store-bought red bean paste, feel free to take a shortcut and use that!
Set aside and let cool for an hour or so before using. Do not refrigerate!
To make the milk bread dough:
To save time, make the milk bread dough while the red bean paste is cooking. In the bowl of a mixer, add the heavy cream, milk, egg, sugar, cake flour, bread flour, yeast, and salt. Use the dough hook attachment, and turn on the mixer to “stir.” Let it go for 15 minutes, occasionally stopping the mixer to push the dough together. If you're in a humid climate and the dough is too sticky, feel free to add a little more flour 1/4 cup at a time until it comes together. The dough should be moist, but not so sticky that it sticks excessively to the bowl or dough hook. If you don't have a mixer and would like to knead by hand, extend the kneading time by 5-10 minutes.
After 15 minutes of mixing, the dough is ready for proofing. Cover the bowl with a damp towel and place in a warm spot for 1 hour. The dough will grow to 1.5X its original size.
Assemble the red bean bread:
Grease one standard loaf pan on all sides with butter. Also, line a cookie sheet with parchment paper.
After the hour of proofing, put the dough back in the mixer and stir for another 5 minutes to get rid of air bubbles. Dump the dough on a lightly floured surface, and cut it in half. Set aside one half for a red bean swirl loaf, and cut the other half into 8 pieces for individual red bean buns.
We'll start with the buns. Here's where the fun part comes in. For each bun, use about 2 tablespoons of red bean paste. For a standard red bean bun, just roll one piece of dough into a ball, flatten with your hand or roll out to half inch thickness and place the red bean filling in the center. Pinch the dough closed around the red bean and place on your cookie sheet, seam-side down.
To make some slightly more interesting shapes, just follow along with the pictures! You can roll them like cinnamon buns, and then make strategic cuts with scissors to add a decorative flair. Check out this post to see how to make the pretty swirl shape shown here.
Okay, now for the red bean swirl loaf. Take the first half of dough and shape into a rectangle. Roll out to a little less than ¾-inch thickness with a floured rolling pin, maintaining a rectangle shape. Now, take a few big dollops of red bean paste and spread over the center of the rectangle, leaving a few inches on either side of the rectangle and one inch along the top and bottom. The paste should be spread to about 1/8-inch thickness.
Fold over each side of the rectangle so a seam runs down the center of the dough. Pinch all the open edges closed.
Next, roll out the dough to flatten the seams and make the rectangle of dough roughly as large as it was when you started. Then, fold the dough into thirds (like you would if you were folding a piece of paper to put into an envelope). Roll it out into a rectangle once more. Add more flour to the dough/board if necessary.
Repeat the step of folding the dough into thirds, but this time, roll it out just so that the layers press together and the piece of dough is the length of the loaf pan. Make two lengthwise cuts in the dough so you have three segments. Braid the pieces with the layered sides facing up. This will make for a really nice pattern when it bakes up. Pinch the ends of the braided dough together and gently place into your buttered loaf pan.
Let the buns and the loaf proof for another hour. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Brush the risen dough with egg wash. Bake the buns for 18-20 minutes and the loaf for 35-45 minutes. Remove from the oven and brush the bread with sugar water to give them a really great shine, sweetness, and color.
These don't keep for too long, so if you don't gobble them up right away, best to store them in the refrigerator and then heat them up in the microwave for 20 seconds. The red bean swirl loaf is excellent sliced, toasted, and served with a little butter.
If you have red bean paste left over, it keeps really well in a tupperware in the fridge. If you want to make another batch of these buns, when the time comes, just warm up the paste ever so slightly in a small pot—just enough to make it easily spreadable.",en-US,4.63,,The Woks of Life,405,16 serving(s),298 kcal,46 g,8 g,9 g,5 g,37 mg,271 mg,14 g,1 serving,3 g,

218,Flaky Apple Pie,Sarah,https://thewoksoflife.com/flaky-apple-pie-recipe/,Chinese,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/apple-pie-23.jpg,"['1 tablespoon sugar', '1 teaspoon salt', '2 tablespoons hot water', '2 1/2 tablespoons cold water', '8 ounces unsalted butter ((8 ounces/225g = 2 sticks))', '2 1/2 cups all purpose flour', '1 tablespoon unsalted butter', '7-8 medium apples ((about 2 ½ pounds/1130g; peeled, cored, and sliced into ½-inch thick slices) )', '1 teaspoon cinnamon', '1 tablespoon lemon juice', '1/2 cup sugar', '1 1/2 tablespoons cornstarch', '1 egg ((beaten with 1 tablespoon water))']","Prepare the crust:
Dissolve 1 tablespoon sugar and 1 teaspoon salt in 2 tablespoons of hot water, and then add an additional 2 ½ tablespoons of cold water. Transfer to the freezer for 20 minutes.
Carefully grate the frozen butter using a box grater or the grating attachment on your food processor. You can also very finely chop it, taking care to minimize contact with your warm hands.
Add 2 1/2 cups all purpose flour to a mixing bowl, along with the grated butter. Combine the butter and flour quickly with your hands for a few seconds.
Drizzle the cold water solution evenly over the flour and butter, and work it with your hands quickly to squeeze it together into 2 balls roughly the same size. It will be a little dry and a tad challenging to ball together, but do your best. Place the dough in airtight reusable silicone bags (or wrap in plastic), and press the balls down into discs.
Transfer the dough discs to the fridge to chill for at least 1 hour (you can also make the dough a day in advance or freeze it if you’d like to make it further in advance).
Make the filling:
While the pie crust is resting, make the filling. Melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a large saute pan over medium high heat. Add the apples, and cook for 3 minutes, stirring to prevent sticking.
Add the cinnamon, lemon juice, and ½ cup of sugar. Cook for 5 minutes, until the apples are somewhat softened. Turn off the heat.
Dissolve the cornstarch in 2 tablespoons of water, and off the heat, pour it into the apple mixture. Stir to thicken. Allow to cool completely—the filling shouldn’t be warm when you add it to the pie shell!
Assemble & bake:
Position a rack in the center of your oven and place a baking sheet on the rack. Preheat the oven to 400°F/200°C.
Remove the dough from the fridge and allow it to sit at room temperature for about 5 minutes to soften slightly, so it’s easier to work with. If one of your dough discs looks larger than the other, take the larger of the two, and roll it out into an 11-12 inch (30 cm) circle. Fold gently in half, and transfer to the pie shell. The dough will break easily, and that’s ok. Patch it and press it back together if needed.
Place the pie shell in the refrigerator while you roll out the top crust. Roll the top crust into a 10-inch circle. Take the pie shell back out of the fridge, and add the cooled filling in an evenly layer. Cover with the top crust, and flute the edges or crimp the edges with a fork.
Brush the crust with egg wash (1 egg beaten with 1 tablespoon of water), and cut vent holes in the top. Place the pie on the heated baking sheet, and bake for 20 minutes. Then rotate the baking sheet 180°, reduce the heat to 375°F/190°C, and bake for an additional 30-35 minutes.

Set aside. Line your muffin tin with cupcake liners and set aside. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
In the bowl of your electric mixer, beat the butter until light yellow--about 1 minute. Add the light brown sugar and granulated sugar and cream together. Scrape down the bowls as needed. With the mixer on low, add the eggs one at a time, beating after each addition. Add the vanilla and beat on low speed until everything is combined.
With the mixer on, gradually add the dry ingredients and stir until the batter is smooth. Add the pumpkin and stir until thoroughly combined.
Using an ice cream scoop, fill the cupcake liners to about ⅔ of the way full. Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean. Let cool in the pan for 10-15 minutes, and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely before frosting.
While your cupcakes are cooling, prepare your frosting. Using an electric mixer, cream the butter for 2 minutes. Add the vanilla extract, milk, and 4 cups of confectioner’s sugar. Stir until smooth. Add the maple syrup and stir to combine. Next, gradually add one cup of confectioner’s sugar at a time, stirring to combine before adding the next cup. Scrape down the sides of the bowl to ensure all of the butter is incorporated.
Now to divide your frosting into four parts--green, brown, orange, and white colors. Set aside about a ½ cup each for green and brown, about 1¼ cups for orange, and the rest for white.
To achieve the right colors, I used this as a rough guide, but here’s a quick rundown of what I did. For the green frosting, add drops of green food coloring until you have the desired shade. For the brown frosting, add drops of red and yellow in equal parts, adding a few drops of blue to make brown. For the orange, add mostly yellow food coloring, with a few drops of red to intensify the shade of orange.
Next for the cake tips! For the base, we used a standard star tip. Pipe the white frosting in a swirl pattern to create a base, or a “patch” for your pumpkins!
Next, using a regular circle tip, pipe on the pumpkins. Squeeze the frosting out, bouncing your wrist as you go to create a roughly spherical shape. Squeeze out the frosting vertically--don’t swirl for the pumpkins.
Next, using a plastic ziploc bag, cut a very small hole--about 2-3 millimeters in diameter--in one corner of the bag, and fill it with your brown frosting. Squeeze a small amount on each pumpkin to create a stem.
Lastly, for the green frosting, cut a very small small hole--about 1.5-2 millimeters in diameter--in one corner of the bag and fill it with half of your green frosting. Pipe small vines around the pumpkins, swirling and zigzagging as you see fit!
Next, take a cake tip that is vertically oriented with a notch in the center. There are many different kinds of cake tips that will result in different shaped leaves but we found this one to work best for this particular recipe. Make a few practice leaves on a plate before moving into the actual cupcakes. Twist the piping bag at the end of piping out the leaf to give it that organic flair.

If using frozen butter, take it out of the freezer to let it warm up just a bit while preparing other ingredients.
Prepare a cup of cold water and add a few ice cubes to it so it gets ice cold.
Place your mixing bowl into the refrigerator for a few minutes to cool it down.
It’s really important to keep the ingredients (especially the butter) cold so the butter and flour do not mix and meld together. The butter should be distributed throughout the dough Keeping the butter and flour separate creates the lamination, or layers, in the puff pastry.
Make the rough puff pastry dough:
Mix together the flour and salt in your chilled bowl.
Use a hand grater to grate your cold butter on top of the flour and salt. Work quickly so the butter stays cold.
Mix flour, salt, and grated butter together until the mixture turns coarse and crumbly.
Add 6 tablespoons ice water one tablespoon at a time and mix with a rubber spatula before adding the next one until the dough comes together. Add another tablespoon of ice water if you see there is an excess of flour in the bowl and the dough is dry.
Now you can use your hands to press the dough together into a ball and quickly form a rough disk. At this stage, the puff pastry dough will be a little shaggy and streaky which is ok. Make sure you do not overwork the dough.
Immediately wrap your rough puff pastry dough in plastic wrap and chill it in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes or in the freezer for 15 minutes.
First turn: roll and fold your rough puff pastry:
Flour a surface, preferably a stone countertop to keep the dough cool and flour your rolling pin thoroughly as well.
After the dough has chilled, transfer it to a floured surface (reserve the plastic wrap for use again) and use a rolling pin to roll it out into a 6x15 inch rectangle (15x38 cm). Use the rolling pin or your hands to push the edges of the dough inward if they begin to crack; keep your rectangle’s edges straight and not rounded. No need to be obsessive, but neatness does matter to creating uniform layers.
When rolling out the dough, it is important to work quickly to keep the dough cool.
Fold one side of the puff pastry dough over the top of the middle third of the dough and fold the remaining third of the dough on top of that.
Brush off any excess flour from the dough, re-wrap the pastry in the piece of plastic wrap you saved, and chill in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes or in the freezer for 15 minutes.
I suggest keeping the same rolling surface untouched and ready for the next “turn.”
Second turn: roll and fold your rough puff pastry twice:
Roll the dough out again into a 6x15 inch rectangle (15x38 cm).
Fold one side of the puff pastry dough over the top of the middle third of the dough and fold the remaining third of the dough on top of that.
Rotate the dough 90 degrees and repeat the same process, rolling out the dough again into another 6x15 inch rectangle and folding the pastry into thirds.
Brush off any loose flour, wrap the pastry again in plastic, and chill in the refrigerator for another 30 minutes or in the freezer for 15 minutes.
Third turn: roll and fold your rough puff pastry twice:
For your third and final turn, repeat the same steps you performed in the second turn. Wrap and return to the refrigerator.
The pastry can be used 90 minutes after the last time you rolled it. You can also leave the pastry in the freezer for up to a month as long as it is sealed tightly in plastic wrap.",en-US,5.0,,The Woks of Life,270,12 serving(s),149 kcal,10 g,1 g,12 g,7 g,30 mg,51 mg,1 g,1 serving,1 g,

Sifting helps to make a fluffy pancake, which is especially important when incorporating fresh fruit into the batter.
In a medium-sized bowl, sprinkle 1 tablespoon of sugar over the blueberries. I like this step, because it sweetens the blueberries slightly and helps bring out their true taste. If you have very sweet blueberries, you can omit this step.
Lightly beat 1 egg in a large mixing bowl, and add the milk. Make sure that you take these ingredients out in advance so they are at room temperature. Add in the sifted dry ingredients, and gently stir the batter, being careful not to over-mix. A few lumps in the batter at this stage is okay.
Next, carefully fold in the melted butter until completely incorporated. Be sure that it’s cooled slightly, or that your batter is at room temperature. This is important, or your butter will solidify when mixed with the cold ingredients. If you’re including the lemon zest, add it in now. Let the batter sit for 20 minutes.
After your batter has rested, fold in the blueberries. Now, we’re ready to get some pancakes over the fire! Heat up your cast iron pan or griddle. Cast iron is great for making pancakes, since they retain and maintain a constant heat--essential for making good pancakes!
Use a small dab of butter to coat the pan each time you drop in a new pancake. Heat control is everything when making pancakes, so be sure the butter sizzles when you put it down, but does not brown quickly; if it does, turn the heat down slightly.
Spoon 1/3 cup of batter (or ½ cup for larger pancakes) into the pan. The pancake is ready to flip once bubbles have formed across the pancake, and the bottom is golden brown and slightly crispy (about 2½ minutes). You can use a spatula to gently lift the edge of the pancake to take a peek.
Be careful flipping the pancake, because it will be a little unwieldy with the blueberries. You must be assertive, using a single motion--and flip only once! Let the pancake cook for another 1½ minutes, and transfer to a warm plate. Depending upon how large your pancake is and how you control the flame, the cooking times may vary by 30 seconds or so.

Grab some parchment paper and trace two outlines of the cake pan. Cut out the outlines (Perfect circles, voilá!) and place a sheet of parchment into each of your pans. Then butter and flour the pans again with the parchment paper in the bottom.
Sift the flour, sugar, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder, and salt into the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, and mix on low speed until combined. In a separate bowl or large measuring cup, combine the buttermilk, oil, eggs, and vanilla. With the mixer on low speed, slowly add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients.
Now grab your brewed coffee, and with the mixer still on low, slowly add the coffee. Mix just to combine, scraping the bottom of the bowl with a spatula to make sure everything's thoroughly mixed. The resulting batter will be quite thin.
Divide the batter evenly between the two pans and bake for 35 to 40 minutes, until a toothpick comes out clean. Let the cakes cool in the pans for 30 minutes, and then (carefully) turn them out onto a cooling rack to cool completely. If you didn’t use the parchment paper, definitely grab a butter knife to loosen the cakes first. The moist crumb makes these guys pretty delicate.
While the cakes are cooling, prepare your chocolate frosting.
Measure out your chocolate (if using bars, chop into pieces first) and place in a heat-proof bowl set over a small pot of simmering water. Stir until just melted and set aside until cooled to room temperature. Another cheat—it can be a little warm. Your frosting will be safe.
While that's happening, use your electric mixer + paddle attachment to beat 2 sticks of butter on medium-high speed until light yellow and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the egg yolk and vanilla and continue beating for 3 minutes.
With the mixer on low, gradually add the confectioners' sugar. The original recipe says to sift it—but really, just beat the frosting a little longer to get rid of any clumps! Continue to beat at medium speed, scraping down the bowl as necessary, until the frosting is smooth and creamy. Then add in the chocolate and beat until combined. Be careful not to over-whip the frosting.
At this point, you can dissolve the instant coffee powder in 2 teaspoons of hot water, and add it into the frosting. This step is optional.
Now, to frost the cake! Place the first cake layer on a flat plate or cake pedestal. Ina says flat side up. I say whichever the less mauled side is should be facing up. With a butter knife or offset spatula, spread with frosting—a little more than a ¼-inch thick.

Add a tiny bit more water if necessary, but not too much. Cover the dough and refrigerate for 20 minutes.
Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured board, knead gently, and form into a neat rectangle. Roll the dough away from you (not back and forth), forming a 20 x 50cm rectangle (about 8x20 inches). Try to keep the edges even, and don’t overwork the butter streaks. Flecks of butter should still be visible in the dough.
Fold the top third of the dough down to the center, then the bottom third up and over that. Give the dough a quarter turn (left or right) and roll out again to three times the length. Fold the same way as before, cover, and chill for 30 minutes.
While the dough is resting, make the filling. Dissolve 1/2 cup sugar into the cup of hot water, and allow to cool to room temperature. Whisk eggs and evaporated milk together and then thoroughly whisk in the sugar water and vanilla. Strain through a very fine mesh strainer--this step is extremely important to getting a smooth, glassy egg tart.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F/200 degrees C and position a rack in the lower third of your oven. Roll out the dough and cut circles to fit your tins (you can also use a shallow muffin pan).

If you're in a humid climate and the dough is too sticky, feel free to add a little more flour ¼ cup at a time until it comes together. If you don't have a mixer and would like to knead by hand, extend the kneading time by 5-10 minutes.
After 15 minutes of mixing, the dough is ready for proofing. Cover the bowl with a damp towel and place in a warm spot for 1 hour. The dough will grow to 1.5X its original size.
Meanwhile, prepare your filling and topping. To make the filling, heat 2 tablespoons oil in a wok over medium high heat. Add the onion and stir-fry for 2 minutes. Add the sugar, soy sauce, oyster sauce, sesame oil, and dark soy. Stir and cook until it starts to bubble up. Add the water and flour. Reduce the heat to medium low and cook, stirring, for a couple minutes until thickened. Remove from the heat and stir in the roast pork. Set aside to cool.
To prepare the topping, add the dry milk powder to a mixing bowl. If your dry milk powder has some larger clumps, crush them up with your fingers so it’s uniformly powdery. Add the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and superfine sugar. Stir to combine. Add the shortening, milk, egg yolk, and vanilla. Use your hands to mix everything together into a dough. If it’s too dry, add a little more milk a teaspoon at a time until it comes together. Cover with an overturned bowl or plate, and set aside at room temperature.
After the hour of proofing, put the dough back in the mixer and stir for another 5 minutes to get rid of air bubbles. You can also knead by hand. Dump the dough onto a lightly floured surface, and cut it into 18 equal pieces.
To assemble, divide the topping mixture into 18 equal pieces and roll each into a ball. Roll each ball out into a flat circle using a rolling pin.

Sift together the cake flour, cornstarch, and baking powder. Sift them twice. Sounds kind of fussy, but it’s a necessary step to making this cake light and airy.
In a large bowl, whisk together the 3 egg yolks and 2 ½ tablespoons sugar. Whisk in the oil and the milk until it’s light yellow and fully emulsified. Thoroughly fold in the sifted dry ingredients until there are no lumps. Set aside.
Using an electric mixer with the whisk attachment, whip the egg whites until you get soft peaks. Add another 2 ½ tablespoons of sugar to the egg whites and whip until you get stiff peaks.
Taking 1/3 of the egg white mixture at a time, fold it into the egg yolk mixture create a light and airy batter. Make sure everything is thoroughly combined. Line your baking pan with parchment paper. You can cut the four corners of the paper and overlap it to create smooth corners.
Pour the mixture in the pan and smooth it out so it’s completely even. It’s crucial that the batter be evenly distributed in the pan. Knock the bottom of the pan on a tabletop a few times (you can cover the table’s surface with a kitchen towel to make sure you don’t break anything) to get rid of any large air bubbles.
Place the pan onto a rimmed baking sheet and pour a cup of water into the baking sheet, so your pan is sitting in a shallow water bath. Place your whole apparatus on the middle rack of your oven and bake for 15 minutes.

Roll out the puff pastry into a 10x12 inch (25x30 cm) rectangle. From the 10-inch side, start rolling the pastry into a tight roll until you have a 10-inch long roll. Return the pastry to the freezer for 30 minutes to chill until firm.
Cut the chilled pastry roll into 12 equal disks that weigh about 35 g each (cut the pastry in half twice, and then cut each of the remaining 4 pieces into 3 equal pieces to get a total of 12). You can also use a ruler for this purpose. Start with 6 pieces first, wrap the rest up, and put them back in the refrigerator or freezer to keep them chilled.
On a very lightly floured surface, place each piece of dough so the swirls in the dough are facing up. Use a rolling pin to roll each piece into a flat disc about ¼ inch wider than the diameter of the tin and about 3/16 inches thick. Use flour sparingly when rolling out the discs. Using a pastry scraper or metal spatula to lift the discs will help keep them intact.
Place each disk onto the bottom of each custard tart tin and press the dough onto the tin. When you spread the dough into the tart tin, form a lip that sits on top of the perimeter of the tin. This is crucial for preventing the custard from overflowing. Work quickly so your dough doesn’t heat up. Have some all-purpose flour on the table in case the dough sticks to your fingers, and as you press the dough against the bottom and the sides of the tin, try not to overwork it.
Freeze the finished tart cups for at least 35 minutes or until frozen. You can make the pastry tins ahead of time and keep them frozen for up to 2 weeks.
Make the custard filling:
Whisk ½ cup heavy cream, ½ cup sugar, 1¼ cup whole milk, 2 egg yolks, 4 teaspoons cornstarch, and 1¼ teaspoon vanilla extract in a small saucepan until the sugar is dissolved.
Place over medium low heat, continuing to whisk until the mixture begins to coat the sides of the pan. Patience and low heat are key to a successful custard. The custard should get just hot enough so you see steam beginning to form. This is your signal that the custard is almost ready.
When the custard is thick enough to coat a spoon, remove from the heat and continue to whisk, ensuring you scrape the sides of the pan. Whisk until it is no longer hot. Do not cook the custard into a pudding, or it will dry out too much during baking! It’s a fairly thin consistency.
Set aside to cool completely, pressing plastic wrap onto the surface of the custard so a skin does not form on top.
Assembly and baking:
Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C). Place the frozen pastry shells on a sheet pan (you can line it with parchment paper for easy cleanup).
Spoon the cooled custard in each shell until the custard is about 3/16 inches below the top of the pastry shell. Work quickly since you don’t want to give the custard any chance of soaking into the pastry. It’s important to have the oven ready to go once you start pouring custard into the shells.
Put the pan on the middle rack of your oven, and immediately turn the oven temperature down to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). The total baking time for your Portuguese Custard Tarts should be 30 minutes, but check them after 20 minutes and rotate the pan if they are browning unevenly.
After 25 minutes, if the pastry is turning golden brown and you see those signature scorched bubbles forming, you’re on track for another 5 minutes. If the pastry looks like it is browning too fast, you may want to turn the heat off to let residual heat finish the baking process. Oven temperatures are not always accurate and may be slightly hotter or cooler than the temperature you set it for, so play it by ear.
When baking is complete, remove the custard tarts from the oven (leaving them in the tins), and place on a rack to cool.
Your Portuguese Custard Tarts will smell incredible, but be sure to wait until they cool, as the custard will be extremely hot. Once they are cool enough to handle, remove the custard tarts from the tins and enjoy them warm!

In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, 2 tablespoons sugar, and a teaspoon of salt. Add in the chilled shortening and cut it in with a pastry cutter or two butter knives. Once that’s looking crumbly, cut in the chilled butter until it resembles coarse crumbs. Work quickly to keep the ingredients cold.
Sprinkle 5-6 tablespoons of ice water into the mixture and stir it in until it forms a dough (if you’re in a dry climate, you may need a couple extra tablespoons). Divide the dough into two pieces and place each one on a piece of plastic wrap. Flatten them into disks, wrap them up, and put them in the fridge for at least an hour.
To peel the peaches, bring a pot of water to a boil and prepare an ice bath. Cut an x in the bottom of each peach. Blanch the peaches in boiling water for 40-60 seconds (less time for really ripe peaches, more time for peaches that might be a little less ripe). Remove from the pot with a slotted spoon and dunk into the ice bath. Let them cool in the ice water for at least a minute, and the peel will come right off!

Sift 1 cup cake flour, ⅛ teaspoon salt, and 3½ teaspoons baking powder. Fold into the batter gently until incorporated. Try to break up any large lumps, but don’t overwork the batter––some smaller lumps are okay!
Let the batter sit for 30 minutes. The dry ingredients absorb, and the baking powder has a chance to do its thing. While the batter is resting, line a 9 inch bamboo steamer basket with parchment paper. You can also use a 9 inch cake pan greased with vegetable shortening or butter and lightly coated with all-purpose flour. Lightly buttering and flouring the metal cake pan is important step, even if it is non-stick!
Gently stir the batter again in a folding motion—just enough to ensure the batter is mixed uniformly, but not too much since air pockets have already started to form in the batter. You will also see that the batter has thickened and most lumps have disappeared.
Pour the batter into the bamboo steamer basket lined with parchment paper or your prepared cake pan. Let the batter sit and settle for another 10 minutes while you heat up your steamer.

Remove and discard the bitter green center. (Or buy lotus seed halves and skip this step.) Rinse under running water, place in a bowl, and cover with fresh water. Soak overnight.
The next day, drain the lotus seeds and rinse them again. In a pot, add the soaked seeds along with 4 cups (950 ml) of water. The water level should be above the lotus seeds, so make sure you're not using a pot that is too shallow or wide.
Turn on the heat, and bring the mixture to a boil. Once boiling, turn the heat down to low. Simmer the seeds for 30 minutes. The seeds are done once they’re soft, but still maintain their shape. Cool completely, and drain.
In a food processor, puree the cooked lotus seeds until smooth (it’s best to do this in two batches). Transfer the purée to a non-stick pan, cast-iron pan, or thick-bottomed Dutch oven (to avoid sticking/burning).

You can use our recipe for sweet red bean paste, or opt for store-bought. Our original recipe makes a large batch, but you can freeze leftovers to make other recipes. To make the exact amount needed for this recipe, scale the serving size down from 21 to 4 in the recipe card. The filling must be cooled completely and can be made up to several days in advance.
In a large mixing bowl, add 1 teaspoon sugar to ¼ cup warm water, and stir in the yeast until dissolved. Let sit for 15 minutes until the yeast foams up.
Next, stir in the milk and add the flour, powdered sugar, and salt. With the dough hook attachment, turn the mixer on low. Let the mixer go for 5 minutes, or knead by hand for 8 minutes, or until the dough is soft and smooth. The dough should not stick to your hands or the bowl.
Cover with a plate to proof for 1 hour in a warm spot, or until the dough doubles in size. I proof the dough inside my closed microwave with a large mug of just boiled water next to it.
While the dough is proofing, roll 8 balls of red bean filling between your palms. Each should weigh about 25g. Cover them with a damp towel to prevent them from drying out. Set aside.
Cut out eight 3""x 3"" squares of parchment paper for the buns to sit on in the steamer.
Once the dough is done proofing, put it back in the mixer and knead for another 2 to 3 minutes to get rid of any air bubbles (or knead by hand). Transfer to a clean, lightly floured surface. Use a kitchen scale to equally divide the dough into 8 pieces (mine were 50g apiece). Cover with a clean kitchen towel while you assemble the buns.
To assemble, roll a dough ball into a 4-inch disc, making the edges slightly thinner than the center. Put one ball of red bean filling in the center of the dough. Gather the edges of the dough around the filling, and pinch the edges together to close the opening.
Place the dough seam side down on a parchment square, and transfer to your steaming rack. The buns need at least 1-inch of space between each other. Repeat with the remaining dough until all the buns are assembled.
Prepare your steamer with about 5 cups of warm water. Put the buns in the steamer and cover. Your steamer water should be lukewarm to help with proofing, but do not turn on the heat at this time. Let them proof for 30 minutes.
Now turn the heat on to medium/high. Set your timer for 15 minutes, during which the heat will slowly bring the water to a boil and steam the buns. It may seem slow to heat in the beginning, but don’t be tempted to disturb the buns or remove the lid.
After the 15-minutes have elapsed, turn off the heat, and let the buns sit in the steamer with the lid tightly covered for another 5 minutes. DO NOT UNCOVER THE LID AT ANY POINT DURING THE STEAMING AND POST-STEAMING TIME. The buns need 5 minutes to set, or they will collapse and become wrinkly, so be patient.

Heat some water in a medium to large, deep pot. The water should be about 2 inches deep, and the pan should be large enough to accommodate the mixing bowl. Once the water boils, turn the heat to down to a simmer.
In a large heatproof bowl or the metal mixing bowl that came with your stand mixer, add the eggs and powdered sugar. Beat for a minute on low. Next, add the milk and heavy cream, and beat for a few seconds to combine. Then sift in the flour, starch, and dried milk powder. Mix everything in until there are no lumps. Now add in the melted butter, and stir to combine.
Next, carefully lower the mixing bowl into the pan of water, and begin stirring the mixture quickly and continuously. I used a stainless steel mixing bowl, so the egg mixture solidified rather quickly--it took about a minute. It’s essential that you stir quickly in this process. It may take longer if you use a thicker bowl. Once the egg mixture solidifies into a thick custard, remove from the heat. Do not overcook! Let it cool completely, and it’s ready to use.
Cover the custard to prevent it from drying out while you make the dough. Note: If you’d like to make the filling a day or two early, store it in an air-tight container and refrigerate it.
Now make the dough. In a large mixing bowl, dissolve the yeast in ¼ cup of warm water. Let sit for 10-15 minutes until you see yeast bubbles floating on top of the water.
Now add in the flour, powdered sugar, salt, and coconut milk. Turn on the mixture with the dough hook attachment and set it to low, then slowly add in the regular milk, one tablespoon at a time until a dough is formed. A perfect dough should not stick to your hands or to the bowl--the texture should be smooth like a baby’s bottom!
Cover the dough with a dry kitchen towel, and let it proof for 1 hour. I usually proof my dough in my microwave with the door closed and a mug of just-boiled water next to it. While the dough is proofing, let’s prepare a few things:
Equally divide the egg custard filling into 12 pieces and roll them in your palms to form round balls. Cover them to prevent them from drying out. Prepare the steamer. With this recipe, we will start steaming with cold water, so there is no need to pre-boil the water. Cut out twelve 4""x4"" pieces of parchment paper.
The proofed dough should be about 2½-3 times its original size. Once the dough has finished proofing, put it back in the mixer and let it go for another 2-3 minutes to get rid of any air bubbles.
Now, transfer the dough to a clean and lightly floured surface. With the help of your kitchen scale, equally divide the dough into 12 pieces, and cover with a dry kitchen towel while you assemble the buns. Take one dough ball, roll it out into a 4-inch disc, taking care to make sure the edges are slightly thinner than the center. Put a ball of custard filling on top, pleat, and close the top of the bun--see the video! Place it on a piece of pre-cut parchment paper, and set it on your steaming rack. Repeat until all of the buns are assembled.
Put the buns in the steamer filled with warm water, covered with the lid (do not turn on the heat at this time). Let them sit and proof for another 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, turn the heat on and set it to medium. Set your timer for 12 minutes. During these 12 minutes, the medium heat will slowly bring the water to a boil and steam the buns. It may seem slow and lack action at the beginning, but trust me, the buns will be steamed nicely after just 12 minutes.
VERY IMPORTANT NOTE!!! After the 12-minute timer (for steaming) goes off, set the timer for another 5 minutes and turn off the heat. DO NOT UNCOVER THE LID. The buns need about 5 minutes to cool and set or they will collapse, so be patient. They can only be revealed after the 5-minute timer goes off.
Eat them while they are hot, just like you would if they were straight off the dim sum cart. You can also freeze the leftover buns in a zip-lock bag, and just re-steam when you want to have a bun for a rainy day!",en-US,4.66,,The Woks of Life,195,12 serving(s),167 kcal,25 g,5 g,5 g,3 g,39 mg,97 mg,9 g,1 serving,1 g,

Preheat your oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch springform pan and wrap the bottom in foil (you’re going to be putting the cheesecake in a water bath, and you don’t want the water to seep into the pan from the bottom).

If you don’t have a food processor, whisk the dry ingredients together in a bowl, and cut in the butter using 2 butter knives or a pastry blender. Transfer to a large mixing bowl.
Next, process the peanuts until you have a mix of fine and coarse crumbs. Mix with 1 tablespoon of sugar and set aside.
Mix the beaten egg yolk with the sour cream and stir into the dry mixture to make the dough. At this point, if the dough is still dry and not coming together, drizzle in 3 tablespoons of milk 1 tablespoon at a time until the dough is formed (you may not need all 3 tablespoons).

Use an electric mixture or a clean, dry whisk to beat the egg whites until soft peaks form. Gradually beat in the remaining ¼ cup sugar until stiff peaks form. Fold this egg white mixture into your batter just until combined.
Pour into your prepared pan and bake for 25 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean. Poke the cake all over with a toothpick. Pour the syrup evenly over the cake, so it seeps into those little holes in the warm cake. (Tip, take your candied rose buds and drop them into a cup of tea. It’s awesome).

In the bowl of a mixer, add the heavy cream, milk, egg, sugar, cake flour, bread flour, yeast, and salt (in that order). Using the dough hook attachment, turn on the mixer at its lowest setting.
Let it go for 15 minutes, occasionally stopping the mixer to push the dough together. (Note: if you’re in a humid climate, and the dough is too sticky, add more flour ¼ cup at a time until the dough comes together). After 15 minutes, the dough is ready for proofing. Cover the bowl with a damp towel and place in a warm spot for 1 hour. The dough will grow to about 1.5X its original size.
Meanwhile, prepare the filling by thoroughly combining all the filling ingredients in a bowl. Set aside.
After the bread dough has proofed for an hour, put the dough back in the mixer and knead slowly for another 5 minutes to get rid of air bubbles. Dump the dough on a lightly floured surface and cut into 12 equal pieces.
Flatten each piece of dough with your hands into a rough oval shape, about 4 inches long and 3 inches wide. Spread about a tablespoon of filling onto the middle of the dough, and roll it into a cigar, tucking the ends under the bun to completely seal the filling in. We like this method because it evenly distributes the filling throughout the bun.
Transfer the buns to a parchment-lined baking sheet and cover with a clean kitchen towel. Allow to rise for another 45 minutes to an hour.
Preheat your oven to 350 degrees. For the topping, mix together 1/3 cup cake flour, 3 tablespoons softened butter, and 4 ½ teaspoons caster sugar, and transfer to a piping bag or small zip top bag with a small corner cut off. Set aside.
Once the buns have risen, brush with egg wash. Pipe two stripes of your topping mixture onto each bun, and sprinkle each with sesame seeds. Bake for 15-17 minutes until golden.

I take fresh, ripe peaches, peel them, and gently crush them with a fork to release juices and flavor with minimal equipment and cleanup! Ripe, in-season peaches are really easy to peel, even without the trick of blanching them first to loosen the peels. If you’re wondering if your peach is ripe enough, make an “X” in the bottom of the peach with a paring knife. Grab the little corners of skin, and they should peel away easily. If not, make an “X” in the bottom of the peach and then blanch it in boiling water for 30-60 seconds. The peel will come right off. But keep in mind, it’s delicious, tree-ripened fruit that makes these peach pancakes great!
In a large bowl, sift together the flour, sugar, salt, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and nutmeg. In a measuring cup, measure out the milk, and then crack in an egg and beat until well-combined. Beat in the vanilla. Add this wet mixture to the batter, and fold gently just until combined. Fold in the crushed peaches, followed by the melted butter. Don’t overmix––a few lumps are okay!
Let the batter stand at room temperature for 30 minutes. The batter should thicken slightly as the dry ingredients completely absorb the liquids. Fold in more flour if the batter is too thin from super juicy peaches since thin batter will result in less fluffy pancakes. This is where you need to have a bit of judgement according to your peaches.
Heat your cast iron skillet over medium heat. Make sure you preheat the cast iron pan thoroughly before dropping in any butter/pancake batter. You can adjust the heat as needed until the butter sizzles when you add it to the pan and spread it around, but doesn’t immediately brown (that’s a sign it’s too hot!). Good butter placement is key to the signature look of a good pancake.
Brush the pan with a small pat of butter or spread it around with a butter knife, and pour ½ cup of batter for each pancake onto your pan or griddle.Cook until bubbles form on the top of the pancake, and the bottom of the pancake is golden brown.
Flip the pancake once, and cook until the pancake springs back when pressed in the center (about 90 seconds). Transfer to a serving plate and repeat with the rest of the batter.
While your pancakes are cooking, stir together the heavy cream and the maple syrup to make the maple cream syrup. Bonus step is to warm up the syrup in a small pot before adding the cream!

Stir constantly (so they don’t burn) until the peanuts are fragrant, about 10 minutes. Allow the nuts to cool completely. If using pre-roasted nuts, you may skip this step.
Once the peanuts are completely cool, use your hands to loosen the skins from the peanuts. Now, the next part is a little tricky. Grasp the pan with both hands, and toss the peanuts up and down, while angling the pan slightly downward. If all goes right, the peanuts should flip up in the air and land back into the pan while the skins fly out over the sides. It’s a good idea to do this over the sink. Of course, you can also buy shelled, already skinned peanuts. You can also buy plain roasted peanuts of course, but roasting them at home will make the peanut brittle taste a lot fresher.
Next, crush the peanuts into smaller pieces by laying them on a large cutting board or clean kitchen surface and rolling with a rolling pin. Set the peanuts aside. Now brush the surface of your cutting board and rolling pin with a very light layer of oil to prevent sticking when you pour the brittle on it later.
Using the same pan from earlier, melt the rock sugar by stirring constantly over medium low heat. It will take about 5 minutes to melt the rock sugar completely. Add the peanuts and sesame seeds to the melted sugar and mix well.

Roll out the pastry rectangle slightly and split it into two rectangles. Re-wrap and return one of them to the fridge to stay chilled. You will be able to make two batches of palmiers, with different flavors if you like.
Mix together the sugar and salt. Divide the mixture in half (about a ¼ cup each). Spread out 2 tablespoons of the sugar mixture onto a clean work surface and roll out the single puff pastry rectangle into a 12 inch square on top of the sugar.
Spread another 2 tablespoons evenly on top, and lightly roll it into the dough, ensuring both sides are evenly coated. Be sure to gather any loose sugar on the work surface and use it on top of the dough. This should use ¼ cup total sugar.
If using any added ingredients (e.g., dark chocolate, pecans, rosemary/garlic, etc.), sprinkle half over the folded dough. (Note, for the savory mixtures, you are replacing the sugar.)
Fold both sides of the square toward the center so they go halfway to the middle. Fold the folded sides again so the two folds meet exactly at the middle of the dough.

You can either follow our instant pot red bean paste recipe, or our stovetop version.
Then make the soft dough. In a large mixing bowl, mix together 3 cups of flour and 2 tablespoons sugar. Form a well in the flour, and add ¾ cup of lard. Slowly add 1 cup of lukewarm water in 3-4 batches, mixing with a rubber spatula. Keep folding the lard into the flour with a spatula to form a smooth dough ball. Cover with clear plastic wrap and let it rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.
To make the pastry dough, combine 2 cups of cake flour with ⅔ cup lard. Knead and form the dough ball. Cover with clear plastic wrap, and chill in the fridge for 30 minutes.
To assemble the mooncakes: after both kinds of dough have chilled for 30 minutes, take them out and weigh each ball. Take the total weight of both balls of dough (we’ll be combining them), and divide it by the number of balls of red bean paste filling that you have (you will have made these balls of filling when following the recipe for the filling). This will give you the amount of dough needed for each mooncake. I needed 55 grams of dough to make 1 mooncake.
Now transfer the soft dough onto a clean and lightly-floured flat surface. Divide the soft dough as well as the pastry dough into two equal portions, and do the next step in two batches, especially if you don’t have a large surface.
On a floured surface, press the soft dough into a large disc, and add the pastry dough in the middle. Close all sides to form a large ball. Remember to keep flouring the work surface as needed to prevent it from sticking. With a rolling pin, roll it into a rectangle shape about ¼-inch thick. Then fold the rectangle shape into a tri-fold. Roll it out again into a rectangle shape that’s about ⅛-inch thick. Roll up the sheet on the long-side into a tube and do your best to roll it tight. Now cut the tube into cylinders, each weighing as much as you calculated with the help of a kitchen scale.
Now take one dough segment and stand it upright so that the swirls are facing up, and press it flat. With a rolling pin, roll the dough into a 4-inch disc (it should be slightly thinner around the outer edges and thicker in the middle). Add a ball of sweet red bean paste filling in the center, then close all the sides until it’s sealed tight and no filling is visible. Put the seam side down, gently flattening the ball into a round disc that’s 1-inch thick. Place it on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, seam side down, with at least an inch of space on all sides. Repeat until you’ve made all the mooncakes. At this point, you can also stamp the mooncakes with a design using 10 drops of red food coloring mixed with ⅛ teaspoon water. Simply dip your stamp (or a star anise pod) into the ""ink,"" shake off any excess, and stamp the center of the mooncakes).
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F, with a rack positioned in the middle of the oven. Bake the mooncakes for 15 minutes.

To Make Shabu Shabu
Bring a medium pot of water to a boil. Once boiling, add 2 Tbsp sake and ½ tsp salt and reduce the heat to low heat/simmer.
One slice at a time, cook the pork loin in the simmering water until no longer pink. Do not overcook. As soon as the color changes, take it out.
Transfer to a plate lined with a paper towel. Continue with the rest of the meat. Try not to put all the meat at once. It will overcook and the meat slices clump together. Let cool at the counter until the meat is at room temperature, then transfer to the refrigerator to chill.
To Make Dressing
Please Note: If you increase the amount of salad or like to pour more dressing, you may want to double the recipe. The dressing ingredients are measured for the exact amount for this recipe. Peel the skin of ginger and grate until you have ½ tsp of grated ginger.
In a small bowl, combine 2 Tbsp soy sauce, 2 Tbsp sesame oil, 2 Tbsp rice vinegar, and ½ tsp sugar.
And add ½ tsp grated ginger, ¼ tsp freshly ground black pepper, and 1 tsp white sesame seeds.
Whisk together until sugar is completely dissolved. You can pour the dressing into a serving container (optional). You can keep this dressing for up to a week, if you want to make a lot ahead.
To Make Salad
Cut the mizuna into 2-inch pieces and put them into a large bowl.
Remove the core of the iceberg lettuce and then cut into julienned pieces.
Cut off the ends of the cucumber and cut it in half lengthwise. Then thinly slice the halves diagonally.
Thinly slice the onion against the grain. Then transfer to iced water and soak for 5 minutes to remove the bitterness and make the onion crisp.
Combine the mizuna, iceberg lettuce, cucumber, and onion in a large bowl and toss together. If you have time, chill for 30 minutes.
To Serve
Cut the tomato into wedges.
Serve the salad on a plate, topped with pork and tomatoes. Drizzle the dressing and enjoy! Optional: You can add pork and dressing in the bowl and toss all together before plating. This is my preferred serving style; however, the classic Shabu Shabu Salad is typically constructed with layers of salad and pork, topped with the dressing.
To Store
You can prepare and store this dish ahead of time. Keep the salad, pork, and dressing separately until you're ready to serve. You can keep it for 24 hours. The dressing can be made ahead and kept in an airtight jar for up to a week.",en-US,4.41,,Just One Cookbook,55,4 serving(s),,,,,,,,,,,

Place a stainless steel steamer basket inside your pressure cooker (I use a 6QT Instant Pot) and add 1 cup of water.
In a small saucepan, place an egg and cover it with water. Bring it to boil with medium-high heat. Once boiling, reduce the heat to simmer and cook for 12 minutes.
When the egg is done, immediately discard the boiling water and cool the egg with cold water. Once the egg has cooled, remove the eggshell and mash the boiled egg in a small bowl with a fork.
While the egg is cooking, peel the potato skins and cut into 1 ½ inch (4 cm) pieces. They should be roughly about the same size so that they’ll be cooked at an equal rate. Remove starch by soaking the potatoes or if you don’t have any wait time, add them directly to the pressure cooker. By soaking the cut potatoes in water, it removes the starch and helps retain its colors.
Place the potatoes in the steamer basket inside the pressure cooker. Close lid and pressure cook at high pressure for 5 minutes. Make sure to turn the sealing vent to the “sealed” position. For Instant Pot, click “Steam” and set the cooking time to 5 minutes.
While the potatoes are cooking, prepare other ingredients. Cut the sliced hams into ¼ inch cubes.
Peel the carrot skin and slice using a mandolin slicer. Mandolin slicer will help you achieve very thin slices of carrot. If you don’t have one, simply slice the carrot into thin slices.
Peel the cucumber skin leaving some parts unpeeled. Use a mandolin to slice the cucumber or slice thinly with a knife.
Sprinkle ½ tsp kosher salt over carrot and cucumber and massages with hands. Wait for 10 minutes to let them dehydrate. Alternatively, you can blanch the sliced carrot (don't blanch cucumber) for 2-3 minutes until tender.
Quickly rinse under water, gently squeeze out water and set aside.
Once cooking completes, you can let the pressure valve release naturally (takes about 15-20 minutes) or manually release the pressure. Insert a wooden skewer in the center of a potato. If it goes through smoothly then the potatoes are ready. If the skewer gets stuck in the potato, cook for a bit longer. When the potatoes are done, take out the steam basket and transfer the potatoes to a bowl (I used suribachi – Japanese mortar here). Mash potatoes with a masher or a large fork (I used surikogi – Japanese pestle here – my mom’s method). Don’t crush the potatoes completely, leave some small chunks for texture.
Season the mashed potato with ½ tsp kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper.
Add 2 tsp rice vinegar and mix all together. Set aside to let cool.
Add eggs, cucumbers, carrots, and ham to the mashed potato and mix all together.
Add 4 Tbsp mayonnaise and combine well. Taste the potato salad first before adding more mayonnaise or salt.

To Prepare Shrimp
Devein shrimp if not done so already. Keep the shell on while cooking so the flavors will be kept inside the shell. Sprinkle some potato or corn starch and coat the shrimp. It will absorb the smell and dirty particles from the shrimp. Rinse the shrimp under running water.
Add ⅓ cup sake in the frying pan and bring it to a boil.
Add the shrimp in a single layer and cover the lid.
Cook for 2-3 minutes depending on the size. Turn over half way.
Once the shrimp is no longer opaque, take it out on a plate and let cool. Save the remaining juice from cooking shrimp in a bowl.
To Make the Marinade
Combine ½ cup olive oil, ¼ cup rice vinegar, 2 Tbsp mirin, 1 tsp salt, freshly ground black pepper, and ½ Tbsp juice from cooking shrimp. Whisk well and taste. Adjust with salt if necessary. Set aside.
To Prepare the Rest of Ingredients
Thinly slice the boiled octopus as much as you can so it’s less chewy. Cut the celery into smaller pieces.
Cut the bell peppers into smaller pieces. I like to use Japanese “rangiri” cutting style where you cut the vegetables diagonally as you rotate them 90 degrees. This creates a more unique and random cut, creating more surface space.
Thinly slice the red onion and carrot. And cut the thin slabs of carrot into halves.
Thinly slice the red radishes and cut the cherry tomatoes in halves.
Mince the parsley and thinly slice the lemon.
Shrimp must be cool by now. Peel the shell and remove the tails.

Let the steak sit at room temperature for 30 minutes.
Pat dry the steak with a paper towel. Sprinkle both sides (and the edges) generously with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper.
Heat the olive oil in a cast-iron pan on high heat. I usually use a silicone brush to apply the oil. Sear the steak in the pan, about 3-4 minutes each side. During this time, do not move the steak around or flip. You can use tongs to press down so the steak gets nice sear marks.
Remove the steak from the heat and let it rest on a cutting board for 10 minutes. If you cut the meat right away, all the juice will come out. Cut thin slices, against the grain of the meat.

Meanwhile, slice the bread and cut it into about ¾ inch (2 cm) cubes.
Add the bread cubes into the bowl and toss until the bread is lightly and evenly coated with the olive oil. Spread bread cubes in a single layer on a baking sheet.
Bake at 400ºF (200ºC) for 15-20 minutes, or until golden brown. Turn once halfway through cooking in order to brown all sides of the croutons.

In a large pot, add 4 cups water, ½ tsp salt, and 2 Tbsp sake and bring it to boil.
Cut the green onions to thirds and cut the ginger into thin slices (you can keep the peel on). Add them to the pot.
Butterfly the chicken breast, by cutting the length of the side of the chicken breast with the edge of your knife parallel to the cutting board. Carefully slice the breast in half widthwise until the other edge. Now you have two pieces of chicken breast.
Once water is boiling, put the chicken in the pot. Cover the lid and reduce the heat to the lowest setting. Cook the chicken for 15 minutes, or until cooked through.

Transfer the toasted sesame seeds into your Japanese mortar and pestle. You don’t have to completely grind the sesame seeds. To add texture to the dressing, it’s nice to keep both powdered sesame seeds and whole sesame seeds. If you don’t have a Japanese mortar and pestle, you can use a food processor.
Transfer the ground sesame seeds into a 2-cup measuring cup. Add honey, rice vinegar, soy sauce, and sesame oil. Whisk all together and set aside.
Prepare the toppings
Crack the egg in a medium bowl and whisk well. Add ¼ tsp kosher salt and combine well.
Heat the oil in the non-stick frying pan over medium-high heat. Once the frying pan is hot, add the egg mixture. Turn down the heat to low and swirl the pan to evenly distribute the egg in the pan. Once the egg mixture is set, you can flip to cook the other side (optional) or continue to cook longer until the egg is cooked through. Turn off the heat and transfer the egg crepe to the working surface.
Cut the egg crepe in half and thinly slice it. Set aside.

Remove tofu from the paper towel. Break it into pieces with your hands and add to the sesame seed mixture.
Using a pestle, mash and grind the tofu until smooth or to your liking.
It’s important to taste the tofu and season with salt to taste. It should not be bland. Green beans will be added, so the tofu dressing should have good flavor at this stage.
Mix all together until smooth.
To Assemble
Be sure to shake off any excess soy sauce from the green beans first. Any liquid from the soy sauce will only dilute the dressing. Then add the seasoned green beans to the tofu dressing. Combine well.
Once combined, you can chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes before serving, or serve immediately.

To Make Japanese Mayonnaise
You can make my Homemade Japanese Mayonnaise or modify American mayonnaise with Mizkan Natural Rice Vinegar and sugar. For 4 Tbsp of American mayonnaise (I use Best Foods/Hellmann’s Mayonnaise), add ½ Tbsp rice vinegar and ¾ tsp sugar. Whisk until sugar dissolves.
To Boil Macaroni
Start boiling 3 quarts (12 cups, 2.8 L) water in a large pot (I used a 3.5 QT pot). Once boiling, add 1 Tbsp salt and macaroni. Cook according to the package instructions plus 1 minute more.
Drain the macaroni and transfer to a large bowl. While hot, add 2 tsp olive oil.
Add 1 Tbsp rice vinegar and 1 tsp sugar and mix well together. Set aside to let cool completely.
To Make Boiled Egg
In a medium saucepan, add water that covers 1 large egg and bring it to a boil over medium heat. Optional Tip: If you want your egg yolk to be in the center, gently rotate the eggs with chopsticks once in a while for the first 3 minutes so the egg yolk will be in the center.
Once boiling, turn the heat down to medium-low and set a timer for 12 minutes (9 minutes for soft boiled egg). Once it’s done cooking, bring the pot under running water to cool or immediately transfer to an iced bath.
Peel the egg and cut it into small pieces.
To Prepare Vegetables
Cut off the ends and peel the onion. Cut into thin slices along the grain.
Peel the cucumber skin, leaving some part unpeeled (so it looks nice) and cut off the ends.
Thinly slice the cucumber (or use a mandolin). Put the sliced cucumber and onion in a medium bowl.
Sprinkle 1 tsp salt and lightly massage with hand to evenly distribute the salt. Set aside for 5 minutes.
When you see the liquid in the bowl, give the sliced vegetables a quick rinse to remove the salt.
Squeeze water out and set aside.
Cut the ham into small pieces, roughly ⅛ inch thick, 2 inch long pieces and set aside.
To Assemble Macaroni Salad
When the macaroni is cool, add the ham and sliced cucumber and onion.
Mix well together and add the chopped boiled egg.
Add 4 Tbsp Japanese mayonnaise and ¼ tsp freshly ground black pepper. Mix all together.
Taste the salad and see if you want to add more salt, pepper, or mayonnaise. Once the taste is good, chill the salad for 1 hour in the refrigerator before serving.

Preheat the oven to 450ºF (232ºC). For a convection oven, reduce cooking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC).
To Prepare Roasted Cauliflower
Cut the cauliflower into quarters.
Discard the core and cut into smaller, bite-size florets.
Rinse the cauliflower and drain well. Put it on a rimmed baking sheet. Drizzle olive oil all over the florets.
Season with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper and toss to combine with hands. Make sure each floret is coated with thin layer of oil (your hands get messy, but it makes great roasted cauliflower).
Roast in the oven for 17-20 minutes, or until edges are nicely caramelized and golden brown. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool.
To Prepare Miso Tahini Dressing
Mix tahini sauce really well before using. Combine 2 Tbsp Tahini Sauce, 4 Tbsp All-Purpose Miso Sauce, and 3 Tbsp rice vinegar in a small bowl or mason jar. All-Purpose Miso Sauce is sweetened. If you use regular miso instead, taste the dressing, and adjust the sweetness by adding sugar/honey to your liking. Each brand/type of miso has different saltiness and flavor. Make sure to taste your dressing (it should taste a bit stronger before combining with salad).
Whisk to combine or shake well. You can keep this dressing for up to a week in the refrigerator.
To Prepare Kale Salad
Thinly slice the red onion.
Grip the bottom of the stem with one hand and use the other hand to rip the leaves away from you, like this (Or, of course, you can use a knife to remove the leaf from stem). Tip: Sturdy kale stems can be chopped up and added to stir-fries.
Rinse in a colander, drain well, and chop the kale into smaller pieces (Rinse before chopping so all the good vitamins won't drain from kale).
Add the chopped kale and dressing in a bowl and toss to mix. Make sure that kale is well coated with dressing at this stage. Once you add cauliflower, you don't want to break them into smaller pieces.
Add the thinly sliced red onion and roasted cauliflower.
Gently toss one more time and serve at room temperature or chilled. Sprinkle glazed pecans and croutons.",en-US,4.62,,Just One Cookbook,30,4 serving(s),,,,,,,,,,,

Cover and soak 1 Tbsp wakame in water until it softens and hydrates, about 5 minutes.

Add 2 tsp sugar, 1 Tbsp soy sauce, and 3 Tbsp rice vinegar and mix well. Set aside.
I usually like to make a striped pattern by alternately peeling a ½-inch-wide strip lengthwise, then leaving a strip of the skin intact. With this method, the cucumber slices have some decorative dark green accents and a little bit of extra crunchiness.
Center align the cucumber on the spiralizer and press firmly to secure both ends (For The Inspiralizer, set to ""Blade A"" for wide ribbons). If you don’t use a spiralizer, simply slice the cucumber into thin slices.
Spin the handle clockwise to spiralize. Using a kitchen shears or knife, cut the spiralized cucumber into shorter lengths.
Sprinkle kosher salt and give some gentle massage. Set aside for a few minutes.
Squeeze the excess moisture out and place in a bowl. Squeeze wakame and add to the bowl.
Before serving, Pour the sesame dressing over the cucumber and wakame, and mix well together. Serve in individual dishes or in a large serving bowl. Serve immediately.

The next day, rinse the soybeans a couple of times and transfer to a large pot. Add 12 cups of water to the beans, and bring to a boil using high heat and continue to cook for 10 more minutes using medium heat.
Next, blend the soybeans and water in batches until completely smooth. We used our Blendtec’s “smoothie” setting. Transfer the blended soybean mixture to another pot and let simmer for 40 minutes. Watch it carefully, as it’s easy for the soymilk to boil over! Towards the end of the 40 minutes, add salt and sugar to taste (if using), stirring to dissolve.
After 40 minutes, strain the soymilk through a fine cheesecloth. It’s ideal to use cheesecloth, which will result in the cleanest and smoothest soy milk, but you can also use a fine-meshed strainer, as we did. If you use a fine-meshed strainer, you’ll want to let your soy milk settle before using it, as there will be some soybean solids at the bottom of whatever bottle or container you use to store it. This is especially important if you’re using the soymilk for coffee. If you’re using it for baking or to make a Chinese dish like Dou Jiang, a few solids are just fine.
Transfer the soymilk to a bottle, jar, or other airtight container and store in the fridge on the top shelf in the back to preserve it for longer!

After it reaches a rolling boil, turn off the heat and let sit for 10 minutes or so. Apparently, Chinese tea gurus say that intensely hot boiled water zaps all the nutrients out of the tea leaves, ergo the short cooling process prior to brewing the tea. (As with most things related to Chinese cooking that my mother says that other people say, I can't really confirm whether or not this is actually true, but better safe than sorry...)
Put the tea in your favorite kettle (or a large mixing bowl), making sure that it's either in a tea bag (you can actually buy these and fill them with your own selection of teas!) or a few metal tea infusers. (If you haven't got any of this equipment, you can also just strain the tea prior to adding the half and half.) Add the hot water and let steep for 15 minutes.
Now you're ready to add the sugar. Mix the tea and sugar thoroughly until the sugar is completely dissolved. Then add the half and half. For anyone who's squeamish about higher fat dairy, it's really not a lot per serving, as this serves four. If you want to sub in regular milk, go right ahead, but the flavor of the finished product is truly authentic with the half and half!
Put the tea in the fridge to chill for at least 1 hour. This is preferred over adding ice, so that the tea doesn't get diluted. Also, more authentic!

Our Phin Vietnamese coffee filters are the 6-ounce size, but they come in different sizes depending upon your brewing needs. Alternatively, you can use a French coffee press or your favorite drip coffee method.
Measure 3 tablespoons of ground coffee, and distribute it evenly into the filter.
DO NOT shake the filters or compress the coffee, or the coffee grounds will drop into the holes of the coffee filter and plug up the holes! The result will be that the coffee takes forever to drip, or the grounds may clog the filter entirely. Place the metal filter gently on top of the coffee.
Pour your desired amount of condensed milk into a mug or heatproof glass.
Measure out 6 ounces of near boiling water. Use 8 ounces if you don’t like your coffee with such a strong kick in the pants.
With the filter placed over the glass, pour two tablespoons of hot water into the filter and wait for 5 seconds to ""bloom"" the coffee. The bloom is the part of the coffee brewing process when the water releases CO2 from the coffee, and the grounds expand.
Next, press on the filter gently to compress the bloomed coffee. This helps slow down the drip rate when you use all of your water, and also makes for a more flavorful coffee.
With these steps, you’ll be able to achieve the optimum brewing time. That said, now slowly pour the rest of the water into the filter, and the coffee will begin dripping into your cup or glass.
Wait about 5 minutes for the coffee to finish drip brewing!

If you do want to peel the peaches, when they are in season and ripe, you may be able to peel them by hand without blanching the skin or using a peeler.

Add the all-purpose flour to the bowl of an electric mixer. With the mixer on low, slowly add the water. Run the mixer until the dough comes together into a smooth ball. 2 cups of water is a baseline. You may need less water in humid climates and more in drier climates/times of year (i.e. winter).
The finished dough should be soft and pliable, but not wet or sticky. Cover with an overturned bowl or plate, and let the dough rest on the counter for 1 hour. This gives the flour more time to absorb moisture, which will make the dough smoother and easier to work with. While the dough is resting, make the filling.
Take a spoon and scrape the fish meat a little bit at a time, discarding the tough membrane that’s left behind. Coarsely chop the fish (no need to make it into a paste-like texture at this stage). Add the fish to a large mixing bowl along with the rest of the filling ingredients. Whip in one direction using chopsticks or a wooden spoon for a good 5 minutes until the filling becomes gooey and sticky. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for 15 minutes.
Now we are ready to assemble the dumplings! When the dough is done resting, cut it into eighths. Take one of your smaller pieces of dough, keeping the rest of the pieces covered to prevent them from drying out. Roll the small piece of dough into a thick cylinder on a clean and lightly floured surface. Cut the cylinder into 10-gram pieces using a kitchen scale. Now take one piece, and roll it from edge to center with a small rolling pin as you turn the dough in a circular motion. The end result is a 3-inch diameter dumpling wrapper that has thinner edges and a slightly thicker center.
Add about a tablespoon of filling to the center, and fold the wrapper in half. Position the dumpling so that each side is held in place by your thumb and index finger (this is a two-handed operation). Then with gentle pressure, press the two sides of the wrappers closed tightly. At the same time, press the filling slightly downward, by bringing your wrists slightly closer. Practice will make perfect! Place the dumplings on a sheet pan lined with parchment paper.
Before you go too far down the road of making the dumplings, now is a good time to pause for a taste test. Boil a small pot of water just as you’re beginning to assemble the dumplings, and cook 2-3 test dumplings according to the cooking instructions below. Taste and adjust the seasoning accordingly before proceeding with the rest of the batch! You may want more Shaoxing wine, more vinegar, more ginger, or more soy sauce, for example.
Before cooking the dumplings, assemble the dipping sauce by combining all the sauce ingredients in a small bowl.
To cook the dumplings, make sure to cook them in small batches, since the filling is somewhat wet and the dumplings will loose their shape when left sitting for too long.
Fill a large soup pot halfway with water. Bring it to a boil. Add the dumplings, stirring the water slowly as you add them to prevent them from sticking to each other. Keep the pot uncovered.
Bring the water to a boil again, and then add 1 additional cup of cold water to stop the boiling process. As the pot of water continues to rise in temperature, repeat this previous step 3 until the dumplings are floating to the surface. The dumplings are cooked once the water has boiled after three instances of adding cold water. Scoop them out with a strainer or slotted spoon, and enjoy them right away with the dipping sauce.

Add the water into a small bowl and warm to approximately 100-110°F (38°C), about 30 seconds in the microwave. The water should be warm, just a bit above body temperature. Add the sugar and active dry yeast, stir to mix well. Let sit for 5 minutes so the yeast will activate.
While the yeast activates, add the cake flour and baking powder into your mixer bowl.
Once the yeast is activated, you should see bubbles on the surface of the mixture. Pour it into the mixer bowl. Mix it with a spatula a few times, until the liquid is just absorbed by the dry ingredients.
Install the dough hook on your mixer. Start at low speed, then gradually increase to speed setting to 6 out of 10. Knead for 10 minutes, until the dough is very smooth. Stop the mixer halfway through and scrape the dough from the sides of the bowl.
Add the shortening. Knead on level 6 for another 5 minutes. The dough should be soft, smooth, and easily lifted from the bowl without sticking to your hands.
Lightly grease a large bowl with butter or oil spray. Transfer the dough into the bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it rest in a warm part of your room, until the size triples, about 2 hours.
Prepare the char siu filling
Combine the stock, hoisin sauce, oyster sauce, Shaoxing wine, sugar, garlic, and five spice powder in a small saucepan. Cook over medium heat until boiling. Turn to medium-low heat and let simmer for 1 minute. Stir occasionally until everything is mixed. Once done, remove the pan from the stove and let the sauce cool for 3 to 5 minutes.
While cooling the sauce, add the cornstarch and 1 tablespoon of water into a small bowl. Stir to mix until the cornstarch is fully dissolved. Pour the cornstarch into the sauce. Stir to mix well. Turn the heat back on, to medium-low. Bring the sauce to a gentle simmer and stir constantly, until thickened. You should be able to draw lines on the bottom of the pan easily.
Transfer the sauce into a medium-sized bowl. Add the char siu meat. Stir to mix well.
Assemble and cook
Cut some parchment paper into 3” (7 cm) squares to hold the buns. You’ll need 16 squares.
Punch the air out of the dough. Transfer it onto a lightly oiled working surface. Knead a few times to make the dough into a round ball. Divide the dough into 16 even pieces by cutting it into 2 even strips, then further cutting each strip into 8 small pieces. Each piece of dough should weigh 27 grams. Use your hands to roll and shape the dough pieces into dough balls.
Wrap the buns one at a time. Flatten a dough ball using your palm. Use a rolling pin to roll the dough ball into a round disc that is thick in the middle and thin on the edges, about 2.5 to 3” (6 to 7 cm) in diameter. Carefully remove it from the surface and place it onto your palm.
Place about a heaping tablespoon of the char siu mixture onto the center of the wrapper. Wrap the bun by pinching two ends of the dough together, then pinching the other two ends together. Press the dough edges together so it forms a square bun with a cross on top. Pinch the two opposite edges together, then repeat with the remaining two edges. Now the bun will be round. Check my blog post above to see the step-by-step wrapping pictures.
Once done, place the char siu bun onto one of the cut parchment squares, pleated-side-down, then place it on a plate. Loosely cover it with plastic wrap to prevent drying out. Repeat the process to wrap the rest of the buns.
Set a stopwatch (or timer) after wrapping the first bun, to keep track of the resting time. You need to rest the buns for 20 to 30 minutes before steaming them.
Steaming
Depending on the size of your steamer, you might need to steam the buns in batches. What I usually do is prepare the steamer after wrapping half of the buns, so some of them are ready to be cooked as I work on the rest.
To prepare the steamer, add about 3” (7 cm) of water to the pot and heat it over medium-high heat until the water starts to boil. Place the rested buns onto the steamer rack, leaving at least 2” (5 cm) between them, because the buns will expand a lot as they cook.
Cover and steam for 10 minutes. Once done, remove the steamer rack and place it onto a trivet. Uncover the steamer rack carefully. Let the steam out and then transfer the buns onto a serving plate. Let the buns cool for 5 minutes before eating.
Cook the rest of the buns using the same method.
Serve and store
The char siu buns taste best when they are hot or warm. If you made them in advance, you can warm them up in the microwave or in a steamer.
Once the buns have cooled completely, place them in a sealed container in the fridge for up to 3 days.
You can store the cooked buns in the freezer for up to a month. To cook the frozen buns, thaw them completely in the fridge.

Prepare a small bowl with extra flour on the side.
Slowly pour the water into the bowl with the flour and yeast, mixing them with a pair of chopsticks. When the water is mixed with the flour, dust both hands with flour and start kneading to form dough. The dough should be quite soft and sticky. When dough has formed, dust the working surface with flour and dust hands again. Transfer the dough to the working surface and continue to knead the dough until the surface of the dough becomes smooth and its texture springy, about 5 minutes. Dust hands and the working surface with extra flour whenever the dough starts to feel sticky during the process.
Rinse a clean dish towel with water. Dust the bottom of a large bowl with flour and transfer the dough to it. Cover bowl with the damp dish towel and a lid (or plastic wrap). Let the dough rest until its size doubles, 2.5 to 3 hours (depending on room temperature) (*see footnote 2).
When the dough is almost ready, combine ground pork, Shaoxing wine, and soy sauce in a medium-sized bowl and mix well.
Mince kimchi into small pieces. Add it to the ground pork and mix them well.
The dough should be very fluffy and sticky now. Dust the working surface and your hands with extra flour and transfer the dough onto the surface. Use a rubber spatula if the dough is too sticky and difficult to handle. Knead the dough repeatedly and add more flour if necessary, until the dough has shrunk almost to its original size and has become smooth and springy again, 3 to 5 minutes. The purpose of this step is to squeeze the air bubbles from the dough, so the bun will have a smooth texture once cooked.
To make the bun wrappers, divide the dough into two equal pieces. Roll each piece of dough a few times into a long stick, then further divide to make 12 to 14 small doughs in total (see footnote 3).
Dust the working surface again. Take one dough and roll it a few times, until shaped into a ball. Press the dough to a round disc and roll it with a rolling pin into a round sheet. Try to roll so that that the edge is thinner than the center. The edge should be 2 to 3 millimeters (about 0.1 inch) and the center 4 to 5 millimeters (0.2 inch) in thickness (*see footnote 4).
Scoop about 2 of tablespoons pork and kimchi filling and place it in the center of the wrapper. Hold the bun with one hand and start sealing the bun with the other hand (refer to the video to see how to fold a bun). Place the bun on the working surface and work on the rest of the doughs in the same manner.
Place a large container or a bowl upside down to cover the buns. Let them rest for 15 minutes.
Add water into a large pot and place the steaming rack on or in the pot, as the case may be. The water should be at least 3 centimeters (1 inch) below the steaming rack. Wet a clean kitchen towel and place it on the steaming rack (or you could cut baking parchment into a round shape to fit the steaming rack. Cut a few round holes in the parchment so the steam can go through). Carefully transfer the buns to the steaming rack, at least one finger’s width apart. Cook the buns in two to three batches if the steaming rack cannot fit all the buns. Add more water to the pot after each batch if the water level is running low.
Cover and cook over high heat (or highest heat for electric stove). When water starts to boil, turn to medium high heat and continue to cook for 10 minutes (12 minutes if you make 12 bigger buns), until the buns are cooked through. Stop heat and let the steam release for a few minutes. Carefully transfer the buns to a plate. Cook the remainder of the buns in the same way.

Stir to mix well.
Add the walnuts, sugar, and water into a saucepan or large nonstick skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until bringing to a boil. Turn to medium heat. Let cook, stirring occasionally, until the water has mostly evaporated. Turn to medium low heat and continue cooking until the walnuts are glazed. There will be some syrup left on the bottom of the pan, and the nuts should look shiny without any crystalized sugar on them. The whole process should take anywhere from 15 to 25 minutes, depending on the heat setting.
If the sugar on the walnuts crystalizes, add another 1/4 cup water. Cook and stir until the crystals disappear. Set the heat to low when the nuts are ready to fry.
Deep frying method (recommended)
Once the nuts have cooked for 10 minutes, heat another medium-sized saucepan with 2” (5 cm) oil over medium heat until it reaches 350 °F (176 °C).
As soon as the walnuts are properly glazed, begin frying them in batches. Use a slotted spoon or spider skimmer to drain the nuts of any excess syrup and carefully lower them into the oil. Do not fry too many nuts at a time, only enough to barely form one layer in the frying pot. Remove the nuts from the oil when the nuts begin to float and turn dark amber, 30 seconds to a minute. Drain the excess oil from the nuts and transfer them to a heatproof bowl such as a ceramic one.
Add a few pinches of the spice mix to the bowl and toss them together while the nuts are still hot, to evenly coat the nuts with spice mix. Taste one of the coated nuts (be careful when it’s still hot), and adjust the seasoning according to your taste.
Spread the spice-coated nuts onto a tray lined with a cooling rack. Let cool completely before serving. Repeat the process to fry the rest of the nuts.
The nuts will be very tasty now, but will crisp up a lot more once cooled.
Baking method
While the nuts are cooking, preheat the oven to 350 °F (176 °C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Once the nuts are glazed, transfer them to a big bowl, add the spice mix, and toss to cover evenly. Transfer onto the lined baking sheet and spread into one layer.
Bake until golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Check on the nuts after 10 minutes. If they haven’t turned dark amber, let them bake a bit longer.
Once done, transfer the walnuts onto a tray to cool before serving. The nuts will crisp up once cooled completely.
Serve & Store
These candied walnuts are perfect for holiday gifting, topping on your salad, or simply serving as a snack.
Once completely cooled, store the candied walnuts in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 weeks. They taste the best when fresh (the first 3 to 5 days) and will remain crispy throughout the storage. If you plan to store the walnuts for longer, put a few layers of paper towel on the bottom of the container to collect any extra oil and moisture.",en-US,-1.0,,Omnivore's Cookbook,60,8 serving(s),249 kcal,16.8 g,5.1 g,20.1 g,2 g,,291 mg,12.6 g,1 serving,2.1 g,

Warm milk to approximately 100-110°F (38°C), about 30 seconds in the microwave. The milk should be warm, just a bit above body temperature. Add 1 teaspoon of sugar and the active dry yeast. Let sit for 5 minutes so the yeast will activate.
While the yeast activates, combine the flour, salt, and remaining sugar in the bowl of your mixer.
Once the yeast is activated, you should see bubbles on the surface of the mixture. Pour it onto the flour mixture. Add the heavy cream, egg, butter, and sesame paste. Stir with a spatula until everything just comes together (do not over stir). Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let rest for 20 minutes.
Install the dough hook on your mixer (I used a KitchenAid). Start at low speed, then gradually increase to setting 6 out of 10. Knead for 10 to 12 minutes, until the dough is very smooth. Test the dough by pulling a piece of it using both of your hands. It should stretch into a very thin and translucent sheet. The dough should be soft, a bit sticky, but not stick to your fingers.
Grease a big bowl with a thin layer of oil. Place the dough in the bowl. Cover with plastic wrap. Let rise until the dough doubles in size, 50 to 70 minutes.
Prepare the filling
Prepare the filling while resting the dough. Combine the softened butter with the sesame paste in a small bowl. Stir until it forms a smooth mixture.
In a separate bowl, combine the brown sugar, cinnamon powder, and salt. Stir to mix well.
Assemble
Line a 13” x 9” (33cm x 23 cm) baking pan with parchment paper.
Punch the air out of the dough. Transfer it onto a lightly floured working surface. Use your hands to form the dough into a rectangle so it’s easy to roll.
Roll the dough with a rolling pin until it forms a 17”x13” (43cm x 33cm) rectangular sheet. Use a dough cutter or a knife to slice off the irregular edges and discard.
Add the butter sesame paste mixture onto the dough. Use the back of a spoon to spread it out into a thin, even layer. Make sure to leave a thin gap on the top of the long edge without the paste, so it won't spill when you roll up the dough.
Sprinkle the cinnamon sugar mixture evenly over the sesame paste.
Starting at the top of the long side (17” / 43cm), tightly roll the dough towards yourself into a long log. Once fully rolled, make sure the seam is tableside down. Press gently to seal.
Use a sharp knife to cut the dough. Slice off the irregular part on both edges and discard the dough. Score the roll, once in the center, then in the center of the two halves, then 3 times between each quarter. Slice along the scored lines, making 12 cinnamon rolls. Transfer the cinnamon rolls onto the parchment paper, evenly spaced, in a 4 by 3 array.
Cover the baking pan with plastic wrap. Let rise again for 30 minutes.
Bake & garnish
Preheat the oven to 350° F (176° C). Bake the cinnamon rolls on the middle rack for 25 minutes. The top of the cinnamon rolls should turn golden brown, and the inside fully cooked.
Prepare the glaze while the rolls are baking. Whisk together the confectioners sugar, milk, and sesame paste in a small bowl, until it forms a runny glaze.
Once the cinnamon rolls are baked, let rest for 5 minutes. Drizzle the glaze on top of the rolls.
Serve and store
I highly recommend serving the cinnamon rolls when they’re fresh out of the oven and still warm. At this point, they’re super soft inside and crispy on the outside.
Once cooled completely, you can store them in an airtight container on your kitchen counter for 1 to 2 days. Due to the very soft and moist dough, the cinnamon rolls will have dried out a bit by the second day. I usually microwave a roll for 10 seconds or leave it in a 350° F (176° C) oven to warm up before serving.
For longer storage, place the cinnamon rolls in a ziplock bag, squeeze out as much air as possible, and store them in the freezer for up to a month. To reheat, bake the cinnamon rolls at 350° F (176° C) without thawing, until warm throughout, 10 minutes or so.",en-US,5.0,,Omnivore's Cookbook,160,12 serving(s),271 kcal,40.3 g,5.3 g,11.7 g,5.4 g,37 mg,151 mg,9.5 g,12 g,8.4 g,

Rinse the jujubes with tap water to remove the dust from the surface. Add the jujubes to a small bowl and 1/2 cup boiling water to cover. Let soak for a minimum of 1 hour, or up to overnight. Once done soaking, reserve the soaking liquid. Halve the jujubes using a paring knife and remove the pits by cutting them off. Discard the pits.
(Optional) Have a few extra tablespoons of softened butter ready for the forming process. You can use vegetable oil for this purpose as well.
Make the dough & 1st rise
In the bowl of the mixer, combine all of the bread ingredients. Attach the mixer with the hook, start on low, until a dough forms. Switch the mixer to setting 4 and knead for 10 to 15 minutes, until the dough is smooth and elastic. You can test the dough by stretching a piece into a thin sheet. It should be thin and semi-transparent without easily tearing apart.
Smear a thin layer of butter onto the inside of a big bowl and place in the dough. Cover with plastic wrap and let it rise until the dough doubles in size, about 1 hour.
Make the jujube syrup
While the dough rises, add the soaked jujubes and soaking water to a blender or an immersion blender cup. Blend until a smooth paste forms. If the mixture is too thick to blend, add water, 1 teaspoon at a time, until it’s workable.
Combine the 4 tablespoons of butter with the jujube paste in a small pot and light brown sugar. Heat over medium-low heat. Cook and stir until the sugar is melted and the syrup is smooth. Remove the pot from the heat and set it aside.
Make the coating
Combine the coating sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl, mix well. Pour into a medium-sized tray or a big dish.
Assemble & bake
Smear a thin layer of butter onto a 10"" bundt pan.
Preheat the oven to 350°F (176°C).
Once the dough has risen, punch it down, gently knead it a few times, and divide it into 4 even pieces.
Roll each piece into 4 long logs, about 1 ft (30 cm) long. Slice each long log into 15 pieces of dough, for a total of 60 doughs.
Grease your hands with a small amount of melted butter. Roll each piece of dough into a ball between your palms. Place each dough ball in the tray of sugar once formed.
Once the sugar tray is mostly filled, about half way through the rolling process, shimmy the tray to coat the dough balls with the cinnamon sugar. Roll the doughs with your hands to help coat evenly.
Distribute the dough balls throughout the greased pan. Sprinkle over a few pieces chopped nuts if using, and then drizzle a small amount of syrup.
Repeat steps 12 to 14 to fill the pan with coated dough balls, without pouring the syrup. Once all the dough balls are in the pan, cover with plastic wrap and rest for 20 minutes.
Just before baking, pour the rest of the syrup evenly over the dough (you can also reserve 1 to 2 tablespoons syrup to brush onto the crispy side of the bread if you wish).
Bake for 35 to 45 minutes. Check the bread after 25 minutes, and then at the 35-minute mark. If the surface of the bread starts to brown too much, cover the pan with a foil tent. Once done, the bread should be fluffy and golden brown on top. You can test the doneness by inserting a bamboo skewer and the skewer should come out clean.
Let the monkey bread cool for 10 minutes. Cover the pan with a large flat plate. Use one hand to hold the plate and the other hand to flip the pan. Remove the pan and now you can serve the bread.
(Optional) If you like the crispy side of the bread, you can flip the bread again and brush the reserved syrup onto the crispy side. Enjoy!",en-US,-1.0,,Omnivore's Cookbook,150,8 serving(s),345 kcal,60 g,6.3 g,9.6 g,4.8 g,35 mg,265 mg,27.6 g,1 serving,1.4 g,

Preheat oven to 160 degrees C (320 F). Line the bottom of each cake pan with two layers of parchment (see footnote 2). Grease the walls of each cake pan with grapeseed oil. Set aside.
Combine matcha powder, 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon of hot water in a small bowl, stir with a spoon until matcha powder is fully dissolved in the water. Add 2 tablespoons of cool water and whisk until matcha is thoroughly mixed.
In a large bowl, combine egg yolks and sugar. Whisk until the sugar is fully dissolved and incorporated into the egg yolk.
Add oil and whisk until fully combined.
Use a spoon to stir the matcha mixture several times, then add it into the large bowl. Whisk several times until matcha is mixed evenly.
Add cake flour and whisk until fully incorporated. It’s OK if there are some lumps in the mixture.
In another clean medium sized bowl, add the egg whites. Whisk with an electric mixer at low speed until the egg white starts foaming, about 1 minute. Stop mixer and add lemon juice (see footnote 3).
Mix at medium speed until the foam bubbles become tiny, firm and even, about 3 minutes. Add sugar slowly and mix at high speed until the mixture has a firm peak when you lift the mixer from the mixture. From here, you should move as quickly as you can in the following steps.
Add half of the egg white mixture into the egg yolk mixture. Use a whisk to mix gently, until the egg white is just mixed.
Add the rest of the egg white mixture and continue to mix, until fully incorporated.
Use a rubber spatula to fold the batter gently, until the batter becomes a consistent, pale green color without any obvious dark green spots.
Pour the batter into the cake pans. The batter should almost fill the pans. Bake on the middle oven rack for 20 minutes. Check the cake. If the surface turns brown, move the cake pans to the bottom rack and continue to bake until cooked through, about 10 minutes. Use a toothpick to pierce the middle of the cake. The cake is done when the toothpick comes out clean.
Remove cake pans from oven. Place two layers of wet towels or a trivet on the table. Drop each cake pan from 30 centimeters (12 inches) high onto the cushion two to three times. Doing this helps prevent the cake from shrinking significantly. Flip the cake pans and allow the cakes to cool upside down on a cooling rack.
When the cakes have cooled down, use a knife to separate each cake from the pan first. The cake should then come out easily when you flip the pan. Peel off and discard the parchment.
To prepare whipped cream
Add whipping cream into a large bowl and mix with an electric mixer, until it just becomes thick and can hold its shape. Add matcha powder. Use a whisk to mix by hand until the matcha powder is incorporated evenly. The cream should become thicker and not any obvious lumps.
To assemble the cake
Wait until the cakes have cooled down completely.
Add about 3 tablespoons red bean paste onto a piece of parchment and place another piece of parchment on top. Use your hand to spread the paste into a round shape, large enough to cover the cake. Uncover the paste and place the cake pan on top, to be used as a stencil. Use a knife to carve the red bean paste to the exact shape of the cake pan.
Place one layer of the cake on a working surface, upside down. Place the layer of red bean paste on top of the cake and carefully peel off the parchment.
Spread a layer of matcha cream onto the red bean paste layer. Place another layer of cake, upside down, on top of the first layer. Repeat the process, adding one layer of red bean paste and one of cream. Place the third cake layer on top, upside down. Use the rest of the matcha cream to frost the cake. Sprinkle matcha powder on top of the cake for decoration.
Serve the cake immediately after frosting.
For storage, cover the cake and store at room temperature after frosting. If you cannot find a container that is tall enough, you can store the cake separately and make the frosting immediately before you intend to serve it. Store leftover cake in an airtight container in the fridge, for up to 3 days. You can refer to these tips on storing a cake for longer periods of time, but I always prefer to serve the cake the same day I make it, for the freshest flavor.",en-US,5.0,,Omnivore's Cookbook,60,6 serving(s),,,,,,,,,,,

Heat the butter in the microwave until it melts completely. Once the melted butter is slightly cooled, add the milk, egg yolk, vanila, and sugar. Mix with a spatula until smooth.
Combine the flour, baking powder, and baking soda in another medium-sized bowl. Stir to mix a few times, then transfer it to the bowl with the wet ingredients.
Mix with a spoon or fork until a dough forms. The dough should be very crumbly. Use your hand to press the crumbs together until a thick dough log is formed (see picture in the blog post).
Transfer the dough onto a large piece of plastic wrap and wrap the dough. Continue shaping the dough once wrapped, so it forms a thick cylindrical log, about 2” (5 cm) in diameter.
Transfer the dough to the fridge until ready to use.
Make the bread dough
Add the milk into a small bowl and warm it to approximately 100-110°F (38°C), about 30 seconds in the microwave. The milk should be warm, just a bit above body temperature. Pour it into the KitchenAid mixing bowl. Add the sugar and yeast. Stir it slightly and let it sit for 5 minutes to activate the yeast. You can tell the yeast has activated when there are bubbles forming in the liquid and a strong yeasty smell.
Add the heavy cream, egg, bread flour, all-purpose flour, and salt into the bowl (add the salt at the end to prevent it from directly touching the yeast).
Install the dough hook on your KitchenAid. Mix at setting 2, until a dough forms, about 2 minutes.
Turn off the mixer. Add the butter to the dough. Use a spatula to smear the butter into the dough to prevent it from splashing. Turn the mixer to setting 6. Knead for another 14 minutes, until the dough is smooth and stretchable. During mixing, turn off the mixer and scrape the sides as needed to make sure all the butter is incorporated. Test the dough by pulling a piece of it using both of your hands. It should stretch into a very thin and translucent sheet.
Form the dough into a tight ball by pulling its sides to the bottom, then place back in the mixing bowl. Cover the top of the bowl loosely with plastic wrap and place it in a warm and humid part of your home. Allow to rise until it double in size, about 1 hour.
Shape the bread dough
Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.
Once the dough is rested, punch the dough softly to push the air out. Place the dough onto an unfloured working surface and knead it a few times. Use a bench scraper or a knife to cut the dough in half, then halve it again into four pieces, and cut each piece into four even pieces, so you get 16 pieces in total. For a more accurate result, you can weigh the dough so each piece is 62 to 63 g (2.1 to 2.2 oz).
Loosely cover all the dough pieces with plastic wrap and work on the dough pieces one at a time.
Pinch the ends of a dough ball into its bottom and place the pinched side down. Place your hand over the ball, forming a cage with your fingers and working the ball in a circular motion, applying light pressure with all of your fingers, until the ball is well rounded.
Place the dough ball onto the lined baking sheet. Repeat with the rest of the dough balls. Make sure there is 2” (5 cm) of space between each ball. Cover the dough balls with plastic wrap while you form the rest, to prevent the dough from drying out.
Once done, make sure the whole tray is loosely covered with plastic wrap. Place it in a warm and humid place. Let it rise for another 30 to 45 minutes, until the size doubles again.
Egg wash
Make the egg wash by combining the yolk, milk, and sugar in a small bowl. Whisk together until everything is combined.
Cover with plastic and place in the fridge. Chilling the egg wash will make it slightly thicker so it will stick better when brushed on the dough.
Shape the topping
Once the topping is chilled, unwrap it. Use a knife to slice off the uneven ends and discard them. Carve marks on the dough so you can slice the log into 16 even pieces (see the blog post for instructional pictures). Then slice the dough accordingly. If the dough is too hard to slice, rest it on the kitchen counter for 10 to 15 minutes to let it soften before cutting.
Place each piece between two pieces of plastic wrap. Use a rolling pin to flatten the dough without cracking it, until it forms a round disk that is about 2.5” (6 cm) in diameter and 1/4” (5 mm) thick. The dough will be very crumbly and the ends might crack a bit (it’s totally OK!). If you find the dough too difficult to roll out without cracking, you can use your hand to lightly flatten it instead of rolling it. (*Footnote 1)
Place the rolled/pressed topping disks onto a large sheet of plastic wrap using a thin spatula (you can also stack them together by placing plastic wrap or parchment paper between each piece of dough). Cover with plastic wrap until you’re ready to assemble the buns. (*Footnote 2)
Assemble and bake
Preheat the oven to 350° F (176° C).
Once the bread dough has risen again, remove the plastic wrap. Gently place the topping dough disks onto the bread dough rolls.
Brush all the buns with egg wash. Allow the egg to dry slightly. Then brush them again for a second time to get the beautiful yellow color.
Bake for 15 to 17 minutes, until the top is golden yellow and the bottom is slightly browned.
Let the buns rest in the pan for 5 minutes, then transfer them onto a cooling rack.
Serve warm or at room temperature.
Store
Once the pineapple buns have cooled completely, you can store them in an airtight container on your kitchen counter for up to 2 days. The rolls will stay delicious at room temperature. You can also warm them up in the microwave for 10 seconds or leave them in a 350° F (176° C) oven to warm before serving.
For longer storage, place the dinner rolls in a ziplock bag, squeeze out as much air as possible, and store them in the freezer for up to a month.

Place pumpkin on steaming rack, skin side down. Cover pot and bring to a boil over medium high heat. Turn to low heat and steam until you the pumpkin can easily be pierced with a fork, about 15 minutes. Transfer pumpkin to a plate to cool.
Scoop the pumpkin flesh from the skin and add it into a large bowl. Smash into paste. The pumpkin yielded 340 grams (12 ounces) of paste in my case.
Slowly blend glutinous rice flour into pumpkin paste, about 2 tablespoons at a time. Whisk with a pair of chopsticks (or a fork), until flour is fully cooperated. Add more flour and keep mixing, until the flour becomes difficult to blend. Dust both hands with rice flour. Knead the dough together with one hand, until it forms a consistent and soft dough. The dough should be easily picked up by hand and should stick to the bottom of the bowl a bit. Pick up the dough and use both hands to press and knead the dough for another 5 minutes to blend the rice flour in well. The surface of the dough should be smooth and you shouldn't notice any stray flour on or inside the dough.
Put bread crumbs in a small bowl and set aside.
Blend peanuts and brown sugar in a medium sized bowl. Slowly add 1 tablespoon water and mix with a fork.
Divide the dough into 4 equal parts, then divide each part into 4 small pieces. Shape each small piece into a dough ball with both hands.
To make pumpkin buns: Hold a dough ball in one hand and use the other hand to press it into a flat, round shape, about 5 centimeters (2 inches) in diameter. Add about 1 teaspoon of peanut filling in the center of the dough. Wrap the dough around the filling and pinch the edges together, forming a ball again. Gently press the ball until it is shaped like a mini pancake, 1 - 1.5 centimeters (0.5 inch) in thickness.
(optional) You can use red bean paste instead of brown sugar and peanuts as filling for the buns.
Toss the buns in bread crumbs, and shake off any extra.
Process the rest of the dough in the same manner.
Heat a tablespoon of oil in a nonstick skillet over medium high heat until warm. Place pancakes in skillet. Cover and cook over low heat for 2 minutes, until bottom side turns golden brown. Flip the buns. Cover and cook the other side over lowest heat for another 2 minutes. Check the bottom side of the buns after 1 minute. If the color has already turned brown, turn off heat cover, and allow to sit for another minute.Transfer to a plate to cool off.

Add the milk into a small bowl and warm to approximately 100-110°F (38°C), about 30 seconds in the microwave. The milk should be warm, just a bit above body temperature. Add a pinch of sugar and the active dry yeast. Let sit for 5 minutes so the yeast will activate.
While the yeast activates, add the rest of the ingredients into your mixer bowl.
Once the yeast is activated, you should see bubbles on the surface of the mixture. Pour it into the mixer bowl. Mix with a spatula until the dough just comes together. Cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 20 minutes.
Install the dough hook on your mixer (I used a KitchenAid). Start at low speed, then gradually increase to setting 8 out of 10. Knead for 10 to 12 minutes, until the dough is very smooth. Stop the mixer in the middle and scrape the dough from the sides of the bowl. Test the dough by pulling a piece of it using both of your hands. It should stretch into a very thin and translucent sheet. The dough should be wet and a bit sticky.
Grease a big bowl with a thin layer of oil. Place the dough into the bowl. Cover with plastic wrap. Let rise until the dough doubles in size, about 1 hour.
2nd rise
Line a 9” x 9” (23cm x 23 cm) baking pan with parchment paper.
Punch the air out of the dough. Transfer it onto a lightly oiled working surface. Divide the dough into 9 even pieces by cutting it into 3 even strips, then further cutting each strip into 3 small pieces. Each piece of dough should weigh 68 to 70 grams.
Shape the dough one piece at a time. Tuck the dough onto itself by pinching the dough from all sides into the center using your fingers, creating a round shape. Then roll the dough in a circular motion with your palm against the table, until it forms a round ball. Place the dough balls onto the parchment paper, evenly spaced, in a 3-by-3 array.
Cover the baking pan with plastic wrap. Let rest again for another 35 to 45 minutes, until the size has doubled.
Bake
Preheat the oven to 350° F (176° C) while resting the shaped bread rolls.
Right before baking, gently brush a thin layer of milk onto the tops of the bread rolls.
Bake the milk bread rolls on the middle rack for 20 to 25 minutes, until the top turns golden brown. You can also test the doneness by inserting an instant-read thermometer into the middle of the center bun. It should register at least 190°F.
Let the bread rest in the pan for 5 minutes, then transfer it onto a cooling rack.
Serve warm or at room temperature.

Add the water into a small bowl and warm to approximately 100-110°F (38°C), about 30 seconds in the microwave. The water should be warm, just a bit above body temperature. Add the sugar and active dry yeast. Let sit for 5 minutes so the yeast will activate.
While the yeast activates, add the cake flour and baking powder into your mixer bowl.
Once the yeast is activated, you should see bubbles on the surface of the mixture. Pour it into the mixer bowl. Mix with a spatula a few times, until the liquid is just absorbed by the dry ingredients.
Install the dough hook on your mixer. Start at low speed, then gradually increase to speed setting to 6 out of 10. Knead for 10 minutes, until the dough is very smooth. Stop the mixer in the middle and scrape the dough from the sides of the bowl.
Add the shortening. Knead on level 6 for another 5 minutes. The dough should be soft, smooth, and easily lift from the bowl without sticking to your hands.
Lightly grease a large bowl with butter or oil spray. Transfer the dough into the bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it rest in a warm part of your room, until the size triples, about 2 hours.
Prepare the custard
Prepare the custard while the dough is resting. Mix the cornstarch, all-purpose flour, and half of the sugar together in a small bowl.
Place the egg yolks in a large bowl. Stir a few times to mix the yolks.
Add the milk and the remaining half of the sugar into a small saucepan. Heat over medium heat. Stir occasionally to dissolve the sugar completely. Cook until it reaches about 120 °F/ 49 °C (no more than 150 °F / 65 °C). You might see a few bubbles here and there. If the milk starts foaming, it’s too hot.
While the milk starts to get warm, add the dry ingredients (from step 1 of the custard) into the bowl with the egg yolks. Whisk until it forms an even paste. Do not add the dry ingredients too early, because the sugar will change the texture of the eggs.
Add the warm milk into the egg yolk mixture, about 1/4 cup at a time. Whisk constantly until the milk is fully incorporated into the paste. Continue to add more milk, a 1/4 cup at a time and continuously stirring, until it forms a thin, smooth mixture and all the milk is added.
Return the mixture back to the pot (the one you used to heat the milk). Heat over medium low heat and stir constantly, until the mixture thickens, 5 minutes or so. Keep cooking and stirring, until you can draw a line on the bottom of the pot using a spatula. (Note, the custard will start to thicken suddenly, like a switch was flipped. So you should keep a close eye on it.)
Remove the pot from the stove immediately. Add the butter and vanilla extract. Stir to mix well.
Line a large, deep plate with plastic wrap. Place a large mesh strainer on top.
Pour the custard into the lined plate through the strainer to smooth out the texture. Use a spatula to press the custard through the strainer if any lumps remain.
Cover the custard with plastic wrap. Press the wrap against the custard, so it won’t form a skin once it’s chilled.
Chill the custard in the fridge until it’s cooled, 2 hours or so. Or in the freezer for 30 mins.
Assemble
Cut some parchment paper into 3” (7 cm) squares to hold the buns. You’ll need 16 squares.
Punch the air out of the dough. Transfer it onto a lightly oiled working surface. Knead a few times to make the dough into a round ball. Divide the dough into 16 even pieces by cutting it into 2 even strips, then further cutting each strip into 4 small pieces. Each piece of dough should weigh 27 grams. Use your hands to roll and shape the dough pieces into dough balls.
Wrap the buns one at a time.
Flatten the dough ball using your palm. Use a rolling pin to roll a dough ball into a round disc that is thick in the middle and thin on the edges, about 2.5 to 3” (6 to 7 cm) in diameter. Carefully remove it from the surface and place it onto your palm.
Place about a heaping tablespoon of custard onto the center of the wrapper. Press the custard into the dough to release any air bubbles within the custard. Use your other hand to gather the wrapper onto the top of the custard filling. The dough sheet will start to form pleats and retain its round shape.
Once done, place the custard bun onto one of the cut parchment squares, pleated-side-down, then place it on a plate. Loosely cover it with plastic wrap to prevent them from drying out. Repeat the process to wrap the rest of the buns.
Set a stopwatch (or timer) after wrapping the first bun, to keep track of the resting time. You need to rest the buns for 20 to 30 minutes before steaming.
Steaming
Depending on the size of your steamer, you might need to steam the buns in batches. What I usually do is prepare the steamer after wrapping half of the buns, so some of them are ready to be cooked as you work on the rest.
To prepare the steamer, add about 3” (7 cm) of water to the pot and heat over medium-high heat until the water starts to boil. Place the rested buns onto the steamer rack, leaving at least 2” (5 cm) in between, because the buns will expand a lot as they cook.
Cover and let steam for 10 minutes. Once done, remove the steamer rack and place it onto a trivet. Uncover the steamer rack carefully. Let the steam out and then transfer the buns onto a serving plate. Let the buns cool for 5 minutes before eating.
Cook the rest of the buns using the same method.
Serve and store
The custard buns taste best when they are still warm, but you can serve them at room temperature, as well.
Once the buns have cooled completely, place them in a sealed container at room temperature, if serving the same day.
You can store the buns for 2 to 3 days in the fridge. To serve, heat up the buns until warm using the microwave.",en-US,5.0,,Omnivore's Cookbook,230,16 serving(s),121 kcal,21.5 g,2.8 g,2.7 g,1.2 g,43 mg,14 mg,8.1 g,1 serving,0.5 g,

Rinse the lotus seeds, then cover them with 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water. Soak overnight (or at least 3 hours).
Once rehydrated, drain and discard the water. Split each seed open with your hands, then remove and discard the green core if it has one.
Cook the lotus seeds
Option 1 - Cook on the stove: Add the split seeds to a pot and cover with an inch (2.5 cm) of water. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce to a simmer. Cook, covered with the lid slightly ajar (to prevent it boiling over), for 1 hour. The seeds are done when you can mash them with a fork and the water is milky. Keep an eye on the water level, as you may need to add more during the simmering.
Option 2 - Cook in Instant Pot or a pressure cooker: Add the split seeds to the Instant Pot and cover with an inch (2.5 cm) of water. Cook at high pressure for 15 minutes. Let release naturally for 8 minutes, then use fast release.
Drain the cooked seeds and add them to a food processor or blender. Add 1/3 to 1/2 cup boiling water. Blend until very even and smooth. Transfer to a bowl. (*Footnote 1)
Cook the lotus seed paste
Add a quarter of the sugar and a quarter of the oil to a medium-sized stainless pan (*Footnote 2). Shake the pan so the sugar and oil spread out. Turn the heat to low and cook, swirling the pan occasionally, until the sugar turns a light amber color. Do NOT stir, which will cause the sugar to crystalize.
Add the lotus seed puree and remaining sugar to the pan. Stir until the sugars and oil are incorporated into the puree.
Raise the heat to medium-low and cook, stirring constantly, until the paste begins to dry, about 5 minutes.
Begin incorporating the oil, a quarter at a time. Keep cooking and stirring until the oil is fully absorbed into the paste.
Add the maltose (*Footnote 3). Stir and cook to dissolve it into the paste.
Continue cooking until the mixture is pulling away from the pan and comes together as one piece, 6 to 10 minutes. The cooking time depends on your heat level and how much water you added while blending the lotus seeds.
Remove the pan from the heat and let cool before using. The paste will thicken quite a bit after cooling down, which will make it easy to handle when you make mooncakes or other Chinese pastries.

Pour the milk into a small bowl and warm it to approximately 100 to 110°F (38°C), about 30 seconds in the microwave. The milk should be warm, just a bit above body temperature.
Add the yeast and a pinch of the sugar to the warm milk. Let the yeast activate for 5 to 10 minutes, until the mixture is bubbling and frothy.
Add the remaining dough ingredients into your stand mixer bowl. Pour the activated yeast and milk over everything. Stir a few times with a spatula to make a rough dough. Knead with the hook attachment on setting 6 for 15 to 17 minutes, until the dough is smooth and stretchable. Test the dough by pulling a piece of it using both hands. It should stretch into a very thin and translucent sheet. (This dough can be kneaded by hand, but it is a wet dough, so having a dough scraper for the process will be very helpful. Knead it for 20 to 30 minutes in this case.)
While kneading the dough, grease the inside of a large bowl with a thin layer of butter or oil.
Pull the dough into a tight ball using your hands and place it into the greased bowl. Flip the dough ball a couple of times so that it is fully coated in the butter. Cover with plastic wrap. Let it proof until the size has doubled, about 1 hour in the winter, or 30 to 45 minutes in summer. (*Footnote 1)
Make the filling
While the dough is resting, combine all the filling ingredients in a small pot except for the diced char siu. Mix until the cornstarch is dissolved fully.
Bring the mixture to a boil and cook until thickened, so you can draw a line on the bottom of the pot with a spatula, about 1 minute. Take the pot off the heat and let the mixture cool off. Once cooled, add the diced char siu and mix until it is evenly distributed.
Shape the buns
Once the dough has doubled, punch it down using your hand and form it into a tight ball. Cut the ball into 12 even pieces (approximately 62 g per piece). Cover the pieces you aren’t working on with plastic wrap to prevent them from drying out.
One piece at a time, pull and pinch the edges of the dough to the top until the dough is round. Flip the piece so that the pinched part of the dough is on the work surface. Place your palm and fingers over the ball forming a domed cage, move the dough in small circular motions while applying light pressure to seal it.
Once all the pieces are formed, you can begin filling them. One at a time, use your palm to flatten the ball, then gently spread the edges until the dough has a 4 to 5” (10 to 13 cm) diameter. You should keep the center a bit thicker than the edges so the buns will be shaped evenly once wrapped.
Place a tablespoon of filling in the center. Gather the edges over the filling and pinch them together to seal it on top. Flip over the bun and roll it in the same circular motion as before to seal, but be gentle so the filling doesn’t tear through the dough. (If a piece of pork starts to poke out or looks like it’s about to you can pinch the dough over the trouble area and smooth it out with your finger.)
Place the buns on a parchment-lined baking tray, at least 1” (2.5 cm) apart, and cover them with plastic wrap. Let the buns rise until they grow 1.5 to 2x in size, about 30 to 45 minutes in winter, or 15 to 20 minutes in summer.
Bake
Preheat the oven to 350°F (176°C). (*Footnote 2)
Gently brush a thin layer of milk onto the top of each bun. Sprinkle with some sesame seeds to garnish, if using.
Bake for 12 to 15 minutes, or until the buns are golden brown.
Let the buns rest until slightly cooled. Serve warm or at room temperature.
Store and reheat
Once the buns have fully cooled, you can place them in a large ziplock bag. It’s OK to leave the buns at room temperature for a day. Store them in the fridge for up to 3 days or in the freezer for up to 3 months.
To reheat the refrigerated buns, heat them in a microwave or a 350°F (176°C) oven until warmed throughout.

Prepare the parchment paper by cutting it into 6x6” (15cmx15cm) squares. Fold the square in half, fold again, and then unfold it, so it shows a cross in the center. Cut four 2.5” (6.5 cm) slits along the fold lines. This will help the parchment paper easily fit into the muffin tin to form a tall cup.
Prepare the egg yolk mixture
Preheat the oven to 325°F (163°C).
Prepare one large bowl and one medium sized bowl. Separate the eggs, placing the egg yolks into the medium bowl and the whites into the large bowl. Store the bowl with the egg whites in the fridge while preparing the rest of the ingredients.
Measure out the sugar and transfer 3 tablespoons of it into a separate small bowl. If you’re using a scale, measure out 25 g and 40 g sugar separately.
Beat the egg yolks with an electric mixer, and slowly add the 25 g (3 tablespoons) sugar. Mix until silky and lighter in color.
Add the milk, oil, and vanilla. Mix again until it’s evenly incorporated.
Set a mesh colander over the bowl. Sift the cake flour and cornstarch into the egg yolk mixture. Beat until just combined. Set aside.
Prepare the egg white mixture
Transfer the bowl with the egg whites to your working station. Add the lemon juice. Beat with the electric mixer, starting at low speed and gradually turning to high. Slowly add the sugar and whip until it forms stiff peaks when you pull out the mixer.
Add 1/3 of the whipped egg whites to the yolk mixture. Gently fold them in with a spatula. Once fully combined (it’s OK to have a few lumps), add the folded mixture back to the big bowl with the egg whites. Fold them in using the spatula.
Assemble the cake and bake
For ease of process, you can add the mixture to a piping bag. To do this, line a 1-gallon ziplock over a tall bowl or large measuring cup. Pour the egg cake mixture into the bag. Carefully cut off the tip of the bag when you’re ready to pour the mixture.
One at a time, place a parchment square in a muffin tin and press it down to fill the muffin cup. Pour in the batter until it just reaches the top of the muffin tin. Repeat with the remaining papers and batter.
Bake for 18 to 20 minutes, until the tops are golden brown. To test doneness, insert a toothpick to the center of the cake and it should come out clean.
Once done baking, carefully remove the cakes from the muffin tin and lay them on the side on a wire rack. This step will help the cakes cool without deflating too much. (*Footnote 3)
The cakes will weep, but to avoid full sinkage it is recommended that you take them out of the muffin tin and lay them on their side to cool.
Enjoy the cakes once cooled.
Storage

Sift the water dough flours, sugar, and salt into the bowl of a stand mixer. Add the butter and ice water. Mix with a spatula until a rough dough forms. Place the bowl in the mixer with the dough hook attachment. Drape a piece of the dough over the hook. Turn the mixer to setting 4 and knead until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. Depending on the size of your mixer, it may be necessary to stop the kneading occasionally and lift the dough over the hook (*Footnote 3). To test the dough, stretch it into a thin semi transparent sheet and it should hold well. Knead in the mixer for a bit longer, if needed. Once done, cover the dough and rest for 10 minutes.
Make the oil dough
Combine the low-gluten flour and shortening in a medium-sized bowl. Mix and press it together using your hands, until dough shapes. Further shape and knead it on a working surface until uniform and smooth. Cover and rest for 5 minutes.
Make the filling
Divide your choice of filling paste into 25g balls. Flatten each ball into a 2.5”(6.5 cm) disc and place a yolk in the center. Gently press the paste around the yolk to cover the yolk completely. Try to press out any air bubbles and prevent from damaging the yolk. Once the yolk is fully covered, roll it between your hands to smooth it out until it forms a smooth ball.
Prepare the pastry dough (*Footnote 4)
Divide the water dough into 16 even pieces, 10 g per piece. Work on one dough at a time, use your hands to pull the dough towards the center, until it forms a ball. Pinch to seal the end and set aside. Always cover the dough with plastic wrap.
Divide the oil dough into 16 even pieces, 10 g per piece. Form each piece into dough balls using your hands and cover them.
Flatten a ball of water dough with your palm and spread it with your fingers so that the center is thicker than the edges, about 2.5” (6.5 cm) wide. Place a ball of oil dough in the center. Lift the edges of the water dough over the oil dough to wrap it and pinch at the top to seal it. Set it aside and cover it. Repeat with all pieces of dough.
Assemble
Preheat the oven to 350°F (176°C).
Take a formed ball, sealed-side down, and flatten it with your palm. Gently roll it into a 5” (12.5 cm) long strip. Flip it over so it’s seam-side up. Starting from the short side, roll it into a thick jelly roll. Turn the roll 90° and flatten it with your hand. Again roll it into a 5”(12.5 cm) strip and then into a jelly roll. Cover and set aside. Repeat with the remaining balls.
Beginning with the first roll you made, take a roll and press into the middle so the swirled ends are pressed out. Then fold the swirled ends into the center and press them down so that a flat disc is formed. Roll this disc out so that it is 5” (12.5 cm) in diameter. Place the filling in the center. Lift and stretch the dough over the paste ball to cover completely, and pinch to seal. Roll between your palms to smooth it out. Repeat with all the dough and cover all the dough pieces with plastic wrap as you do so. (*Footnote 5)
Line a baking tray with parchment paper. Place the pastries on it, at least 1” (2.5) apart.
Lightly beat the yolk. Brush a thin layer of the egg wash onto the tops of the pastries. Wait 5 minutes and brush with a second layer of yolk.
Wet your fingertip with water and dip it into the sesame seeds so the seeds stick to your finger. Tap the top of each pastry to decorate.
Bake at 350°F (176°C) for 15 to 20 minutes, until the egg wash turns golden and the pastries are cooked through and flaky. Once done, remove from the baking sheet from the oven and let cool for 15 minutes before serving.
Storage
After completely cooling, you can store the baked mooncakes in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 4 days, in the fridge up to 2 weeks, or in the freezer for 3 months.",en-US,-1.0,,Omnivore's Cookbook,60,16 serving(s),182 kcal,15.8 g,5.8 g,10.5 g,4 g,241 mg,115 mg,0.9 g,1 serving,0.9 g,

Add butter and sugar into a big bowl. Use a hand-blender set on low speed or a wooden spatula to mix for 2 to 3 minutes, until it forms an even, white, and fluffy mixture.
Add the honey. Stir until it is incorporated completely.
Gather the mixture into a ball shape and use your spatula to divide it into two even pieces. Transfer one piece to another big bowl.
Add the black sesame paste into one bowl and add the Chinese sesame paste (or tahini) into the other bowl. Stir separately to mix well.
Add the flour and 1/8 teaspoon of salt into each bowl. Stir with a spatula until it forms a dough. The dough should be soft but maintain its shape. If your dough is too wet, add more flour, one tablespoon at a time, and mix with a spatula until incorporated. If your dough is too dry, add a few drops of vegetable oil and mix again.
Place a piece of parchment paper onto your working surface. Transfer one dough ball onto the paper. Use your hands to gently shape it into a rectangular block, about 5.5” (14cm) x 3” (7.5 cm) x 1” (2.5 cm). Wrap the parchment paper around the block so it’s completely covered while maintaining the shape. Transfer it to the freezer to chill for at least 20 minutes or in the fridge for 2 hours, until firm. Repeat the process to chill the other dough.
Assemble the cookies
Once the doughs are chilled, work on them one at a time to cut them into rectangular sticks. To cut the dough, slice it into 1/2” (1 cm) pieces, then evenly divide the pieces into long strips that are 1/2” (1 cm) tall and 1/2” (1 cm) thick.
To assemble, place three strips together, alternating the colors. Then place another three strips on top of the bottom ones, alternating the colors again. Gently press them together to form the checkerboard log.
(Optional) Spread the roasted sesame seeds onto a piece of parchment paper. Place the checkerboard log onto the seeds, one side at a time, and press gently so the sesame seeds stick the surface.
Wrap the checkerboard log with parchment paper again and chill for another 20 minutes in the freezer, until the dough doesn’t feel soft when you touch the surface. Or you can leave the dough in the freezer until you’re ready to bake. In this case, place the parchment wrapped cookie dough in a ziplock bag to prevent the dough from drying out. If the cookie dough is too hard to cut, let it rest on the kitchen counter for 5 to 10 minutes to soften before cutting.
Baking
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C). Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.
Transfer the fully chilled checkerboard log onto a cutting board. Slice it into 1/4” (0.6 cm) pieces, and place it on the lined baking sheet. Make sure to leave about 1” (2 cm) of space between the cookies. You might need to bake the cookies in two batches. Bake for 15 minutes, until the bottom is browned and the center sets.
Leave the cookies on the baking sheet to chill for 10 to 15 minutes, until they firm up and don’t fall apart when you lift them. Use a spatula to carefully transfer the cookies onto a cooling rack or a large plate without overlapping. Let cool completely. The cookies will firm up once they reach room temperature.
The cookies are ready now. You can also store them in a sealed jar or ziplock bag at room temperature for 5 days. If you plan to store them longer, layer the cookies on parchment paper without overlapping in an airtight container, placing parchment paper between layers. Freeze for up to 6 months. Thaw the cookies in the fridge overnight, then on your kitchen counter until they warm to room temperature before serving.
Enjoy the cookies with coffee or tea!",en-US,-1.0,,Omnivore's Cookbook,120,40 serving(s),79 kcal,8.3 g,1.1 g,4.7 g,2.3 g,12 mg,42 mg,3.9 g,1 cookie,0.3 g,
